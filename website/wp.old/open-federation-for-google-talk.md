Quite a lot has happened during time when I was away from this blog and
I'll probably talk about some of it in next few days, but I'd like to
start with news from Google.

I wrote a [badly written post](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=14) when
Google Talk was unveiled. What bothered me most was the fact that it
didn't communicate with anybody and was in fact another walled garden.

Well, they [fixed
it](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html "Open federation announcement")
and Google Talk now actually talks to other jabber servers including
ours.

There are some problems with presence notification, but it's hard to say
yet who's fault it is and I wouldn't be surprised if it was ours. Sad
thing about jabber is that there are few if any open source server
implementations that wouldn't be just a notch above suck.

In short run this won't change much. Most people will still be on
competing services and it might be difficult to get them off. But as a
newborn optimist I see a promise of an open, working IM, where you're
not tied to wishes and development of one company even when that company
is mine. And that can only be good.
