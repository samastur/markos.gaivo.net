Being the other Marko I can say this workshop will totally rock. It has
to, because AJAX is cool, right? Instant fame, riches and all that.

Seriously though, I do believe it will be a great experience for those
who'll attend. Everyone is welcome, but only first 10, sorry, 9
[registered](http://web.zen.si/archives/2006/04/ajax-workshop/) will get
this chance because of limits imposed on us by the choice of venue. It's
even free (not likely to happen again any time soon), so price can be
hardly something to worry about.

You can also help us make it better for you by contributing websites
you'd like to see getting a makeover and telling us as much as you can
about what you'd like to hear there (and what not).

**Update: Workshop is full and registration is closed. I'm sorry not
everyone will get a chance to participate, but we might do another one
later this year.**
