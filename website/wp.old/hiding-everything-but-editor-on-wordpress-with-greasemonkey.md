[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 "Greasemonkey home")
scripts recently and since I am also a fan of this Firefox
[extension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add-on_%28Mozilla%29 "Add-on (Mozilla)"),
I thought I might share one myself. It's a script I am using right now,
while I am typing this post.

Script hides everything but editor on "Create New Post" page in
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress"). It also adds a toggle to
the right which you can use to control visibility of hidden parts.

I did this because I don't want to be distracted when I am writing and
close-to-empty page helps me stay focused. If you're like me, then
please [download](markos.gaivo.net/examples/lovelywp.user.js) the
script.
