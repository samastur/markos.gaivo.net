I'll be giving a talk at
[NEST](http://www.slo-tech.com/ostalo/nest2006/) this Saturday with a
catchall title "AJAX in jaz" (AJAX and me). Since the title gives me
quite a lot of breathing space and I'm willing to take more if
necessary, I'd like to hear from everyone who might meet me there at
ungodly hour of 10AM.

I'd especially appreciate it if you could tell me what interests you and
what doesn't, so I don't waste your time. Otherwise I'll just ramble on
about things I find important and interesting.
