It's nice to have friends, especially the generous kind who buy a new
[Nokia N80](http://www.europe.nokia.com/n80) and lend it to you even
before they had a chance to use it themselves. I'm not sure if N80 is
the best mobile in the world, but it is by far the best phone I've had
in my hands. I'm left with few excuses from finishing my uploader and
provided that other obligations don't tax me too much, it should be
finished in next week or so.

I've stumbled on two small problems. I'd like to automatically tag
images with phone model on which they were taken, but I don't know how
to read it. Is this possible at all?

The other problem seems to be a limitation of PyS60 API or its
documentation. You are limited to use of text as tab titles, which are
too small for this to be useful. That's why you see developers
displaying tab title in place of application title. Is there a
workaround for this?

**Update:** As advised by
[cyke64](http://cyke64.googlepages.com/ "cyke64's homepage") I found
[how to

phone model on Nokia's forums. My project has been hit with a setback,
since I also discovered there's no version of Python for N80 yet.
