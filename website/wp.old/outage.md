This blog and other content of less dubious nature were inaccessible in
last three days. A freak, previously unseen and therefore unforeseen
scenario happened where two disks forming RAID-1, which haven't shown a
single sign of a problem, suddenly died simultaneously. As has been
noted, a million to one chance scenarios crop up 9 times out of 10, so
firm steps have been taken to prevent something like this from occurring
ever again.

I've also rediscovered how I detest system administration and I'm happy
to have competent friends to absolve me from it. I used to earn a part
of my salary doing such work, which reminds me a lot of the war.
Prolonged periods of preparations and shear boredom are pierced with
short episodes full of adrenaline and occasionally terror of a fuck-up.

Another lesson form another unexpected discovery. I missed my blog as
much as I did my email. A sad discovery indeed, showing I don't prefer
listening over talking as much as I should. However, there's a silver
lining in knowing that I haven't longed for either too much.

So, this is it. Everything should be back to normal, but if you find a
dead link or something not working quite as it should, I'd appreciate a
line or two describing the problem.
