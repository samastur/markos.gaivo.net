To me the most annoying business habit is calling someone when it's not
urgent, even though you have his email address and it should be obvious
from your relationship that he prefers email to other means of
communication.

I hated phones since I was a wee lad, but I dislike them even more now,
because:

1.  They break my concentration; rarely for a good reason.
2.  They are invasive and inconsiderate. Just because it suits you to
    call me now, it doesn't mean it suits me.
3.  Whatever is said on the phone can be denied later and sometimes is.

Leave a trail or fuck off.
