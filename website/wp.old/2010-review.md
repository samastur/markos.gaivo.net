I returned from [Costa
Rica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica") two days ago
after a month spent there. It's probably one of few places where you can
have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I
wasn't back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got
plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9
degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and
spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.

But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote [my yearly
review](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=534 "Last year's review") and
it's time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel
disappointed. It wasn't really a bad year, even less so if looking at it
objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.

I guess it's been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost
exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a
cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent
memory. My stint as [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com "Zemanta")'s
product guy ended after several months and I still have mixed feelings
about the whole thing. I haven't finished much of what I started,
exception being [HTML
Lint](http://lint.brihten.com/html/ "HTML Lint homepage"), which was
mostly [Fry's](http://fry.si/outbreak/ "Fry's homepage") work anyway.

I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn't ended
yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won't be quite achieved. I did
however managed to emit less CO~2~ while travelling than last year.

I am more optimistic about next year.
[COP16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference "2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference")
wasn't utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of
30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about
personal projects and I'll try to raise my chances by not announcing
them just yet.

This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy
holidays to everyone.
