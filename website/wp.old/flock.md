I've been sporadically using [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) for last two
days and it's an interesting take on a modern browser and social
computing. Two features that I found most useful are bookmarks (or
favorites, as flock calls them) integration with
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and history index. Especially the
last one.

Flock indexes every downloaded page, so when you start typing a query in
search window, it presents a list of matches from your history.
Everytime I try to find a page in my browser history, I find myself
amazed at how many pages I read every day.

It's one of those in hindsight obvious features that I hope, expect
really, to see in other browsers fairly soon. It's just makes sense.

It's less obvious how you make money with software that you can't charge
for. Opera demonstrated (and Flock intends to
[follow](http://www.decrem.com/bart/2005/10/creating-sustainable-value/ "Description of Flock's business model"))
there are other business models that work at least for now. I hope it'll
also work for Flock.
