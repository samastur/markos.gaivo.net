We visited a wonderful exhibition a few days ago about two failed
Antarctica expeditions led by
[Scott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott "Robert Scott at Wikipedia")
and
[Shackleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton "Ernest Shackleton at Wikipedia").
I learned a lot, but what I keep thinking of are Frank Hurley's glass
plates.

[Frank
Hurley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hurley "Frank Hurley at Wikipedia")
was the official photographer on Shackleton's [Trans-Antarctic
expedition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition "More at Wikipedia")
(1914-1917). Shackleton and his crew encountered ice farther to the
north then they expected and eventually got stuck in it. It is
impossible to imagine how they felt when their efforts to free their
ship Endurance proved unfruitful and had to spent arctic winter on it.
Ship had to be abandoned by the end of October 1915 before surrounding
ice crushed it. Crew then spent next few months on floating ice. They
decided to seek safety on land which meant hauling what they needed by
themselves and leaving everything else behind. Which brings us to
Hurley's plates.

These were early days of photography and equipment was larger than it is
now, but even today's gear for taking large format photographs is pretty
big and heavy as are prints made with it. Hurley had two cameras, a
large format one capturing images on glass plates and a smaller portable
Kodak using film ^<span

than 500 images on plates which were too heavy to carry them all, but he
managed to persuade Shackleton to pick and keep 120 or 150, depending on
source ^<span id="glass-plates-2">[[2]](#glass-plates-note-2)</span>^.

Then he broke the rest.

I couldn't find an explanation for his action in one of the most
inhospitable places on earth where environment should soon enough
destroy those plates without his help, but I think I know why he did it.

Expeditions were expensive and selling publishing rights for images made
during trip was an important source of funding. Breaking plates ensured
them that their images would be the only ones that could be printed.
Breaking them was in essence an enforcement of copyright.

There is no moral to this story. It was doubtless a difficult decision
in even more difficult situation. But it is hard to look at remaining
images and not feel a real sense of loss. Such a waste!

If you are in London these days, then go and see this exhibition which
you can find at [Queen's gallery](http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/)
just next to Buckingham's palace until April 14th. I bet you won't
regret it.

**Update:** Exhibition closed and my theory is wrong. As visitor pointed
out (with Frank's own words) plates were broken to remove temptation to
return for them.

    Kodak, one of pioneers of photography, recently abandoned making
    cameras to solely focus on their soon to be dead image printing
    business.[↩](#glass-plates-1)

    Hurley continued documenting their ordeal with Kodak. Resulting
    images are more grainy and less sharp, but equally fascinating
    document of what they all went through.[↩](#glass-plates-2)
