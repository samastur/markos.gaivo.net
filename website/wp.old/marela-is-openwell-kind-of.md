[Marela](http://www.marela.si) is accepting new members. Only by
invitation for now, but it's not that difficult to get one. Just [email
me](http://markos.gaivo.net), if you'd like one.

For the curious ones, who'd like to avoid registration, it's best
described as [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) lite for slovenians (and
those who don't mind the language). It will grow in its own direction,
hopefully fast, but you have to start somewhere.

Those, who like programming might also check out its
[API](http://www.marela.si/dev/api "Link to API"). And if you have any
questions, do ask me or
[Sebastjan](http://www.trepca.si/blog/ "Link to Sebastjan's blog").
