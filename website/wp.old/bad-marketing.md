If you own a company, you're bound to be buried under an avalanche of
various offers. I got one from HP today, trying to sell me a color laser
printer with the following foldout (click for a bigger picture):

Mistakes happen and printing ones are no exception. But sending such
foldout to prospective buyers of printers?

Now that's simply stupid.
