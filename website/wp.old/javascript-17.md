I fairly often talk to developers with disdain for Javascript. I don't
blame them, since I used to share it. There are various reasons for it,
some more valid than others, but one that almost never comes up is the
very thing that bothers me most.

I was reading about
[features](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7 "Introduction to Javascript 1.7")
promised for Javascript 1.7 which should be a part of Firefox 2.0 and I
like lots of them. How wouldn't I when only few of them can't be found
in Python.

The thing is, most of the time I have almost absolute control of which
version of Python, Java or what have you I'll use. But when your code
lives inside of a browser, you're pretty much stuck with what's out
there and if my experience is anything to go by then I won't be using
new features widely before next decade.

Who wants to wait that long?
