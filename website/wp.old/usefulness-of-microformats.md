Another Wednesday, another talk. I was sorry not to see more visitors,
but I guess we have ourselves to blame. Talk would certainly benefit
from a better description, but it is a topic that I find interesting,
yet hard to describe. The running joke of evening was that we should
prefix all talk titles with PHP to lure all those developers who seem to
respond mainly to known keywords. It's a shame that curiosity is such a
rare trait after a certain age.

By the way, the guy who invented OPML is [Dave
Winer](http://www.scripting.com/ "Dave Winer's blog"). As fate would
have it, he's also father of RSS.

And it's RSS that I was thinking about later on, when I was
contemplating the role of microformats on web. First version of RSS came
out some 8 years ago and it wasn't until last year or two that feeds
gained enough traction to actually become relevant. Still, most web
users have no idea what they are and I believe really interesting uses
of feeds are still to be seen.

I also believe the same is true for microformats. We are at the start of
the road and we are yet to see really interesting stuff. I think there's
a definite need and opportunity to describe information on web in ways
more suitable for further use.

Rip, mix and burn. Or something like that.

But I still don't care about
[XFN](http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/ "XFN specification").
