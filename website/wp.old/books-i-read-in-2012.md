So I am not much of a planner. I didn't read tomes and I read few work
related books, but on the other hand I really enjoyed most of those I
did read. Still it seems to be a challenge for me to really dive into
world literature. I purposefully slowed my reading in second half of the
year with aim of getting work done which [didn't pan
out](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1058) that well either.

I suspect I also didn't read as many tech books as I wanted because I
mostly buy them in electronic form and don't enjoy reading books on
computer screens including tablets. E-ink readers are nicer, but
underpowered and have issues displaying code samples well. Postponing
decision is not working out, but I'm not happy with existing choices.
Not sure how this will be resolved or when.

Links in the list still point to Amazon, but without affiliate IDs and
are as always present only for those that are at least fine. Bold is
reserved for those I found best: *The White Tiger, Safe Area Goražde,
Bright Earth, Next World Novella, Behind the Beautiful Forevers* and
*The Sense of Ending*. If you are a web front-end developer, then you
should also look at *Undercover User Experience Design* and *SMACSS*.

The list:

1.  **[The White
    Tiger](http://www.amazon.com/White-Tiger-Novel-Aravind-Adiga/dp/1416562605/)
    by Aravind Adiga.** I bought this book by mistake and don't regret
    it. An astonishing and brutal portrait of India's underclass that
    grips you and doesn't let go even after you finish its last page.
2.  [Undercover User Experience
    Design](http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Experience-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321719905)
    by Cennydd Bowles & James Box. Excellent guide on doing UX on the
    cheap that is also a good introduction to UX. There are few people
    who couldn't learn something from this book.
3.  [The
    Redbreast](http://www.amazon.com/Redbreast-Jo-Nesbo/dp/006113399X)
    by Jo Nesbø. Gripping enough if you don't mind in-text ads for
    previous books or genre tropes. A good book for beach, if you are
    into that sort of thing. I don't see myself reading another one from
    this series.
4.  **[Safe Area Goražde: The War in Eastern Bosnia
    1992-1995](http://www.amazon.com/Safe-Area-Gorazde-Eastern-1992-1995/dp/1560974702)
    by Joe Sacco.** Certainly one of the best graphic novels I've ever
    read which can teach something about conflict even those who have
    been following it closely. Deserves all awards it got.
5.  [Object-Oriented
    Javascript](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-JavaScript-high-quality-applications-libraries/dp/1847194141/)
    by Stoyan Stefanov. An introduction book to Javascript (in browsers)
    best suited to programmers of other languages. Chapters about
    classes and inheritance are good reminders of less often used parts
    for intermediate Javascript developers.
6.  [The Habit of
    Art](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Habit-Art-Alan-Bennett/dp/0571255612)
    by Alan Bennett. Multi-layered drama with much humor. I saw its
    original production and I still think of it often.
7.  [The
    Stone](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140811514X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title)
    by Marius von Mayenburg. A recurring motif of modern German
    literature - doubtful memories of recent past. I would love to see
    it on stage.
8.  [We're with Nobody: Two Insiders Reveal the Dark Side of American
    Politics](http://www.amazon.com/Were-Nobody-Insiders-American-Politics/dp/006201577X)
    by Alan Huffman & Michael Rejebian. An interesting first-person look
    at how background researchers work in US politics without sordid
    details.
9.  [In a Strange
    Room](http://www.amazon.com/In-Strange-Room-Damon-Galgut/dp/1848873220)
    by Damon Galgut. A book about traveling, un-articulated rootlessness
    and failed human connections that switches remarkably well between
    first-person and third-person narrator. It brought up some of my own
    almost forgotten memories and I would recommend it without
    hesitation.
10. [Norwegian
    Wood](http://www.amazon.com/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375704027/)
    by Haruki Murakami. I don't really know what to think of this book.
    It's well written, engaging and reading it I do not not feel like
    time was wasted. On the other hand I don't see depth others see or a
    master writer others describe. Still not a bad book to pick up.
11. **[Bright
    Earth](http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Earth-Art-Invention-Color/dp/0226036286/)
    by Philip Ball.** I bought this book after I heard his talk on the
    same subject but still missed that it is foremost about painting
    colors. It is an amazing book which has significantly changed my
    perception and understanding of paintings and I would recommend it
    to anyone remotely interested in colors or visual arts.
12. [Tempo](http://www.amazon.com/Tempo-tactics-strategy-narrative-driven-decision-making/dp/0982703007/)
    by Venkatesh Rao. [Venkatesh's blog](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/) is
    among the most interesting ones I follow, but I was less impressed
    with this book on role of tempo in our lives and ways to work with
    it. There are certainly interesting ideas in it, but it often felt
    disconnected and too full of new jargon. I suspect I need to read it
    again with more focus and fewer interruptions.
13. [The Long
    Earth](http://www.amazon.com/Long-Earth-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0062067753/)
    by Terry Pratchett & Stephen Baxter. The first book in upcoming
    trilogy. Fun to read and well thought through look at what could
    happen if we suddenly had infinite natural resources.
14. [Innumeracy](http://www.amazon.com/Innumeracy-Mathematical-Illiteracy-Its-Consequences/dp/0809058405)
    by John Allen Paulos. Easy and interesting read, but it's not clear
    to me what the purpose of the book is. It's unlikely to be read by
    those who need it most or offer much in ways of tools and
    techniques. It is more of a cautionary tale of mistakes and lament
    about state of affairs which is still the same.
15. How to Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails,
    and Vanish without a Trace by Frank M. Ahearn & Eileen C. Horan. A
    warning book for those who are not particularly paranoid and less
    useful as a how-to. The rest of us largely won't be surprised
    although you might find out a thing or two. I hated author's voice.
16. **[Next World
    Novella](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Next-World-Novella-Matthias-Politycki/dp/0956284035)
    by Matthias Politycki.** A beautifully written multi-layered book
    about death, marriage, loneliness, memories... One of those rare
    books that not only can be re-read, but should be.
17. [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) by Jonathan Snook. A guide to writing
    modular CSS that should be easier to maintain and more reusable. A
    must read for web developers even if they don't agree or use all
    described techniques.
18. **[Behind the Beautiful
    Forevers](http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553)
    by Katherine Boo.** A devastating, uncompromising and
    well-researched look into life in an Indian slum. Together with
    White Tiger it significantly influenced and informed my view of
    India and I wholly recommend it.
19. [Dodger](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062009494) by Terry Pratchett. An
    enjoyable and informative recreation of Victorian London with a
    story a bit too predictive, straight-forward and far fetched for
    adult readers. Read only if you're Terry's fan or not an adult.
20. **[The Sense of an
    Ending](http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Ending-Deckle-Vintage-International/dp/0307947726/)
    by Julian Barnes.** Opinions may vary, but I recommend it without
    reservations. Really well written and was able to evoke memories of
    my youth without really describing it. I enjoyed reading it till the
    surprising and devastating end. Doubtlessly I will read it again.

This year? More useful education, more foreign literature and hopefully
one or two longer ones that have been on the shelf for a while.
