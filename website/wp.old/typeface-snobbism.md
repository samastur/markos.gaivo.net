We came from [Corsica](http://www.corse.fr/ "Corsica") vacation recently
and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south
of the island. It's a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent
an apartment in the old town itself - you might feel as a part of it.

We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and
very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who
lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a
page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.

Typeface used for suggestions was [Comic
Sans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans "Comic Sans").

I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing
more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more
despised and ridiculed
[typefaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface") around. My
unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than
others.

Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?

It obviously doesn't leave people untouched, since they keep on using it
when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers.
I've also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested
in type.

Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually
means) just as it doesn't make Madonna a good singer. It does however
speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply
unmoved.

Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for
children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning
signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn't
designed for.

If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it's probably more because it is
less general, less bland than, say,Â [Times
Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman "Times Roman").

In the end I have to admit I don't have a bigger point than simple
admission I'm not affronted by it anymore. I can't muster a will to
protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something
I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end
harmless.
