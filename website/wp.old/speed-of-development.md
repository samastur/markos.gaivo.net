[This](http://erik.eae.net/archives/2006/04/26/23.23.02/) brought a sad
smile to my face.

There was a time when Javascript implementation in Internet Explorer was
really top notch and other browsers had something to look up to (apart
from memory leaking, which is just embarrassing). But it's been 5 years
since last IE and it will take almost another year to release version 7,
which won't bring any Javascript related changes (apart from native
XMLHTTPRequest). I see myself as language minimalist, but [there
are](http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/09/09/23.05.56/) things that I'd
love to see implemented.

However, IE is not the only thing developed with glacial speeds. Even
though there's talk of CSS3, we only received (another?) working draft
of CSS 2.1 a couple of weeks ago. So, as many are not aware, even CSS
2.1 hasn't seen a final release yet even though it's been widely used
for a while now.

Slow development pace does have certain benefits. We get more time to
learn and master new stuff and what we learned doesn't age as quickly as
it would otherwise. But when limits of what you have rub you the wrong
way, it can be quite depressing to calculate how long it will take to
remedy this. Especially if you're bound not only to development of a
technology, but also to its deployment. Thank \<some deity\> this is not
an issue for me with Python 2.5.

In the line of work that I do, I can pretty much forget anything in
development which needs browser support, since it won't be deployed
widely enough in this decade. I don't, since I'm a geek, but I could as
there's little I can do with it and there's a whole history of great
promises that didn't make it in the end.

It does, however, pose an interesting question without an answer. When
should I start learning something new?
