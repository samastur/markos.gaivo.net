I've been too busy lately and many things suffered as a consequence,
writing being one of them. This is not a complaint, since I mostly had
fun doing what I did, but it is becoming obvious that too much fun can
kill you too. Anyhow, this is not a post discussing woes many would love
to have. It's a short list of ideas and thoughts that occurred to me
recently, which I don't have time to really think through or didn't want
to commit to [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter")'s transient stream:

-   I got a spam comment offering to kill a competitor's website for
    70\$ per day of downtime. It looked genuine enough to be a truly
    depressing comment on web's fragility.
-   "Does he have a [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook") account?"
    seems to be the most succinct way of learning person's outlook on
    privacy issues.
-   Democracy is a terrible way of solving important problems fast. Or
    solving them at all. However it does provide us with our share of
    blame.
-   I can't wait to see what [Nokia
    RX-51/N900](http://www.mobile-review.com/review/nokia-rx51-n900-en.shtml "Early review of RX51/N900")
    will really bring. [Here
    is](http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1343481&cid=29147349)
    one reason why. Building on a closed platform is investing in a
    lottery ticket.
-   Alex Russel's [Some Orthodox
    Heresies](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/2009/08/some-orthodox-heresies/)
    sums my view of HTML5 better than I ever could. Hard to disagree
    with his other points too.
