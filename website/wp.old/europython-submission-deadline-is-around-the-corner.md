April is about to end and with it also the deadline to [submit your
EuroPython talk](http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/). I thought about
submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my
current workload.

It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not)
Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.

I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality.
It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but
they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had
to miss last year, feels like home.

That's why I decided to volunteer this year. It's a way to give a little
bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.

So do submit your talk and come. It won't be the same without you.
