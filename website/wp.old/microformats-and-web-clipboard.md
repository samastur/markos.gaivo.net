[Fry](http://www.friedcellcollective.net/) gave [a
talk](http://web.zen.si/archives/2005/10/spletne-urice-2-mikroformati/)
about microformats last October and some people back then were doubtful
about their usefulness. Yesterday I read [a
post](http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/Blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry)
by Ray Ozzie on the need for web clipboards and accompanying formats and
my immediate thought was that microformats were perfect for this use.

Ray Ozzie talks about a need for easy interoperability and exchange of
data between web sites and I believe most if not all of us who are
working towards this goal agree that feeds (RSS or whatever) by
themselves are not enough. Web clipboards seem to be a big step in right
direction.

The post itself has since been updated with more information and a
[great
demo](http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html)
how microformats could be used as a clipboard format for greater
interoperability between different web services. You should check it out
even if you don't have doubts about the need for microformats.

I find it odd that these days I get more excited by stuff that's coming
out of Microsoft then out of Google.
