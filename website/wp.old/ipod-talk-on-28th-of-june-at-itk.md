**Update: This talk has been canceled.**

Kind folks from [Kibla](http://www.kibla.org/) invited me to give a talk
about iPod's (web) design lessons. It will be slightly updated,
hopefully more interesting and useful version of the talk I gave at
Kiberpipa.

Please do drop by, if you have time and even a slight interest in the
topic.

On a different note, Fry has

my day. Again.
