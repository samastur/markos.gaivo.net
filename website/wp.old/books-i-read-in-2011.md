I'm not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but
three are probably enough. So here's my annual list of books I read in
2011. I typed "this year" first. Obviously celebrating new year is not
enough for my mind to completely switch and I'll probably be in danger
of writing 2011 where I shouldn't for another fortnight or so.

This year I [stopped
striving](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=664 "Why I stopped") to read a
certain number of books and I'm happier for it. Looking at the list I am
mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice
of books related to my career. It's not that books themselves would be
that bad (most weren't), but why on earth did I spent so much time
reading things tangentially related to what I do?

I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To
safeguard from my tweaking of this blog's theme, here are recommended
spelled out: *Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight* and *The Unfolding of
Language*. I also want to specifically mention *Copper* and *Atlas of
Remote Islands* both great in their own way which are not bolded but
maybe they should be.

Last yearâ€™s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon
and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following
these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of
another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts
that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise
to fix it for next year's list, especially since I've never earned
enough to buy even one book.

Without further ado here is the list:

1.  **[Eating
    Animals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316069884)
    by Jonathan Safran Foer**. Great book that you should read even if
    you have no plans to become a vegetarian (or vegan).
2.  [The Cello Suites: J. S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a
    Baroque
    Masterpiece](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802119298?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802119298)
    by Eric Siblin. Who knew there is such a fascinating story behind
    cello suites and Eric tells it very well.
3.  [Hardboiled Web
    Design](http://fivesimplesteps.com/books/hardboiled-web-design) by
    Andy Clarke. I wish I didn't have to read word hardboiled so many
    times, but otherwise a must-own book for every web front-end
    developer.
4.  [The Yacoubian
    Building](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060878134?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060878134)
    by Alaa Al Aswany. I read this at the end of January, when Egypt was
    engulfed in protests against regime and it provided an excellent
    background to why protests were happening. A truly captivating look
    at modern Egypt society.
5.  [Buying a Fishing Rod for my
    Grandfather](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060575557?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060575557)
    by Gao Xingjian. Six beautiful vignettes.
6.  [Epitaph for a
    Spy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375713247?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375713247)
    by Eric Ambler. I don't read many mystery books, but I read this one
    with pleasure. It aged remarkably well.
7.  [Introducing
    HTML5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321687299?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321687299)
    by Bruce Lawson, Remy Sharp. A good, hands-on introduction to HTML5
    and related technologies that occasionally forgets to mention
    browser support and is already somewhat out of date. Luckily second
    edition is out (or should be soon).
8.  [Atlas of Remote
    Islands](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014311820X?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=014311820X)
    by Judith Schalansky. A beautiful book. A delightful way to spend a
    day reading about mostly unknown islands.
9.  [HTML5: Up and
    Running](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806027?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596806027)
    by Mark Pilgrim. I read this one almost back to back with
    Introducing HTML5 and there is surprisingly little overlap between
    them. It can feel too geeky and repetitive in places, but it has
    best treatment of data-\* I've seen so far.
10. [Life
    Nomadic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144953662X?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=144953662X)
    by Tynan. A book of anecdotes and lots of practical advices aimed at
    digital nomads, which has surprisingly large amount of useful tips
    for us who don't travel as light or for as long.
11. **[Herztier](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810115972?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0810115972)
    by Herta Mueller**. Without a doubt one of the best books I read in
    years and also one of the most heart wrenching. Literature at its
    best.
12. **[Skylight](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571176127?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571176127)
    by David Hare**. Great drama with amazing amount of substance.
    Probably not for you if you are politically right (wrong) leaning.
13. [The Elements of Content
    Strategy](http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy)
    by Erin Kissane. Good overview which confirmed it's not a problem
    I'd have. Or career I'd choose.
14. EffectiveUI by EffectiveUI. Overview with some concrete propositions
    written for audience that doesn't include me.
15. [97 Things Every Programmer Should
    Know](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596809484/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596809484)
    by Kevlin Henney. Mostly uncontroversial and insightful often enough
    to be worth at least a quick browse.
16. [97 Things Every Software Architect Should
    Know](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652269X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=059652269X)
    by Richard Monson-Haefel. Kind of like the previous one, only for
    software architects.
17. [Confessions of a Public
    Speaker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596801998/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596801998)
    by Scott Berkun. A fun book with lots of good tips which still can't
    make you a good speaker without practice.
18. [Think
    Stats](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449307116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449307116)
    by Allen B. Downey. I read this book too soon, before it was
    published. Content was promising, but code was sloppy and buggy.
    Most useful to (Python) programmers who want to learn basic
    statistics.
19. [Dry Side
    Up](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AH7GO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0056AH7GO)
    by Martin Ony. I know Martin so I may be biased, but I also don't
    like travel literature. This is the book I would get if I wanted to
    know how it FEELS like to raft through Grand Canyon. Fun to read
    even if you don't have such plans.
20. [Snuff](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062011847/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062011847)
    by Terry Pratchett. Felt a bit sentimental and certainly not among
    his best, but I nevertheless enjoyed it as I'm sure most fans will.
21. [The Chains of Heaven: An Ethiopian
    Romance](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O8MVGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000O8MVGY)
    by Philip Marsden. Interesting, insightful, fluid, but still travel
    literature. I liked it as much as I can like travel literature.
22. The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai. A rather uneven book that
    doesn't quite live up to praise it received. Sometimes brilliant,
    often not, but almost always tragic.
23. [Copper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545098939/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0545098939)
    by Kazu Kibuishi. A melancholic comic about a boy and his dog that
    fits my temperament perfectly. Most, but not all, cartoons can be
    found on web, yet book is still worth buying.
24. **[The Unfolding of
    Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805079076/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805079076)
    by Guy Deutscher**. Fascinating and well-written book about how
    human languages did and might have developed. Can't recommend highly
    enough.
25. [23 Things They Don't Tell You about
    Capitalism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608191664/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=160819166)
    by Ha-Joon Chang. A must read for free-market proponents and less so
    for well-read people. It contains some surprising information for
    everyone and is easy to read. I wish though there were more links to
    data in notes.

This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one
reason or another put off. I find I read too much from "Anglo-Saxon"
authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less
known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would
be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.
