Yesterday was a lovely sunny day.
[Sebastjan](http://www.trepca.si/blog/) and I were sunbathing at a
nearby cafe, sipping juice and talking as we often do about Python
related things.

I noted how I'd hate to see [Fredrik Lundh](http://www.effbot.org/)
being swallowed by the black hole of Google, where too often good people
go to never hear from them again. I simply can't seem to write anything
substantial in Python these days without relying on at least a piece of
Fredrik's code.

Sebastjan doesn't share my pessimism and he might be right. Forgetting
my possibly unsubstantiated fears for a moment, which Pythonista's loss
would in your opinion hurt our beloved language the most?
