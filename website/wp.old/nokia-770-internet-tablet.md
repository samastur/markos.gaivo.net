Dear LazyWeb,

I'm looking for a shop that sells [Nokia 770 Internet
Tablet](http://europe.nokia.com/770 "Tablet's homepage") and is willing
to ship it for a reasonable fee to Slovenia. Our [official Nokia
distributor](http://www.teleray.si/ "Official Slovenian Nokia distributor")
has failed me miserably in this regard.

Thank you.

**Update (22.12.2006):** Expansys managed to deliver navigation kit
without the tablet. Hopefully this problem will be amicably resolved
after holidays (since nobody could be reached yesterday afternoon).

**Update (29.12.2006):** Tablet arrived today and man, do I love this
little machine already.
