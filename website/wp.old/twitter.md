I have ignored [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "Twitter") for a long
time until it became obvious to me that lots of interesting stuff moved
there and can't be easily found elsewhere. So I made [my
home](http://twitter.com/samastur "My twitter home") to make following
others easier and occasionally tweet something myself.

So far I haven't really got a hang of it yet and my stream is as boring
as it gets. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come.
