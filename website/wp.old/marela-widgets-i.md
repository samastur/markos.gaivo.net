It's the beginning of August, heat is temporarily gone and I wish it
took work with it. But no, it's still lying there and there's enough of
it that I have some problems deciding what to do first.

So how do you solve a problem like that?

Personally, I goof off by writing something fun (still more useful than
reading blogs). For example a simple javascript file based on my [Marela
library](http://markos.gaivo.net/code/marela.html "link to Marela Javascript library")
that allows me (or you) to insert a single random image from your chosen
Marela photostream like this:

<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;size=2"></script>
</p>
If you don't believe me just reload this page and look at its source.

See? Told you.

If you want to do the same, but don't want to show my images on your
page, just insert

` <script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&tag=moja-izbira&size=2"></script>`

in your page and replace *markos* with your Marela username (contact me,
if you need an account) and *moja-izbira* with your chosen tag. You can
specify the size of an image with a number from 1 to 3 (2 being default
if attribute is missing).

I'll write some more widgets like this through August, if I don't change
my mind. Hence the title of this post.

Also I'll write Javascript for first 5 souls who need it as long as it's
a problem that won't take too much of my time. This offer expires at the
end of this month.
