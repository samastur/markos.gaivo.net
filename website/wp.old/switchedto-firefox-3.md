Today I switched to [Firefox
3](http://www.firefox.com/ "Mozilla Firefox") as my main browser. I
didn't want to, because as a policy I try to use most common version as
default, but I made a mistake of opening version 3 and since then none
of my old add-ons seem to work on previous version anymore.

If I was still a young pup, I would probably dive into config files,
search [the
web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") for
answers and try to fix it. But when you get to 34, time becomes too
precious to muck about needlessly and you just want to focus on things
you need or better yet want to do.

So version three it is. This has got me thinking about something else.
It's remarkable how difficult or simply an annoyance it still is to have
two version of a browser installed. Clearly this should be possible and
is in interest of everyone involved.

Anyway, enough of ranting. Time to get back to cutting cake...
