Back from Ireland, a place everyone should visit at least once. If you
have time, take a few days to explore Dublin and travel to west coast.
Those like me, who find abundance of national pride and flags creepy,
might skip Northern Ireland.

New development posts might take few days to appear, while I catch up
with everything.
