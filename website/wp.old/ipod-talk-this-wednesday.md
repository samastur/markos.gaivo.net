I'll be giving a talk this Wednesday at 19:00 in
[Kiberpipa](http://www.kiberpipa.org/index.php?module=ContentExpress&file=index&func=display&ceid=6&meid=25)
as [promised](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=113) some time ago. The
theme of the talk will be lessons learned from iPod about (web) design
and everyone is welcome to attend.

I'm buying a drink for everyone, who'll manage to stay through my rather
short talk and won't flee the scene immediately afterwards. The talk
will probably be given in English.
