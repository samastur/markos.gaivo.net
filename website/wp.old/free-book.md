I'll give [4th
edition](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jscript4/ "Book's homepage") of
Javascript, the Definitive Guide by David Flanagan to person who emails
me first.

The book is in excellent condition even though it's been in my hands a
lot and I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Javascript.
I'd still cling to it, if I haven't received 5th edition as Christmas
gift.

Lucky recipient will be able to claim it at next [Wednesday
talk](http://web.zen.si/), whenever it will be.
