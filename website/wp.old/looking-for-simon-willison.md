Dear [Simon,](http://simonwillison.net/)

If you're reading this, then Technorati trick has worked. Thanks
[Fry](http://www.friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/) and hooray for
modern tools. If you're not Simon, then you're lost. Sorry.

I've sent you a couple of emails since our conversation at FOWA and they
didn't seem to reach you. Probably just stuck in a spam filter as I
refuse to believe they are being ignored.

So could you please [contact me](http://markos.gaivo.net/) instead and
let me know how to reach you? Any method, even hand written letters, is
fine by me.

Thanks.

Marko
