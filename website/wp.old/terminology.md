It's normal and expected that part of every industry's terminology will
look weird or even obtuse to outsiders. But when a music executive, in
an otherwise very interesting
[podcast](http://www.podtech.net/technology/1015), keeps referring to
music lovers as consumers and to act of listening or even enjoying music
as consuming it, it just makes me want to <span

There's not any less of it after I'm done listening and I wasn't hogging
it in the first place.
