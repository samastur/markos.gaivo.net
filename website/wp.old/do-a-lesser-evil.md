So, Google [has an IM](http://www.google.com/talk) now. Nice that they
are using Jabber, but it would be even nicer if their server talked to
others too. Otherwise this is just another walled garden.

True, there's an offer to federate with others, but this makes as much
sense as having connection agreements between email servers. If they
want a really open IM, then they should let their server work as Jabber
was designed. Everyone can play and set up their own server.

On a different note, does anyone know of a good open source Jabber
server that can actually handle 10k simultaneous connections and doesn't
go crazy every now and then?

<em>Update: According to [Joe
Beda](http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249) there
are 3 reasons for staying close:

-   Missing code needed for interoperability.
-   They want to develop abuse/spam countermeasures.
-   They want to ensure everybody really talks to everybody.

I can certainly sympathize with first reason, if true (and I have no
reason to doubt it). But it's harder to agree with other two.

You already have a contact authorization to limit such behavior. If this
is not enough, the correct way would be to be as open as a lot of Jabber
servers are and switch on protective measures after you've developed
them together with Jabber community.

It also shouldn't be up to Google to dictate how open other providers
should be. That decision should be left with administrators of Jabber
servers and they shouldn't be coerced into Google's policy. Basically
they should keep the same freedom email server administrators enjoy
right now.
