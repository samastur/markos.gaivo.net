What are possible reasons for a class of products to go the way of the
[Dodo](http://www.davidreilly.com/dodo/ "The Tragedy of the Dodo")?

I can think of two. The one I usually hear about is development of a new
class of products that make old ones redundant. Popular examples being
ice or whip making industries. I don't need ice and when I do, my fridge
is there for me and I rarely feel the urge to whip our car.

The other one I can think of is a change of behavior as a consequence of
a different price point. [Burda](http://www.burdamode.com/) used to be
popular, but I can't think of anyone who'd still buy it. Price of
clothes and shoes have become so low that most people prefer buying a
replacement than repairing the old one.

I have flatfeet and highly value comfortable footwear. Disappearing
shoemakers are a real problem for me so if anyone can recommend one in
Ljubljana or Maribor, it would be greatly appreciated.

Besides that, can anybody think of other reasons for product class
extinctions?
