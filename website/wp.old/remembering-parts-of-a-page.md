Title: Remembering parts of a page

Every now and then, but especially when I build pages that combine index
of images together with a preview of one of them, I wish there was a way
to tell a browser to remember a part of a current page and apply it at
appropriate place on the next one from the same domain which also has
same ID.

The gist of a problem is that I sometimes want bookmark-ability of
separate pages without throwing away a product of an expensive
operation. I want my cake and eat it too.

This is impossible, since there's no way to actually store DOM objects
and I'm not even sure it's a good idea. Nevertheless, I certainly do
miss the feature.
