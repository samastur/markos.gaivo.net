When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost
literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly
Google Reader users or at least that's how I imagined them. I certainly
was.

Greader's shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together
with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around
would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good
time for late spring feed pruning.

I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly
wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the
time it was up again, Greader wasn't anymore.

Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and
goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if
anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.
