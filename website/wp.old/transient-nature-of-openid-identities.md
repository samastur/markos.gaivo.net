I'm still a fan of OpenID, even though it lacks solid solutions to some
of its problems.

Much has been said about risk of phishing and possible solutions, but
I've been more ignorant than some to a transient nature of OpenID
identities. Simply put, even if you run your own server, you don't own
your domain. You just rent it. Thus you don't really own your OpenID URL
either, which makes it a rather risky tool where some sort of permanent
identity is needed.

There are plenty of cases where there's no such need and OpenID is in my
opinion a better solution to them than existing ones. But it isn't good
enough where something less fleeting is required.
Maybe[XRI/XDI](http://www.xdi.org/) is a better answer?

I don't know. I'm still a fan of OpenID. It's just a bit less useful
than I first thought.
