I left my last job more than two years ago to start working in my own
[company](http://www.neko.si/ "Neko d.o.o.") and I never regretted this
decision. In fact, I have had so much fun I couldn't imagine to go and
work for some other company ever again.

Well, as saying goes, never say never.

I got an excellent opportunity from like-minded people to further my
goals of improving the state of Slovenian web, so from 4th of December I
split my time between [Neko](http://www.neko.si/) and
[Parsek](http://www.parsek.si), where as their head of development I'll
have an opportunity to raise the bar on what can and should be expected
from a modern website.

This also means I'll have less time to work on other things, so if you
are not a charity or we haven't talked yet, then I probably won't have
time to work on your project.

As year is coming to an end I'd also like to use this opportunity to
wish happy holidays to all of you and all the best in new year.
