Title: Publish date in TITLE tag (Wordpress)

I think it was Jon Udell who gave the advice to include information
about author and date of publication in the title tag of each document.
I think it's a smashing idea, but I have a problem.

I have no clue how to do it in WordPress. It seems every WordPress [date
or title
tag](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags#Date_and_Time_tags) wants
to reside inside of its loop and document title is firmly outside of it.
Anyone have any ideas?
