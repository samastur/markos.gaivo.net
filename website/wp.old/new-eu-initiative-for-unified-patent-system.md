The European Commission launched [a new patent
initiative](http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/38&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=fr)
that [hasn't
received](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060116105000582) a
universally warm welcome. I can hardly blame them, since I too remember
how unscrupulous Commission was when pushing for software patents.

I wrote [my thoughts](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=72) on patents a
while ago and they haven't changed much since. But if we are going to
have a patent system in Europe, and I honestly can't see it going away
anytime soon, then it's probably better to have a common, unified one.

Which is what this initiative was supposed to be about and since they
are
[asking](http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/indprop/patent/consultation_en.htm)
for comments, it's a great opportunity to present them your view. Don't
miss the deadline, which is 31 March 2006!

*Update: It seems there are* *[good
reasons](http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/68626)* *to be
concerned.*
