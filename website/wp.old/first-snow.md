This year's first snow fell couple of days ago and while I enjoy it
immensely, I'm getting more and more annoyed by our snowplowers.

Snowplowing in Slovenia is a state provided service without any business
competition and like most such services it sucks. In fact, we relive the
same story every year:

-   some time in the fall there's a story published, how everyone is
    ready for snow this year and there won't be any problems with our
    roads
-   we get a correct weather forecast a few days before the first snow
-   snow falls, plowers are nowhere to be seen and there's a complete
    mayhem on slovenian roads
-   snowplowers provide some meaningless statistics about resources used
    and journalists write stories about how they were surprised by the
    snow

Now, could you treat your customers and users like this? Probably not.

Except if you, like them, are the only provider of vital service. It's
probably still a poor business strategy because even if you are, like
telecoms used to be, can you be absolutely sure that this will remain
so?

Personally, I'd just like to know how is it possible fo them not to be
embarrassed infront of their family and friends.
