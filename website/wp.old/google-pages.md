[Nice idea](http://pages.google.com "Link to pages application"), but
very poor execution.

**Update:** It seems access to Google Page Creator is limited, so it
would make sense if I spend some time explaining what I meant. What
Google Page Creator (GPC) allows you to do, is to build a simple website
using your browser. It differentiates itself from majority of such tools
(but not all of them) in that it allows you to do this through a WYSIWYG
interface, where you can easily see exactly how your page will look like
when you're finished with it.

There are things I like. Page creator is easy to use and you get a
direct feedback on everything you do. Sadly, the overall impression is
less positive, since there's plenty I dislike:

-   GPC is incredibly slow. True, G4 Powerbook is not a top of the line
    anymore, but there are tons of web applications with similar
    capabilities (some of them mine) which don't drag their feet so
    much.
-   As others have noted, HTML produced is simply crap. Font tags should
    be extinct by now and there's really no excuse to produce them in
    2006. You can get a glimpse of the horror by looking at the source
    of my page (linked at the end of this post).
-   There are plenty of designs, but they mostly differ in color schemes
    used. It's hard to find one that isn't simply dull.
-   GPC is simplified almost to the point of uselessness. You can stitch
    static pages together and build a simple static website, but there's
    not much else you can do. I expected more. Something, anything that
    would make you believe the final result was done in the age of
    blogs, wikis and mash-ups and not 5-6 years ago.

In short, it's hardly an improvement over what was already available out
there. You can see [result](http://markos.googlepages.com/) of my
experiment and I posted [few
