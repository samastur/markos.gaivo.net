This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in
my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work.
?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my
thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can
say it is an annual event that you can, but won't, look forward to.

I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to
read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven't actually met my
goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read
and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very
short (which mind you doesn't mean short on value).

Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily
recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog
robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy *The Suspicions of Mr.
Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a
Solitude* and *The Pursuit of Glory*. Your soul will thank you for this.

Last year's disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon
and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following
these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of
another book.

1.  [Coders At
    Work](http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483)
    by Peter Seibel. Fascinating look into titans of programming, but
    you probably have to be a programmer to enjoy reading it.
2.  **[The Suspicions of Mr.
    Whicher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802715354?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802715354)
    by Kate Summerscale**. Amazing book. An intriguing never solved
    crime gets well researched to the point where it can present a
    plausible explanation of what happened. Also well written, so it's
    hard to imagine being bored.
3.  [A Smile in the
    Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714838128?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0714838128)
    by Beryl McAlhone, David Stuart. A compendium of different ways in
    which design can delight us. It's a topic that can't be distilled in
    a how-to, but it does come close.
4.  Fixed to Flexible: Four Simple Lessons about Cost, Price, Margin and
    The Options Available to The 21st Century Business by Todd
    Sattersten. An ebook I forgotten and hence can't judge.
5.  [Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and
    Fixing Usability
    Problems](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292)
    by Steve Krug. His first book is legendary. Second probably won't
    be, but it's still a very good (and quick) read if you want to learn
    effective usability testing on cheap.
6.  [Designing books: practice and
    theory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0907259235?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0907259235)
    by Jost Hochuli, Robin Kinross. A book about book design from a long
    time practitioner. Great read for us who are into that sort of thing
    and don't disdain swiss design, but it's likely boring to everyone
    else.
7.  [Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web
    Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321643380?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321643380)
    by Dan Cederholm. Dan shows how you can use CSS3 today to
    progressively improve pages. Not quite the same approach as Andy
    Clarke's (missing because I read it this year), but they both
    persuasively teach you to do more today.
8.  **[The Crusades through Arab
    Eyes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805208984?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805208984)
    by Amin Maalouf**. Title really says all. I started reading this one
    together with comprehensive tome from western PoV (which I plan to
    finish in 2011). I can recommend it even to those, who don't have a
    particular interest in crusades.
9.  [The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web
    Resources](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596518579?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596518579)
    by John Allspaw. A great first step into domain of capacity
    planning. Get it even if you only suspect you might need this
    knowledge.
10. [Arcadia](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515)
    by [Tom
    Stoppard](http://www.myspace.com/everything/tom-stoppard "Tom Stoppard").
    This and next 4 plays were actually in one book and I've seen a few
    of them on stage. Loved every one of them, each of them being a
    delight for mind.
11. [The Right
    Thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515)
    by Tom Stoppard
12. [Night &
    Day](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515)
    by Tom Stoppard
13. [Indian
    Ink](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515)
    by Tom Stoppard
14. [Hapgood](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515)
    by Tom Stoppard
15. [High Performance
    Javascript](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680279X?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=059680279X)
    by Nicholas C. Zakas. A book for every Javascript developer,
    especially those who think they know it all. If you learn nothing,
    then I salute you.
16. [One Dimensional
    Woman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1846942411?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1846942411)
    by Nina Power. I liked it, but have forgotten more or less
    everything. I'm not sure if this tells me something.
17. [Street Fighting
    Mathematics](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-098-street-fighting-mathematics-january-iap-2008/readings/sf_math.pdf)
    by Sanjoy Mahajan. More involved, but also more general approaches
    to getting fairly accurate estimates than in Mind Performance Hacks
18. Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto. Don't know what to think of it, except
    that translation seems dubious.
19. **[The Absence of
    War](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571170714?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571170714)
    by David Hare**. Great political drama that is still relevant.
20. [The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar
    Wao](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483299?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594483299)
    by Junot Diaz. Liked it a lot, but still having a feeling that I
    missed a lot by not understanding untranslated Spanish parts.
21. [I Shall Wear
    Midnight](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061433047?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061433047)
    by Terry Pratchett. Liked it, but I might have liked it more (or
    less) if I wasn't a fan who read almost everything written by Terry.
22. **[Too Loud a
    Solitude](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156904586?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0156904586)
    by Bohumil Hrabal**. Everything reviewers said: short, eccentric,
    playful and...a must read.
23. [Master of Shadows: The Secret Diplomatic Career of the Painter
    Peter Paul
    Rubens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387356?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307387356)
    by Mark Lamster. Insightful and often surprising even for us who
    knew about his second career.
24. **[The Pursuit of
    Glory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF4APO?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001LF4APO)
    by Tim Blanning**. Could be the best history book I've ever read and
    its lingering effect on me might make it also one of
    most?influential.
25. [Costa Rica: A Traveler's Literary
    Companion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883513006?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1883513006)
    edited by Barbara Ras. I planned to read this while we travelled
    around Costa Rica, but failed. I read most of it during our last
    days on the trip and on our way home. Uneven, with some stories
    quite good while others resulting in "huh?", but you do see country
    differently and I would recommend it to all who plan to travel
    there.

I also discovered [Granta](http://www.granta.com/), a really great
literary magazine through which you can discover new authors or simply
authors you don't know yet.

At the end I would like to mention a book I read this year, so it's not
on the list, but which I find too important to ignore for a year. It's
[Eating
Animals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316069884)
by Jonathan Safran Foer. If you care what you eat and especially if that
involves meat, you ought to read it. It's well researched and even
better written book that will inform you what "western" meat production
means these days. I don't think I can recommend it enough.
