I recently read [Raph
Koster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Koster "Raph Koster")'s
[Theory of Fun for Game
Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1932111972)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1932111972),
which I can heartily recommend to anyone interested in what games are
all about. But it's this part on page 88 that really got my attention,
since I can relate it to what I do:

> Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison,

> -   Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.
> -   Games are good at
>     [objectification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification "Objectification").
>     Stories are good at empathy.
> -   Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur,
>     deepen, and make subtle distinctions.
> -   Games are external -- they are about people's actions. Stories
>     (good ones, anyway) are internal -- they are about people's
>     emotions and thoughts.

A lot has been said in last couple of years about [game
mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic "Game mechanic")
and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites
more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still
more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.

But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or
customization?

Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually
means it wants to provoke action on visitor's part. Intended action may
be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be
buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or
subscribe to blog.

I've been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest
to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and
easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction
with a visitor.

E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by
visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull,
but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told
through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this
particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.

[Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/ "Amazon") presents other side of
spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren't there to read an
item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to
interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more
elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items,
reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.

I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some
elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn't be
used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites
purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you
make a more informed decision on what and when to include.
