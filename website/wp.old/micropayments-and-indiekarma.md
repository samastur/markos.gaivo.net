A few days ago I read about [IndieKarma](http://www.indiekarma.com/) on
Jason Kottke's
[blog](http://www.kottke.org/06/05/indiekarma-micropayments). I agree
with most of his remarks and I have a couple of my own.

I dislike the fact that IndieKarma is another walled garden. It means
that both the content publisher and visitor must use the same system for
transaction to occur and that's a lot to ask. Building a more open
system, which would allow transactions between parties belonging to
different systems and wouldn't be prone to abuse, is difficult and is
probably one of the reasons why it hasn't happened yet.

But I think it's also a necessity for small companies like
[PixelPass](http://www.indiekarma.com/About.xhtml), since as a visitor
I'm unlikely to use more than a couple of such systems. Same goes for me
as a publisher. If my reach is limited to websites using same service as
me, then they'll have a hard time getting traction. It will also be
impossible to compete with big boys if they decide to move in this
space.

IndieKarma is also a very apt name for a service that by its very nature
is completely voluntary. Even if it was widely used on websites, it
wouldn't amount to much without people willing to spend money when they
don't have to. I'm sure there are lots of well-intentioned folks out
there, but the enormous prevalence of ad supported services and the fact
that most users [will be
freeloaders](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/will-your-web-app-make-money)
makes me doubtful.

Still, it's a nice idea with approach that might work. I certainly hope
it does.
