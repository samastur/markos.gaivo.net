Title: Problems with reading CSS properties in Safari

I was playing with a [neat
script](http://www.jeria.net/?p=7 "Script for reading CSS properties of a page")
that reads CSS properties of a given element, but there's a problem.
Fetching background color of an element doesn't work in Safari, if it
was inherited instead of explicitly set in CSS.

Does anyone know how to reliably get that information?
