Probably the most common misfortune every creator encounters is that
something he thought up doesn't or won't work as planned and it has to
be changed. In a way half of work is done by just recognizing and
accepting that it doesn't work.

But how do you do that?

Our change of image navigation was in retrospect quite easy. As a friend
said: "You don't have to satisfy everyone, but you should satisfy at
least somebody."

It wasn't easy for me, because I was quite attached to it and I failed
to recognize it as a problem. And this wasn't even a close call.

So, how do you decide when to give in to requests conflicting with your
vision?

Relying on a personal hunch might work for a while, but as a long-term
strategy it's probably not much better than rolling a dice.
