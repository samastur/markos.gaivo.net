Last year I read [Aaron Swartz's
review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books "Last year's review") of
books and thought it was a great idea that I should copy. I don't know
why exactly. Maybe to better track how much I actually read. Or using a
goal to promote more reading when I felt I haven't read enough. Maybe it
was just to learn what topics drew me particular year.

Who knows? Probably all of these reasons played a role.

My private goal was to read a book every fortnight, so about 26 in
total. I read 37, some of which admittedly very light in content or
girth.

Time to present the books, listed in chronological order. I linked those
I liked and set in bold those I recommend. Unlinked were either bad or
intended for someone I can't relate to.

that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.

1.  [Mind Performance Hacks](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101534/)
    by Ron Hale-Evans. Surprised to see how many of them I discovered
    independently through years.
2.  **[The Cold
    War](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594200629?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594200629)
    by John Lewis Gaddis**. Fantastic short history of cold war.
3.  The Non-Designer's Design Book by Robin Williams
4.  The Non-Designer's Type Book by Robin Williams. Like previous one
    probably useful only if you know absolutely nothing about design.
5.  [Business Cards 2 More Ways of Saying
    Hello](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1856694771?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1856694771)
    by Michael Dorrian, Liz Farrelly. Worth a look before you make your
    own.
6.  [Here Comes
    Everybody](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114948?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143114948)
    by Clay Shirky. Astute and interesting, but might be redundant if
    you already follow Clay's writing.
7.  [Guns, Germs and
    Steel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393317552?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393317552)
    by Jared Diamond.
8.  Sticky Graphics: Create Memorable Graphic Design Using Mnemonics and
    Visual Hooks by Jessica Glaser, Carolyn Knight. WTF?
9.  [Thursday Next: First Among
    Sequels](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670038717?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0670038717)
    by Jasper Fforde. Fantasy series for book lovers. Enjoyed more if
    you've read a lot.
10. [Designing Web
    Interfaces](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516258?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596516258)
    by Bill Scott, Theresa Neil. Components of modern web applications.
    A book that should be on the shelf of every web interaction
    designer.
11. **[Reader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454894?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307454894)

12. **[The Wall
    Jumper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226739414?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226739414)

    by Adam Greenfield. Really late to the party with this one, but
    still a good and fairly unbiased treatise on intelligent tools and
    environments and problems related to them.
14. [Always Building: The Programmable
    Environment](http://www.hermanmiller.com/AlwaysBuilding/) by Jim
    Long, Jennifer Magnolfi, Lois Maassen. Optimistic thinking and
    examples of adaptable environments by people from Herman Miller.

    Parts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742)
    by Douglas Crockford. Concise but informative description of good
    parts of Javascript useful for most programmers.
16. [Stardust](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060934719?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060934719)

    Gods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061092177?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061092177)
    by Terry Pratchett**. In my opinion still the best book by Terry.
19. [A Theory of Fun for Game
    Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1932111972)
    by Raph Koster. Worth reading if you want to know what makes games
    fun and what to expect in future.
20. **[Aid and Other Dirty Business: How Good Intentions Have Failed the
    World's
    Poor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0091914353?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0091914353)
    by Giles Bolton**. Excellent when looking at facts of aid "business"
    (first 4/5 of the book). Weak when it comes to solutions with
    seemingly unlimited faith in globalism and power of a consumer.
21. [The
    Caryatids](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345460626?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345460626)
    by Bruce Sterling. Interesting and occasionally excellent, but a bit
    of a let down compared to some of his other work.
22. [Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right
    Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123740371?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0123740371)
    by Bill Buxton. Excellent book about sketching and its role in
    design. A must read for practitioners.
23. [The Buddha: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192854534?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192854534)
    by Michael Carrithers. Buddism seen through life of the Buddha.
24. [Archaeology: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192853791?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192853791)
    by Paul Bahn. Fun.
25. **[The Four Steps to
    Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976470705)
    by Steven Gary Blank**. I can't recommend this book highly enough to
    anyone starting a new venture. Absolutely a must read.
26. [The First World War: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199205590?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199205590)
    by Michael Howard. Short, but good.
27. [Everyman](http://www.amazon.com/Everyman-Philip-Roth/dp/061873516X)
    by Philip Roth. Facing old age and death, a book I liked more than
    my wife.
28. [Contemporary Art: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192806467?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192806467)
    by Julian Stallabrass. How contemporary art (world) functions and
    less what it is.
29. [Judaism: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192853902?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192853902)
    by Norman Solomon.
30. **[By Night in
    Chile](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811215474?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0811215474)
    by Roberto Bolano**. Discovered by method of pulling random books
    from shelves in book store. Absolutely superb.
31. **[Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of
    Risk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471295639?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0471295639)
    by Peter L. Bernstein**. A book about history of risk management
    made only more relevant by last financial crisis. Fun and very
    informative.
32. [Forget Kathmandu: An Elegy for
    Democracy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670058122?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0670058122)
    by Manjushree Thapa. Modern history of Nepal told through personal
    experience. Recommended if you are interested in Nepal.
33. **[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy,
    Gentleman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140435050?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140435050)
    by Lawrence Sterne**. Hard to believe that 250 years old novel can
    feel so modern.
34. **[Unseen
    Academicals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061161705?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061161705)
    by Terry Pratchett**. I might be biased, but I would put it among
    his best novels.
35. [Prototyping: A Practitioner's
    Guide](http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/) by Todd
    Zaki Warfel. I never got around writing review of this book.
    Definitely worth a read for practitioners.
36. [Getting Started with
    Arduino](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596155514?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596155514)
    by Massimo Banzi. Aimed at designers, but learned few new things
    anyway.
37. [The City: A Global
    History](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679603360?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0679603360)
    by Joel Kotkin. Sort of a short introduction to history of cities
    with everything good and bad that format entails. Excellent starting
    point for those interested in its subject.

I wish I read as much as Aaron ([latest
review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009)), who seems to devour
about hundred books per year, but I don't think I'll ever manage that.
My goal for this year is going to be about same, 25 books before bells
toll midnight on 31st of December. It still is an ambitious goal, since
these days I seem to have a penchant for buying tomes at least 600 page
thick and want to read more of other people's code.
