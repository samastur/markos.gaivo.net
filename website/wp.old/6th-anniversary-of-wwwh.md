[Web Hours](http://wwwh.si "Events homepage") (spletne urice) is a
series of web related talks that is happening weekly here in Ljubljana
and is free for everyone. [Today's
talk](http://wwwh.si/spletne-urice-181-upravljanje-z-dobrim-imenom/ "Talk topic: reputation management"),
happening on sixth anniversary of [the
first](http://wwwh.si/spletne-urice-1-php-v-oasu-terorizma/ "Topic: PHP in time of terrorism"),
will be 181th. A lot of people shared a lot of knowledge and our
community has grown from a handful coming to first few talks to few tens
of regular attendees. We never made a really serious effort at counting,
but I would be surprised if few talks haven't drawn close to a hundred
people. My congratulations and thanks to all who made it happen!

I started Web Hours on
[Andraž's](http://twitter.com/andraz "Andraž's twitter page") suggestion
because I was not happy with  the quality of work done in Slovenia and I
thought regular web talks could educate and help raise awareness.
Looking back at the state of industry then and where we are now, it is
obvious we came a long way and I'd like to think our talks played a part
in it. I may be biased, but not that much because I stopped organizing
them a long time ago so kudos really goes to [those
who](http://friedcell.net/home "Marko Mrdjenovič - Fry") [followed
me](http://twitter.com/DavorinPavlica "Davorin Pavlica").

It is still easy to find [shoddy
work](http://www.zrkv.si/ "Look at page source if you dare"), but this
will never change. You can find it in any field and there is no reason
why web should be any different. There is always room for growth, but I
am fairly satisfied with Slovenian web development community. These days
there is no shortage of interesting events (meetups, hackdays, camps of
various kinds) where you can meet kindred spirits, many of whom are
doing interesting stuff. I wish there was more open web evangelism, but
talks always were what we made them and it's up to us open web advocates
to go out there more often.

On the other hand Slovenian UX community depresses me. It seems to be
full of people with big egos, very limited knowledge and low self-esteem
resulting in an environment where constructive criticism is avoided and
learning remains personal and, as community, slow. There are exceptions
to this, but right now it seems it is enough to read a couple of books
and follow a few related blogs to justify a UX related title on your
business card and profess expertise. Critical assessment of problems and
approaches is largely missing. There is a difference between cutting
corners and skipping all steps -- being agile is not a justification for
being lazy. Events are rare and online discussions feel limited to
regurgitating blog opinions as facts and discussing eternal, but mostly
answered questions (e.g. how much of underlying technology do
non-developers need to know?).

Then again I may be just an old grump. My feelings about UX community
are not all that different to what I felt about web development
community six years ago and that one turned out OK. Maybe I *am* just
too quick to judge and things will turn out just fine soon enough. We'll
see. See you tonight in [Kiberpipa](http://www.kiberpipa.org/).
