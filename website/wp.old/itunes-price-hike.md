I'm not sure if there's still a custom in our primary schools to go on a
few days long school trip at the end of last year. I know there used to
be one when I was there.

We went to [Vis](http://www.tz-vis.hr/), a small and beautiful island in
Croatia, which back then was still in the same country. It was the end
of May, when sea is still very cold, at least if you're not used to that
sort of temperatures. We weren't and were basically stuck for a few days
in a small village with nothing to do. That was back in the days, when
there was no gameboys, portable DVD's or whatever entertains kids today.
However there was an ice cream parlor, where a scoop of ice cream costed
only 1000 DIN compared to 2500 DIN back home.

So for three days my friends and I were regularly visiting that shop,
buying copious amounts of ice cream. I haven't spent even 1 DIN on it
back home, because I thought it was too expensive. I spent more than 100
000 there, because it was so ridiculously cheap and I wasn't alone doing
it.

Lucky for me I didn't get a bellyache, but I did get a lesson on how
cheaper pricing doesn't necessarily equate smaller profits. Odd that
music industry still
[refuses](http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=145210 "Article about possible iTunes price hike")
to accept this.
