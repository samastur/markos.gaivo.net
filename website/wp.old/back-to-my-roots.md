Title: Back to my roots!

It has dawned on me recently, that I'm not using Linux as much as I used
to. True, all my servers are Linux based and all new code is eventually
deployed on them, but I haven't been using it for a while on a desktop.

Probably the main cause for this was my Powerbook, where practically
everything I create starts its life. It's just so much easier to carry
all your work with you. Linux cause also wasn't helped by a fact, that
my PC is incredibly loud and makes air in office unbreathable in a
matter of minutes.

Mac OS X was never a perfect match for me and I always missed some
things like true network transparency. But lately I became tired of
various software bugs and hardware troubles that plague me and started
to think about Linux more. I also miss being part of open source
community.

So, after this pre-launch mayhem is over, I'll look for a new Linux
machine. It's time to go home.
