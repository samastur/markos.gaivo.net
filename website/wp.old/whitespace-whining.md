There's stuff I agree with, some with which I don't and stuff I simply
don't understand. But what caught my eye was:

Precisely. Yesterday was our regular [web talk
evening](http://web.zen.si/), which is often followed by a lively
debate. As usual we covered all sorts of topics, one of which was
Python. To paraphrase a part of it:

I can't understand how this complaint doesn't die. I can understand that
some other language can tickle their fancy. People have different tastes
and if some people like it rough, who am I to judge. But why in the
world would you wish for a feature you'd never be stupid enough to use?
