I've been neglecting my blog recently. There was no shortage of news,
but somehow I didn't feel like writing. My mind is preoccupied with
other things and where the hell is the cold and wet summer everyone
promised?

Google announced [accessible web
search](http://labs.google.com/accessible/) for the visually impaired. I
see it as a great step in creating an accessible web search for
everyone.

Najdi.si is
[testing](http://zemljevid.najdi.si/?q= "Link to map service") a
slovenian version of Google maps, which obviously can't be more accurate
than its source data, but works very well nevertheless.

But I've been most pleased to discover something else. I gave [a
talk](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=195 "Link to talk announcement")
recently and we spent quite some time discussing AJAX and Javascript
accessibility issues. I wish I knew back then about
[this](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML "Link to accessible DHTML implementation in Firefox 1.5").

Not only is there a draft of a specification for making widgets
accessible, we even got a test environment with Firefox 1.5. I've only
had the time to scan through specification, so my view should be taken
with a big pinch of salt, but my first impression is definitely
positive. We'll see how it develops after I had time to digest it and
make a few tests.
