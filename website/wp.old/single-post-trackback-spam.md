I'm a coeditor of another blog and like most blogs we have some problems
with comment spam (if you're using WordPress, you really ought to give
[akismet](http://akismet.com/ "Spam prevention for WordPress") a go). In
general I don't mind it too much and take it as a price of
self-expression.

But we get spam that drives me nuts, because it's something that could
be permanently fixed. You see, ALL of our trackback spam is directed to
the same blog post. So, if I could turn trackback off only on that post,
it would cut our spam to more than a half and leave my nerves intact.

I don't think it's doable with default installation of WordPress 1.5,
but if any of you is using a plugin that support this functionality, I'd
appreciate it greatly if you could let me know.
