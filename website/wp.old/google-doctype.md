While I was busy this week Google released
[Doctype](http://code.google.com/doctype/ "Link to Google Doctype website").
The good thing about being late to a web party is that someone somewhere
is bound to save you work of expressing yourself by presenting same
impressions in a way you couldn't. John Resig [did
it](http://ejohn.org/blog/google-doctype/) for me this time.
