Quirksmode blog has announced [the
winner](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/10/_and_the_winner.html)
of addEvent competition. Announcement was immediately followed by a
lively discussion and it seems javascript community is not persuaded.
Neither am I.

I'm not happy with the code I'm using right now and I was hoping to
replace it with the winner. However, I do believe there are real
problems with winning entry, so I won't be using it quite yet.
