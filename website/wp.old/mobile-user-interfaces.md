I've been working on Marela uploader for series60 phones (those with
Python support) and have had a great fun discovering the world of user
interfaces on mobile devices.

If you think there's not enough space on your average web page, you
really should try designing an interface for a device with stamp size
screen with a resolution of [Commodore 64](http://www.c64.com/) in full
color mode (but luckily with far more colors) and input device that only
kids could love. On top of that there's a limited selection of existing
UI controls to chose from and text can't be too small to remain legible.

Still, I think the major problems have been solved and I'm maybe a day
or so of development and a decent camera phone away from first working
version. I'm hoping to get it done by this weekend, but realist in me
keeps screaming: "Maybe next week!"
