I really dislike headaches and although I don't get them as often as I
used to, they are usually not as easy to shake of. That's why we have
several different pills in our home to battle this nuisance. I recently
noticed that one of them, Plivadon, has its name stamped in Braille on
the box (click for a bigger picture):

It's great that [Pliva](http://www.pliva.com/) (Plivadon's maker) makes
its product more accessible to blind people. At the same time, this is
also a good example of how difficult good accessibility is.

It's a common misconception that all blind people either know how to
read Braille or can learn how to. In fact, a large part if not majority
of them don't and can't. The reason for this is that you can learn
Braille only if tips of your fingers are sensitive enough and that's
usually the case only for those who were born blind or became blind in
their youth.

But blindness can be caused by an accident later in life or by various
diseases like diabetes, which means it's far more common among older
people, who through years of working with hands lost the necessary
sensitivity in their fingers. They are in such cases forced to cope with
their usual methods such as being very organized about where they put
things.

Pliva (and other companies) could help them more. They could make the
shape and size of the box more unique. They could stamp an easily
recognizable pattern on parts of the box, just like they did with
Braille. Anything that can make the tactile feedback more unique would
probably help.^[1](#pliva-2006-06-05)<a name="pliva1-2006-06-06"></a>^

Alas they, as more often than not we, don't do what they easily could.

Notes:

1.  <a name="pliva-2006-06-05"></a>Braille sign on Plivadon's box is
    distinguishing enough mark for as long as there isn't a similarly
    sized box and a sign at the approximately same position.
