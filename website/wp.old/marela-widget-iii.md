Summer is closing to the end, so is my
[offer](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=199) and I won't be posting new
widgets for a while. This last one, stemming from obviously borrowed
idea, looks like this:

<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/random16.js?username=markos&amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;time=3"></script>
</p>
It's still very small (less than 7K) and still works in all major
browsers. It even works (without a problem) in Safari and image
selection collision code works too. If you like it, you can add it to
your own page with:

` <script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/random16.js?username=markos&tag=moja-izbira&time=3"></script>`

You should, as previously, replace:

-   my username (markos) with yours
-   select a tag of your chosing
-   set time lag in seconds between image replacements

As always you're free to copy the script or link to my page to use the
latest version.
