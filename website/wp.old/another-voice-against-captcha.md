I tried to leave a comment on [Digg](http://www.digg.com/) recently and
had trouble deciphering its
[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha). I was eventually
successful, but only after I got annoyed. Simply put, CAPTCHAs are evil.

There's no need to rehash why, since
[plenty](http://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+accessibility) has been
said so far. They [don't](http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/) really work
and they [exclude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Accessibility)
lots of people even if you do use an alternative audio check. As a
left-handed person, who curses every time he picks up an "ergonomically"
designed scissors, I kind of imagine how it is when things are designed
for a majority you don't belong to.

However, even if you could make them completely accessible (doubtful)
and would somehow be able to resolve the overlap between smartest
programs and, well, less-gifted humans (impossible), I'd still dislike
them. What they say to your readers is: "I'll make you work so I don't
have to."

Is this the message you want to communicate?

P.S: WordPress users, you really ought to take a look at
[Akismet](http://akismet.com/), if you haven't done so.
