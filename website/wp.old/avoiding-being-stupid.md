Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t
do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty
conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of
updating and polishing them later.

I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote
full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to [set things
right](http://xkcd.com/386/). No doubt I can still display both of these
“virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few
psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible,
concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking
questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and
what is driving my response. I've been compiling questions and this is
what I have so far:

*Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit
me?*  
You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this
when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are^<span

*How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some
other group B?*  
Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger
instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are
reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?

*Why am I trying to say this?*  
Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid
voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to
speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also
the source of biases.

*Is it a matter of a principle or degree?*  
I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are
judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the
problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine
conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those
conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I
disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of
which can lead to new insight^<span
id="avoid-stupid-2">[[2]](#avoid-stupid-2-note)</span>.^

*Can I be persuaded?*  
I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I
can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my
view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop
since I am not having a dialog.

I don't always run through all these questions, but I'm sure I'm not the
only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I
plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.

    Or as Upton Sinclair put it: “It is difficult to get a man to
    understand something, when his salary depends on his not
    understanding it.” [↩](#avoid-stupid-1)

    Example: unrealistic view of humanity makes communism and
    libertarianism equally absurd. [↩](#avoid-stupid-2)
