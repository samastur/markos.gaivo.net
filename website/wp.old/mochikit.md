Sometimes I'm really glad my brains don't let my mouth shoot off as
quickly as it would like.

I was checking latest versions of
[Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/),
[Dojo](http://www.dojotoolkit.org/) and
[MochiKit](http://www.mochikit.com/) a couple of days ago and while I
liked the first two, I had a much lower opinion of the third. In fact, I
couldn't understand why [Turbogears](http://www.turbogears.org/) has
chosen MochiKit as its AJAX library and was about to write a post
questioning just that.

I'm glad I didn't. MochiKit still wouldn't be my choice and probably
won't be when I'll start using existing libraries instead of mine, but
that doesn't make it a bad choice. A lot of thought and effort has been
put into its implementation and it shows.

There are obviously things I dislike about it and the major one being
the way it loads dependencies. I despise document.write and I disagree
with argument made in comments (Safari's use of defer on generated
scripts). But I guess this is something reasonable minds can disagree
on.
