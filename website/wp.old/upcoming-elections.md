I never intended to, but somehow missed last few elections because they
were on dates when we were travelling. It looks like this time will be
different so we have spent quite some time so far thinking about whom to
give our votes. Like most people I know I find most parties in Slovenia
distasteful and while I am not enamoured by anyone, I think I will be
able to cast a vote. But I do wish our system was slightly different.

Here's what I would change if I could:

1.  *Introduce a [preferential
    vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_voting "Preferential voting")*
    (only first and second choice). It kind of sucks that you have to
    decide between a party that you would like to vote for and a party
    that actually has a chance of getting in parliament according to
    polls. I know I am not alone with this dilemma and I often wonder
    who people would pick if they were not afraid of "wasting" their
    vote.
2.  *[Compulsory
    voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting "Compulsory voting")*
    (but only with point 3). Everyone who can vote really should unless
    they can provide a good reason why they can't. Voting every few
    years really should be the bare minimum of citizen's civic
    engagement.
3.  *Add an explicit choice "Nobody from this list".* Voting for least
    awful can still be unpalatable. Right now we also can't distinguish
    between people who didn't want to vote for anyone on the ballot and
    those who couldn't be bothered. It's easy to see low turnouts as a
    failure of democratic process when it has less to do with process
    and more with available choices. "Nobody" votes should be counted
    when calculating parliamentary threshold since they are votes
    against all parties, and ignored when calculating how many seats
    parties in parliament get.

Regretfully these changes wouldn't benefit parties in parliament
(whichever they are or will be) so there isÂ  almost a zero chance that
above changes will happen. Unless of course there is enough popular
support to have a referendum.
