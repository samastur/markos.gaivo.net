I'm writing this post 10 or 11, depending on how you count, days A.i.
(after iPhone). Phone-phobic heathen that I am, I would prefer to have
an [open, very hackable](http://www.openmoko.org/), [mobile
computer](http://www.openmoko.com/), which is also a phone, than the
other way around.

Alas, there's no point in purchase when there is no free time to do the
hacking.

No free time also means forgetting self-imposed deadline for rewriting
this blog and having to put up with it for quite some time longer. That
is, if there will also be enough time to do some writing. For better or
worse I am not giving up hope on that yet.

Hopefully some of my ideas will crop up in what I am secretly doing at
work right now even if it won't be really what I wanted to do in the
first place. It won't be worse, just different.

Anyway, with this I fulfilled my quota of at least a post per month for
July. Have a great summer.
