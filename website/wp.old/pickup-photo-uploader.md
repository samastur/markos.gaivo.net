If you're both, a Marela and Firefox 1.5 user, then you should really
take a look at [Pickup](http://brian.kingsonline.net/talk/?p=185).
[Brian](http://brian.kingsonline.net) has, with help of others,
developed an excellent
[uploader](http://briks.si/projekti/pickup/ "Link to Pickup uploader project page")
for multiple photo services including Marela.

Extension has been translated to Slovene, but you need either a
translated version of Firefox or an installed [language
pack](ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.4/win32/xpi)
together with a [language](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1333/)
[switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/356/).

My thanks go to all who helped making photo uploading less painful.
