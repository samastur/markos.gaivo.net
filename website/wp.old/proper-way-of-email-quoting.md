I was reading Roger Johansson's blog and came to a
[post](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/)
about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I
observed a flamewar between
[top-posting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting) and
inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:

I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more
often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and
I don't think I'm a lesser being for it.
