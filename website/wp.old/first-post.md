This is a first post on my new development oriented blog.

I returned from @media2005 yesterday, where I got the feeling that
either you have a blog on which you share your thoughts and possible
insights or you have no good way to join the discussion except few times
a year on conferences like the last one, which certainly can't be and
isn't enough.

Therefore I decided to make a new start, this time in English and about
subjects where I might have a bit more interesting things to say than
what happened to my non-existant cat.

So, welcome to anyone who happened to come to this place and I hope
you'll find it at least mildly useful, if not entertaining.
