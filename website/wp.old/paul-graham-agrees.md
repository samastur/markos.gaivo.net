Paul Graham has written another
[essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html "Link to essay") on what
Web 2.0 actually means. I hate being a "me too", but we seem to share
disgust of terms Web 2.0 and AJAX and agree that Wikipedia is faulty but
good enough. Worth a read, but my favorite stays [the
same](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html "What you can't say").
