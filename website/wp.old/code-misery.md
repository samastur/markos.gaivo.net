I appreciate efforts by
[Zvone](http://www.vecer.si/blog/zvone "Zvone's blog") in trying to
build the best slovenian blogging platform. I really do. Although it
might be better than others, the technical implementation is still very
poor.

A new season of web talks (Spletne Urice) will start in month and a half
and one of the ideas contemplated was to publish regular column, where
common development mistakes would get dissected and possible solutions
would also be shown. I'm more or less convinced that there's a real need
for it.

This is not about technical puritanism of following standards for their
own sake. I've discovered this last transgression trying to find out why
I couldn't post a comment while others obviously could. What I found was
Javascript code that looked like this:

<codeins ="vecerjscrap"></codeins>

Now, this has nothing to do with my problem. But it's still an atrocious
code that should be put out of its misery as soon as possible.
Javascript does have loops, which come in forms familiar to users of
most modern programming languages.

It's also a remarkably poor spam filter which can work only as long as
spammers don't put any effort into averting it.

If this is the state of slovenian web development, and it is, even when
lots of good work done so far has been considered, it's clear why more
work should be done in educating developers of how and why they should
change their practices. I'm sure most of them don't produce crap like
this purposefully.
