Title: Searching for an Atom feed generator

I'm still mostly offline, but luckily UMTS offers a sort of solution. It
works alright, but it is fairly expensive and I'm counting my bytes
again. Still better than helplessly and hopelessly waiting for local
telecom to fix ADSL, which judging by previous experience may happen who
knows when.

I've been looking for an Atom feed generator and I can't find anything
more than a few exploratory hacks. Is there something out there that
would at least resemble
[PyRSS2Gen](http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html "Link to PyRSS2Gen's homepage")?

What I'd like is something that returns a proper Atom 1.0 feed and
doesn't choke on non-ascii using languages. I'm sure I'm missing
something. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
