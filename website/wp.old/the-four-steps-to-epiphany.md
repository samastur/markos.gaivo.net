I seem to have mentioned books I've been reading a lot in last few
posts, but this is the first time I am writing a post solely dedicated
to a book. [The Four Steps to the
Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705?ie=UTF8&tag=devel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976470705)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0976470705)
by Steven Gary Blank is a book I heard recommended a few times before
[Eric Ries](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/ "Eric's blog")
recommendation during his talk persuaded me, but I bought it mainly
because it bothered me that most projects I was involved with relied
heavily on intuition and it just seemed that there has to be a better
way to expose and test assumptions made during project lifetime.

To a typography nut like me this book looks, well, horrible. I suspect
Cafepress' print-on-demand system has also something to do with it, but
this is not its only fault. There are plenty of typos and glitches such
as whole chapter 4 carrying a footer of chapter 3. Occasionally you can
find grammar errors even someone like me can be sure of. In short, the
book also looks like it wasn't made by experienced publisher.

Having said all that, if you are thinking of starting a business venture
or really any project where you and people precisely like you are not
the only target market, you should BUY AND READ THIS BOOK. It costs 40\$
on Amazon, but I wouldn't hesitate recommending it even if it cost ten
times as much. For those who might doubt veracity of recommendation on
account of my Amazon Affiliate link, [here
is](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705 "Non-affiliated link to book")
also a non-affiliated link that gains me nothing. Or you can save some
more by following link on [Steve's blog](http://steveblank.com/) (which
is a good read too).

Unlike most business books I read or browsed, it isn't a 2-300 hundred
page long discourse about a couple of ideas that could be adequately
explained and argued in tenth of its length. It's a textbook about
Customer Development, a different way of organizing and building a
company from startup to established company. This is done methodically,
each step building on previous where every assumption is tested while it
is still relatively cheap to do so. First 200 pages might occasionally
contain a short story that proves a point, but are otherwise filled with
very concrete advice on what needs to be done and how you can or should
go about it. If that wasn't enough, you also get a Custom Development
Checklist (taking a quarter of the book) which you can use to check that
nothing was left out.

I suspect not many startups follow every step as prescribed, but even if
you don't or disagree with most of it, I can't imagine how you wouldn't
profit from reading it. So just go and buy it. You won't be able to make
notes in borrowed copy.
