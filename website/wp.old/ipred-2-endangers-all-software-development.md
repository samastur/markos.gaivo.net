[FSF Europe](http://www.fsfeurope.org) has prepared a [short
document](http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/ipred2.en.html)
describing problems with IPRED2, the new "Intellectual Property" rights
directive from European Union. If passed, it could lead to jail
sentences for intellectual property violators. Proposal doesn't
distinguish between kinds of intellectual property, but it does limit
itself to sadly undefined willful infringement.

Not being a lawyer makes it hard to judge, if FSF's objections are
valid. According to [a report](http://wiki.ffii.de/IpredEp051122En) from
FFII, big IP companies are not happy with it either. Directive's
proposal certainly leaves a lot to interpretation and FSF's scenario
doesn't seem far fetched. Especially for those of us who've seen how
difficult it can be for lawyers to agree on anything.

In short, it's another piece of ill-considered legislation that wants to
help entertainment industry in their fight against reality at the
expense of almost everyone else.

I wonder if someday people will look at IP legislation of late 20th and
early 21st century the way we see now tax on windows (not to be confused
with windows tax, which opens gates to completely different discussion).
