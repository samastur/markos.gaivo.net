I finally got a new machine yesterday and I immediately installed SuSE
10 on it. Ubuntu seems to be the flavor of the moment, but I was never
much fond of Debian and even less of GNOME.

So far I really like the experience, the only exception being a problem
with a keyboard. For some unknown reason my old PS/2 keyboard doesn't
get recognized in Linux and therefore simply doesn't work.

It's the first time in almost a decade of being a Linux user to
experience something like this and I have no idea what could cause this
and how to fix it. Google hasn't helped either, so if anyone has any
idea about this, I'd be immensely grateful if you could share it.

I'm using an USB keyboard for now, which works. Well, sort of. It seems
to be impossible to buy a decent USB keyboard in Slovenia so I'm stuck
with
[this](http://www.trust.com/products/product.aspx?artnr=14211 "Link to keyboard's page")
piece of crap for now. Truth be told, this was just the cheapest of bad
options.
