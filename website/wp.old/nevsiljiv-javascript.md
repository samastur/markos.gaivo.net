It seems only appropriate to use this place to announce a talk I'm
giving tomorrow at 19:00 at [Kiberpipa](http://www.kiberpipa.org).

I'll be talking about degradable javascript and its benefits and the
talk should be accessible to all, even javascript newbies. Just to clear
any misconceptions, degradable AJAX will be demonstrated, but the point
of talk is general javascript use and misuse and not the latest
fashionable tricks.

The talk will be given in Slovene unless there's a wide enough interest
to give it in English. I hope you'll come and stay for a chat and a
drink.

See you there.
