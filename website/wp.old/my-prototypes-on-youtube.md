I am not much of a [YouTube
user](http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur "My YouTube channel"), but I
have recently started to upload some of my work
[there](http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur "my demos on youtube").
You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes
for products that may never be (especially if you are a
[Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com "Zemanta") user).

I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement
and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be
actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to
our users so please tell us what you think.

This is also a good time to mention that I don't lead front-end team at
Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy
way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our
users more deeply than anybody else.
