I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite
smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a
long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was
secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that
has stopped working, please let me know.

I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn
rich-text editing on. It's hard to imagine that it simply doesn't exist.
