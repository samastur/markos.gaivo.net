[Firefox 3](http://www.firefox.com/ "Mozilla Firefox") was released last
week and tomorrow, a week after its release, we'll have [a release
party](http://www.kiberpipa.org/firefox/) at Kiberpipa. Everybody is
welcome, but you have to register first.

Part of the event will be [a series of
talks](http://www.kiberpipa.org/firefox/schedule), one of which will be
mine, a short talk titled Easy deployment of site-extensions with a
[browser plugin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugin "Plugin").

I hope to see you there.
