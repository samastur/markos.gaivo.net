    <strong>
     Update 2:
    </strong>
    Tickets are now
    <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">
     on sale
    </a>
    and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Update
    </strong>
    : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no good way of contacting organizers
    <sup>
     <a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1">
      [1]
     </a>
    </sup>
    and not much travel information either on
    <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">
     the DjangoCon’s website
    </a>
    or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
   </p>
   <p>
    First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
   </p>
   <p>
    It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
    <strong>
     er
    </strong>
    , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
   </p>
   <p>
    No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
   </p>
   <p>
    In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
   </p>
   <p>
    I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.
