        <div class="post-text">
            <p>It's been a week with a lot of novelty. I got a new monitor, a nice 21"
LCD and it seemed appropriate to install a more recent, so to speak new,
Linux distribution to go with it. I decided for Kubuntu and so far I
quite like it.</p>
<p>I've been a Linux user for more than a decade, but for last few years I
haven't really used my machine for everyday browsing. One reason were
bookmarks accumulated in my powerbook and the other absence of Flash
plugin for x86-64 platform. Flash plugin is still missing, but clever
folks contrived a way to use the i386 one. Basically you install
compatibility libraries and another, 32 bit version of Firefox.</p>
<p>Still, I mostly use the one without a plugin and so far it has certainly
been an eye opening experience. Once upon a time sites fell in two
categories, those made more or less completely with Flash and others,
which didn't use it at all. I have no idea when this changed, but it's
certainly not true anymore. These days most sites seem to be combination
of both approaches.</p>
<p>As with Javascript it can work quite nicely when used sensibly and in an
unobtrusive way. However, there are lots of sites like
<a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/">this</a>, which you simply can't use
without Flash. With proliferation of video and widgets, that play ever
more important roles, I feel that web is becoming less open with every
day.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn't mind that much if Flash player itself was open (I
don't really care about development tools). Well, when all else fails,
you can always hope.</p>
