        <div class="post-text">
            <p>Quite a lot has happened during time when I was away from this blog and
I'll probably talk about some of it in next few days, but I'd like to
start with news from Google.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=14">badly written post</a> when
Google Talk was unveiled. What bothered me most was the fact that it
didn't communicate with anybody and was in fact another walled garden.</p>
<p>Well, they <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html" title="Open federation announcement">fixed
it</a>
and Google Talk now actually talks to other jabber servers including
ours.</p>
<p>There are some problems with presence notification, but it's hard to say
yet who's fault it is and I wouldn't be surprised if it was ours. Sad
thing about jabber is that there are few if any open source server
implementations that wouldn't be just a notch above suck.</p>
<p>In short run this won't change much. Most people will still be on
competing services and it might be difficult to get them off. But as a
newborn optimist I see a promise of an open, working IM, where you're
not tied to wishes and development of one company even when that company
is mine. And that can only be good.</p>
