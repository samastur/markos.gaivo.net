            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>December is running out of days fast and I still haven't written my
annual review of things I planned or did, intentionally or otherwise.
I've been thinking about it for a while, but couldn't find words to
express myself. Finally I gave up. I don't think I'll succeed now, but I
doubt more time would help.</p>
<p>For me this year has been absolutely wonderful. Coming to
<a href="http://www.zemanta.com" title="Zemanta">Zemanta</a> meant I could work on
interesting problems to improve a tool I use myself while collaborating
with people I like and respect. I traveled to more conferences than ever
before and generally learned a lot. I'm proud of my team's achievements
and of what we did as a company. It is indeed a privilege to have a gig
like this.</p>
<p>I've also started a private project with a friend, which is coming along
nicely. It shouldn't be too long before we can show it to, well,
everyone interested. Hopefully that means to many.</p>
<p>In all, 2008 was great for me and I don't think 2009 will be worse.</p>
<p>Yet of late I've been feeling increasingly gloomy. This has remarkably
little to do with economic crisis, influence of which we can already
feel even if it's yet to hit with full force. I won't be traveling as
much next year, but I planned to do less of it even before I knew there
might be economic reasons to do so.</p>
<p>I've been worrying about the state of our planet for years. Things
weren't getting better as quickly as I thought they should. In fact,
they aren't getting better at all, but I hoped we would turn and do what
needs to be done when given last chance.</p>
<p>There are many things that are deeply wrong in this world. Slavery <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/slavery-worse-than-ever">is
more widespread</a>
than probably ever. We know we should reduce the amount of CO~2~ in
atmosphere, yet <a href="http://www.mnp.nl/en/publications/2008/GlobalCO2emissionsthrough2007.html">we do
opposite</a>.
Fisheries around world are rapidly
<a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0918-hance_fish.html">collapsing</a> taking
whole ecosystems with them. Glaciers <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/10/poznan-brazil-climate-change-environment">are
receding</a>
with probably disastrous effect on water supplies for millions of
people. Rising world population will continue to negate any progress we
may have. I <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7780040.stm">could go
on</a>, but this list is
depressing enough.</p>
<p>After all it's not the scale or number of challenges that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7786910.stm">is
dispiriting</a>.
It's our <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/12/greenpolitics-poznan">inability to
act</a>
decisively. We prefer compromises that set targets too low and then
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2008/12/when_targets_miss_the_point.html">fail to
meet</a>
them. There are 6.5 billion of us, but we are still unable to face real
probability that this may be too many. I sometimes wonder how lives
looked like in last days of civilizations long gone, most of them
disappearing precisely because they taxed their environment too much. I
hope I'm wrong and never find out.</p>
<p>I wished to end this post on a positive note, but I'm clearly failing. I
do sincerely wish everyone happy holidays and the best of luck in next
year. I'm afraid we'll need it.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I use <a href="http://gmail.com" title="Gmail">Gmail</a> mainly for reading mailing
lists. I'm old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control
it, but otherwise I can't fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better
and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on
Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can't). Go to the Lab tab in
settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type
is:unread in search box and confirm.</p>
<p>When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links
widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists
unread messages. It's not perfect though. It won't show you how many
messages are unread and you can't subscribe to it through
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</a>.</p>
<p>The other thing that is not perfect is <a href="http://docs.google.com/" title="Google Docs">Google
Docs</a>, which I quite like. I did
encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I
imagine it might be in not too distant future.</p>
<p>How do you move documents between accounts?</p>
<p>What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to
and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a
pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it
seems I can't transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is
not only not obvious, but also doesn't work all the time.</p>
<p>If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would
love to hear them.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems part of my post <a href="http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2008/12/labs-love-at-last" title="Labs for Google Apps">became
untrue</a>
even faster than usual.</p>
