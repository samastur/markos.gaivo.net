            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/" title="John's homepage">John
Lily</a> why haven't they
integrated <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/" title="Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a>
into <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" title="Firefox">Firefox</a>. Wrong
question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know
was:</p>
<p><em>"Why doesn't <a href="http://mozilla.com" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> integrate
Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?"</em></p>
<p>Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It's them who decide
how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be
able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page
designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit
with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.</p>
<p>Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone's computer and
belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in
EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of
them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)Â 
to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:</p>
<p><em>"To whom does a browser belong to?"</em></p>
<p>One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and
change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it
should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small
letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is
indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation
doesn't need to be. I find <a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">Platypus
extension</a> a good first step to how a
browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even
further to their needs.</p>
<p>I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I'm failing to find
anything substantial.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>As could be expected, I wasn't the first one who thought about
controlling spiders more granularly. Even though I prefer deny-allow
idea that <a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> and I came up
with after a lively debate yesterday, I think <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/robots-exclusion" title="Link to format specification">Robot Exclusion
Profile</a>
(REP) microformat is not a bad start. Actually, it's quite good with a
few open <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/robots-exclusion#Issues">issues</a>
that mostly shouldn't be too difficult to resolve.</p>
<h4>Precedence</h4>
<p>I don't think it matters what policy you have when dealing with
conflicting classes set on the same element, as long as you choose one.
Personally, I'd mimic CSS way and go for last definition stays. So
<em>class="robots-nofollow robots-follow"</em> would be equal to
<em>class="robots-follow"</em>. I'd say the same order precedence also should
stand in <em>class="robots-follow" rel="nofollow"</em> case.</p>
<p>Toolkits might have a problem with this approach, since you often can't
tell in which order were attributes set. If this is deemed important,
then I think a reasonable approach in case of conflict is to simply
ignore <strong>all</strong> exclusion attributes.</p>
<p>However, I think there's another ambiguity that hasn't been mentioned.
What should a spider do, if it encounters something like this:<br />
<codeins ="robots-exclusion"></codeins></p>
<p>It's a valid scenario. Imagine your average blog sidebar, which includes
navigational items like archives that probably don't belong in index,
but can also include stuff like current post categories, which should.</p>
<p>I think specification heavily implies CSS approach to this (the most
specific value wins) and that spider should process all elements, even
those included inside of parts that might later get ignored. Still, it
would be nice if this was explicitly written.</p>
<h4>Specificity</h4>
<p>I simply don't care. Even without control of specific UA it's clearly a
superset of today's behavior. It doesn't remove anything. It only adds
control and in a way, where default behavior is today's behavior. So it
could hardly be less intrusive.</p>
<p>I also think proposed solution for the problem is good enough, but we
could add this later on, if needed.</p>
<h4>Suitability as a microformat</h4>
<p>Well, this is the though one. I don't think there's much if any
difference between
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/relnofollow">relnofollow</a> and this
specification (REP being really only a moderate extension of
relnofollow). In both cases human's don't really come first before
computers or at least not directly. In both cases you want to influence
search engines to produce better search results, which consequently
helps humans.</p>
<p>I see myself as a technological pragmatist so I care more about the end
result then sticking to some high ideal. If it's accepted that
controlling spider behavior would be beneficial and I see no opposition
to this idea, then it seems obvious that a reasonable end product
(specification) will look a lot like a defined microformat.</p>
<p>So is the problem really only in daring to call it a microformat and
sticking it on a microformats website?</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>A few days ago I came to
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=146">recognize</a> that email hiding
technique I use won't work anymore. However I still think it would be a
great idea if I could remove a part of a page from search index, even if
it won't help me hide from spammers in the long run.</p>
<p>What I'd really like is to specify which parts of a page are not its
content and can be safely ignored by search engines. Ignoring it would
also mean absence of those parts from search indexes. Spiders could
still follow links inside those parts, because I can still use
<em>robots.txt</em> file if I really want to block their traversal. In effect,
I'd like a more fine-grained approach to blocking, which doesn't force
the layout of my pages to even slightly favor spiders over people.</p>
<p>The way I imagine it would work is by simply applying a class name to
the parts of the page I'd want shielded. I don't care much (yet) if such
class name would need to be specified in robots file or if it would be
some name achieved by a web consensus. As far as I can see both
approaches would work equally well.</p>
<p>The benefit of this would also be better search results. Every now and
then I follow a search hit that fit my query because of a combination of
site content and its navigation. Judging by my logs I'm not the only
deceived soul. So, wouldn't it be nice to be able to tell which parts
are content and which aren't?</p>
