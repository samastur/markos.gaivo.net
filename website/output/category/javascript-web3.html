            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>It's an expected fact of a geek life that interesting technologies and
gadgets appear when you don't have either means or time to play with
them. No surprise then that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html">Google
Gears</a> was announced
exactly at such a time for me. As you've probably read elsewhere, Google
Gears is a browser extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer (with
Safari coming up) which lets developers create web applications that can
also run offline on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Google isn't the first company doing something like this. Adobe has
Apollo, Microsoft is working on its own thing, Mozilla added support for
offline storage in version 2 of the fox and there are some less well
known attempts like Dojo's. What makes it special are few things.</p>
<p>First, unlike Apollo or Firefox, it's not a special environment and it's
as cross-browser and cross-platform as it gets these days. Google is
also trying to build an industry support for this and Adobe already
<a href="http://shebanation.com/2007/05/30/google-gears/">announced</a> it will
support Gears API in Apollo. Same has <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/audible-ajax-episode-21-dojo-offline-on-google-gears">already been
done</a>
by Dojo Toolkit. There's also <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/05/30/19.06.10/#comments">an
intention</a>
to make it an open standard by submitting proposal to WHATWG/W3C (and
hopefully them accepting it).</p>
<p>Personally, I can't wait to play with WorkerPool API (which seems to be
overlooked in all the excitement). Having a possibility of running
time-intensive operations in a background without the fear of triggering
"unresponsive script" dialog is a wish come true. Even though you can't
access objects <em>document</em> and <em>window</em> (and hence any part of the DOM).
Reason for this is that background scripts don't share any execution
state and hence can't all access unique objects like aforementioned
ones.</p>
<p>This might limit usefulness of the API somewhat, but there are still
plenty of uses that come to my mind. What also comes to my mind is a
problem, that isn't really technological. Web applications gave
impression to public of being fairly safe to use even on public
computers (which isn't really true) and I fear many won't understand
that new tools may now store private data where they don't expect or
want them to.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/problem-with-public-javascript-hosting.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Problem with public javascript hosting">Problem with public javascript hosting</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Yahoo recently
<a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/02/22/free-yui-hosting/">announced</a> free
public hosting of YUI library, just like AOL
<a href="http://blog.dojotoolkit.org/2006/01/30/dojo-iamalpha-and-cdns">did</a> a
while ago for Dojo toolkit. A great move. You don't have to pay
bandwidth for hosting YUI and there's a better likelihood that scripts
will already be in visitors browser cache, since some other previously
visited page might have used them too.</p>
<p>However there's a real downside to it. What happens if Yahoo servers are
unaccessible or connection to them is just slow?</p>
<p>If you're lucky, then its former and the page will be rendered quickly
but with some (javascript) functionality missing. If later, then it
might take forever to render a page since modern browsers can't and
won't do it until all javascript has been loaded.</p>
<p>This might seem an unlikely scenario, unless you've been around the last
time when access problems to Google Analytics stopped displaying a large
part of slovenian web, least important of which being this very blog.
Yahoo is not stupid, but neither is Google and problem can literally
appear anywhere between their servers and your visitors computer.</p>
<p>So what can be done if this possibility is not acceptable to you, but
you'd still want to use free hosting?</p>
<p>Nothing pretty it seems. The only thing that I can think of is to add
local links to yui, put them together with Yahoo links at the bottom of
the page and trigger Javascript when content has been loaded. Then you
only have to wait for YUI objects to appear before you start processing
your scripts.</p>
<p>This way you can probably avoid crippled or blank pages, but you're
still paying for the bandwidth. Unless of course you go one step further
and include local links only when Yahoo objects don't appear in a
reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how to solve this problem gracefully?</p>
