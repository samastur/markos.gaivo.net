                <p>Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I
discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name
correctly. I've experienced it so many times by now that I find it
neither surprising nor annoying.</p>
<p>This week was a bit special with higher frequency of errors than usual
on account of my talk. First I became Marko Semastur. Then a day or so
later Makro Samastur was in vogue, which it'll remain to be until the
subtitles on footage are changed. I find the tech
<a href="http://www.insultmonger.com/swearing/mauritius.htm">pimp</a> connotation
of Makro highly amusing, but not quite a T-shirt material.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend yesterday who'd like to put up a website
displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is
already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can't
say I persuaded even myself.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is how important do you think is your name or the
name you choose for a company for your recognition and success?</p>
<p>I've been going back and forth over this and I can't say I'm any wiser.</p>
