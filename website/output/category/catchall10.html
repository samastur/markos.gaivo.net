            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>It's been six months since I wrote <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=310">my gloomy
outlook</a> and unlike most things I
wrote, my thoughts keep coming back to it and issues I talked about. My
view hasn't changed. 2009 is indeed shaping to be a great year for me
and an awful one for world in general.</p>
<p>If a problem like over-fishing, that is both well-understood and has
known and relatively cheap solutions, seems to be beyond our willingness
to solve, what chance do we have then to find and implement solutions
for problems that require enormously more effort and resources?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ugotrade.com/2009/02/27/towards-a-newer-urbanism-talking-cities-networks-and-publics-with-adam-greenfield/" title="Adam Greenfield says it's game over.">Game
over</a>
indeed.</p>
<p>I don't see our civilization surviving this century even if no giant
rock crosses our path. There are many reasons for this, but none
original or interesting enough to dwell upon. At the same time I do
think this is not the last century in which humans live.</p>
<p>If we are all indeed descendants of a tribe that at some point numbered
only 2000 individuals, as I've heard in a lecture once, then it doesn't
take much to imagine that out of billions enough people will survive to
continue our species existence. Not even me imagines a world completely
void of water, plants or small furry animals.</p>
<p>Alas civilization needs more than mere presence of humans. Inspired by
Irish post-Roman example a question occured to me recently: <em>"Which 100
books would you try to preserve if you wanted to preserve our
civilization?"</em></p>
<p>Point being that if things go the way of Dodo and people have to fight
for survival, it wouldn't be reasonable to expect enlightened person or
small groups to preserve many more books than that. And books are still
the best way to preserve knowledge in long term. Other forms are either
too transient or can pack information far less densely.</p>
<p>I quickly realized two things. First, that I have no clue which books I
would pick. And second, that there are more fundamental questions.</p>
<p><em>Can a civilization fluidly metamorphose from failing to a new, thriving
and likely different civilization or does the new one need to start anew
from ashes of previous ones?</em></p>
<p>Question matters, because I imagine that civilizations are in a way like
companies. Establishing one is quite different than keeping one going
and hence knowledge needed is probably different too. Most historical
examples I know of persuaded me that scale of a problem and length of
time before its full consequences are felt are inversely proportional to
likelihood of our dealing with it before it is too late. However I am
not a historian and could well be wrong. Still, you do with what you
have and this seems reasonable enough assumption for further inspection.</p>
<p>Assuming this, <em>what does it take to establish a civilization?</em></p>
<p>One thing that comes to mind is a high enough density of people who
don't spend all of their time procuring food. This means they can't be
hunter gatherers and some agricultural knowledge needs to survive to
successfully plant and grow existing crops or tame new ones.</p>
<p>It would also be helpful if all technological knowledge isn't lost
either. Electrical gadgets will be hopelessly obsolete, but creating and
fixing a good plow or knowing how to preserve perishable goods for
longer periods of time will not be something to sneeze at. World might
be full of decrepit remains that might be reused, but there is no good
reason to leave it just to human ingenuity to discover how and to what
purpose.</p>
<p>Another way to increase number of people living is to stop them dying
needlessly. Hence preservation of most effective ways to stay healthy
and low tech remedies for most common diseases and injuries would be
helpful too. Most drugs will be gone for centuries, but it's remarkable
how much can be achieved with what will hopefully still be found in
nature.</p>
<p>Mathematics is also an underpreciated, yet necessary underpinning of
every developed civilization. Calculus will not be needed from the
get-go, but just counting doesn't get you far either. There's hardly a
plan that couldn't be improved with a sensible application of
mathematics. Related to this, basic economics should be preserved too.</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as society," said Margaret Thatcher, which of
course is rubish and why it is not enough to learn how to live in
complex social structures, but also why and in what ways. Therefore
sociological and philosophical texts should also make cut. I find it
difficult to imagine titles, because I don't think culture is something
you can implant. It is nurtured and developed not only by circumstances
and challenges society faces, but also with choices it makes. It is
unlikely that next round would follow our footsteps but optimist in me
would love to leave something that inspires and gives something to
aspire to.</p>
<p>All these knowledge would be dead ink on paper if person holding a book
doesn't know how to read or what words actually mean. So alphabet
learning book and a dictionary should also survive even though most of
modern dictionary will probably be fairly useless by then and rest might
be unhelpfully terse.</p>
<p>Last I would add a book about ecology trying to explain complexity of
the world around us and why it would be wise to be careful how we try to
change it. There is probably no better definition of stupidity then
repeating same mistakes and expecting different results.</p>
<p>So <em>what did I end up with?</em></p>
<p>An alphabet book, a dictionary and books about medicine, agriculture,
mathematics, economy, sociology, philosophy, some basic technology and
ecology. There are no titles since I don't believe such books have been
written yet. We have lived in a world full of books and knowledge for so
long, that we simply never saw or had a reason to write a book premised
on the idea, that it might be one of few books around.</p>
<p>In any case, even though I have spent more thoughts on this then is
probably reasonable at this point, I am sure I haven't thought of
everything. What else have I missed?</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/reading-electrons.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Reading electrons">Reading electrons</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>My wife and I have a problem. We love buying and reading books, but ran
out of shelf space for them years ago. So we've been storing some of
them in closets and boxes while we find a more suitable solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://pdml.net/pipermail/pdml_pdml.net/2009-February/161396.html">Like
others</a>
we love physicality of books and it is hard to imagine buying artifacts
that exist only in digital form. However, while searching for a good
solution I did notice that useful life-span of most technical books is
only few years and that we would save a lot of space and trees if I
bought and read their electronic versions.</p>
<p>This has lead to my renewed interest in state of electronic readers,
which I've been following on and off since I first heard of technology
almost a decade ago. In last few months I got a chance to try first
version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com" title="Amazon Kindle">Kindle</a>, read few
chapters on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader" title="Sony Reader">Sony
Reader</a> PRS-505,
checked how it feels to do it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" title="IPod Touch">iPod
touch</a> and read
<a href="http://designingwebinterfaces.com/" title="Book's homepage">Designing Web
Interfaces</a> to the
end on Nokia N770. By the way, I can only recommend that book to anyone
interested in development of web applications.</p>
<p>So this post will be short overview of my experience so far.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated electronic readers</strong></p>
<p>As said, I've used Kindle1 and Sony PRS-505, although my experience so
far has been mostly colored by later. Most if not all such currently
available devices are based on same technology,
<a href="http://www.eink.com/">E-ink</a>, and hence offer fairly similar reading
experience as far as visuals go.</p>
<p>That experience is very good. It's not quite paper, but it is certainly
much nicer to read than computer screens, especially outside. It's most
annoying current limitation is probably absence of colors and depiction
of b&amp;w images in 16 or less shades of gray. You won't be buying photo
books for them any time soon.</p>
<p>What bothered me more though were tendency to use proprietary formats
(Kindle) and absence of search (almost everyone else). I expected that
device designers would notice that electronic format doesn't offer a
chance to flip through pages and remember position of interesting
passages spatially and would counter this by adding a search function,
yet most didn't and as such these devices really are readers and not
researchers.</p>
<p>With good technical books I spend more time looking up pieces of
information than I spent reading it in the first place. I guess I would
be willing to sacrifice search if devices themselves were significantly
cheaper, but since they aren't, I won't be buying one anytime soon.</p>
<p>Still, if you like reading lots of books but don't care about owning
them, you should really look into them. They are simply magnificient
when it comes to packing A LOT of books into tiniest amount of space
without sacrificing much readability. Hell, since most if not all
readers allow you to set text size, it might even be easier to read on
them.</p>
<p><strong>Tablets</strong></p>
<p>I own and use two, iPod touch and ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet" title="Nokia 770 Internet Tablet">Nokia
N770</a>.
It's a common story with multipurpose devices. You get to do a lot with
them, but you usually have to sacrifice something compared to
specialised gadgets.</p>
<p>I haven't read much on iPod touch and it's unlikely I ever will. It has
a fairly small screen (and screen resolution) that makes it rather
unpleasant to read texts with plenty of tables and diagrams. Pinching
screen looks nice on commercials and doesn't bother me too much when
browsing web, but it gets tiresome quickly enough that I don't want to
do it repeatedly.</p>
<p>I also tried Kindle application, which works well enough for literature,
but is even more limiting than Kindle device. There is no search and you
don't flip through pages all the time only if you are comfortable with
reading text at smallest font size.</p>
<p>Nokia on the other hand has screen good and big enough that I needed to
scroll only in one direction. Since that can be done with the same
button that is used to flip through pages, I could read book using only
one hand, which is nice since it let me read in most impossible body
positions. As iPod touch it also has a color screen that is quite useful
when dealing with technical material. What it lacks though is search in
its PDF viewer that is also missing even in latest maemo incarnation on
OS2008 (checked on Fry's tablet).</p>
<p>Too bad. Nevertheless it will remain my main
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book" title="E-book">ebook</a> reading device for
foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>Other observations</strong></p>
<p>As already noted, I feel current crop of readers are geared mainly to
reading books and not much to browsing or searching. Since most of them
are built on same technological base, it's understandable that their
hardware is very similar, but I was still surprised to see that same
lack of distinction when it comes to features implemented in software.</p>
<p>I thought about buying printed and electronic copy, but changed my mind
when I looked at <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516253/index.html">price of the
bundle</a>. What I
thought I would be buying is convenience. What price suggests to me is a
sale of another copy. I probably would buy both, if price of bundle
would be up to 15% higher than price of printed version.</p>
<p>That does not mean publishers are wrong, since I am hardly a
representative sample, but I suspect I am not the only one who is
thinking about building electronic library before they go ahead and
purchase a reader. This transitioning phase where readers are not
widespread yet might not be long enough to matter anyway and publishers
probably don't care about speeding it along since for most of them
devices are just a content transportation mechanism that isn't owned by
them.</p>
<p>Tablets, with screen and resolution big enough work surprisingly well as
long as you don't try to read under direct sun light. Their other
downsides are much shorter battery life and need for good eye-sight
unless you are willing to scroll a lot.</p>
<p>Still, even though I won't be buying an electronic reader this year, it
is only a matter of time when one of them will replace my tablets as
reading device.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/quo-vadis-nokia.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Quo vadis, Nokia">Quo vadis, Nokia</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>It's been a month since I got an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" title="IPod Touch">iPod
touch</a> as a
present and I've been using it regularly since. I still have and use
both a <a href="http://nokia.com" title="Nokia">Nokia</a> N65 phone and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet">Nokia N770
tablet</a>, but use
of later has been diminished in last month.</p>
<p><strong>iPod touch experience</strong></p>
<p>I can't help not to think of Touch as basically this decade's Palm
organizer. Thin widget with pleasant user experience that can be
extended with myriad of applications, whose developers are -- judging by
iPhone versions -- limited not by their imagination, but with device
capabilities and limited expandability.</p>
<p>I still don't like its on-screen keyboard and wish I had at least
something like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)">Graffiti</a>. Hence I
don't write on it anything longer than two sentences and together with
lack of camera, built-in microphone, GPS, Bluetooth or even just
self-made software, it makes Touch a read-mainly device. Consumer device
would be another, more ghastly, but appropriate description.</p>
<p>As a side note, even my now aged N770 tablet is more friendly to
creators and hence I still find use for it. I just don't want to browse
web on it because of its very very dated browser that can't be updated.</p>
<p>Still, even with annoying limitations I like iPod touch a lot. It's hard
not to with its polished interface and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" title="App Store">App
Store</a> that is
probably its killer application. Choice of applications in Slovenia is
more limited than in USA, but still very wide and downloading them is so
easy and cheap, you might have to fight against developing an addiction
to it.</p>
<p><strong>So what about Nokia?</strong></p>
<p>Mobile devices space has become really interesting in last year. iPhone,
iPod touch, Android with G1 and upcoming Palm Pre are finally bringing
experience on web and otherwise, that we were promised years ago. But
what this list lacks is any gadgets from Nokia.</p>
<p>I like Nokia. They had friendliest phones that are remarkably open in
industry that likes to control everything. I think their tablets are
great, even with shortcomings that should be resolved by now. But even
with lots of innovation I get an impression that they are lagging
behind.</p>
<p>As a complete outsider who only passingly follows what is happening in
mobile industry, I can only ignorantly speculate about its reasons and
plans.</p>
<p>I believe first problem for Nokia is that unlike
<a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple">Apple</a> or
even <a href="http://google.com" title="Google">Google</a> it's not a niche player and
tries to build phone for every possible user. It releases them too
often. Taken together it is no wonder that just Nokia Europe
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products">lists</a> 115 devices that are
either selling now, were recently or will be in near future.</p>
<p>That's too many devices, each with slightly different software, that
create a very fragmented market. In such environment you can't really
hope that application would be pushing phones capabilities which aren't
there in most cases. Hence applications Nokia offers are not nearly as
exciting as what Apple has.</p>
<p>Next problem presents development environment, which is simply awful.
<a href="http://www.symbian.com" title="Symbian">Symbian</a> might have been a nice
platform back when, but its time has passed and I doubt open-sourcing it
will help. Java hardly works better, but it's probably a bit nicer to
use even though it feels slower. Python is nice for tinkering, but not
really an option until it becomes pre-installed. There's also a web
runtime, which is mostly missing. Few phones support it and only one
phone available can use it for something more significant than a window
to web.</p>
<p>Much of what I just said is not true for tablets, but historically they
didn't seem to get much love from company. Too bad, since I think they
are one of the most exiciting things Nokia has.</p>
<p>I do remain an optimist. Purchase and relicensing of
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/" title="Qt (toolkit)">Qt</a> together with its
upcoming S60 version signals that company is aware of development
problems. Qt also offers a possibility of a framework that could be used
everywhere and hopefully this will include Fremantle. Generally I don't
put too much faith in rumors, but some of them give credible hints that
next tablet could be even better than an already great N810. If it also
brings a distribution model comparable to App Store and a bit more
polish, then it could be a big success even with non-geeks.</p>
<p>But what they need to do in my opinion is spend less time trying to
build all encompassing services like <a href="http://www.ovi.com/">Ovi</a> and
spend more effort in building amazing devices that integrate well with
what is already out there. And by integration I don't mean an app hidden
in some folder on phone. Upload to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>
should be available right after you took a photo. I also wish they
didn't try to leverage existing platform and users so much and were more
daring and forward looking. If platform you have is stopping you from
developing a phone you want, then find or develop a better one.</p>
<p>Until then I am sticking with what I got. A great phone for my needs
that few match and a couple of nice tablets.</p>
