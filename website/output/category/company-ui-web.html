            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I tried to leave a comment on <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> recently and
had trouble deciphering its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a>. I was eventually
successful, but only after I got annoyed. Simply put, CAPTCHAs are evil.</p>
<p>There's no need to rehash why, since
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+accessibility">plenty</a> has been
said so far. They <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">don't</a> really work
and they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Accessibility">exclude</a>
lots of people even if you do use an alternative audio check. As a
left-handed person, who curses every time he picks up an "ergonomically"
designed scissors, I kind of imagine how it is when things are designed
for a majority you don't belong to.</p>
<p>However, even if you could make them completely accessible (doubtful)
and would somehow be able to resolve the overlap between smartest
programs and, well, less-gifted humans (impossible), I'd still dislike
them. What they say to your readers is: "I'll make you work so I don't
have to."</p>
<p>Is this the message you want to communicate?</p>
<p>P.S: WordPress users, you really ought to take a look at
<a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, if you haven't done so.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>When we designed <a href="http://www.marela.si">Marela</a>, we obviously wanted to
make it as close to perfect as possible, but we paid even more attention
than usual to words and language used, since I find bad copy
consistently the most annoying element of web site design.</p>
<p>This might look odd coming from me. But not being a chef doesn't mean I
can't enjoy or respect good cooking. So I read articles like <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/resurrect_your_writing_redeem_your_soul/">this
one</a>,
hope that more people would do the same and try to do my best. I think
we're doing alright so far; no doubt largely because there are enough
capable and caring souls fixing after me my stupidity and sloppiness.</p>
<p>If the tone and words used influence how we feel and percept others in
our daily communications, why is it so difficult to imagine that this is
equaly true when communicating through a web site or user interface?
It's still communication.</p>
<p>And to make this post at least moderately useful, I give you a short and
far from complete list of words used in tech industry and what they
actually mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>technology:</strong> stuff that doesn't quite work yet</li>
<li><strong>open:</strong> works with our stuff</li>
<li><strong>robust:</strong> works with our stuff, will break with almost anything
    else</li>
<li><strong>quality:</strong> works most of the time</li>
<li><strong>dynamic:</strong> you have to be flexible</li>
<li><strong>proactive:</strong> active</li>
<li><strong>end user:</strong> user</li>
<li><strong>innovative:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>world class:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>leading:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>cheap:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>partnership:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>professional:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>any 3 or 4 letter acronym:</strong> we are smart &amp; give us lots of money</li>
</ul>
