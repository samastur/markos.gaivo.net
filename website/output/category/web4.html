            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>A Marela member notified us, that file upload doesn't work in <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/">Opera
Mini</a>. It's true,
because Opera Mini doesn't support file uploads which you can easily
check by visiting two <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/inputfile/index.html">demo
pages</a> with valid
XHTML. You shouldn't see a file input element on either of them.</p>
<p>I believe (but as an outsider obviously can't prove) it lacks upload
support for security reasons. Every web request handled by Opera Mini
gets transported over a proxy, which fetches the page in questions and
translates it in a compressed format suitable for viewing on small
screen devices. This means that file uploads would be sent to proxy as
well which depending on what is sent can be seen as a security
violation.</p>
<p>Of course it does allow logging in websites, a potentially unsafe
action, which puts my speculation on shaky grounds. But the true point
of this article still stands. Opera Mini doesn't support file uploads.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/role-of-graphic-design.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Role of graphic design">Role of graphic design</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web
designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS
Reboot</a> day. I find the idea at least odd, if
not exactly wrong, so this blog won't be one of them.</p>
<p>As can be clearly seen, I'm not a graphic designer. Even though I'm
certain my current design is better than previous was, it's not exactly
good either. There's also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife
picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability.
Then again, it's not my intention to discuss a particular design as much
as graphic design use and its role in general.</p>
<p>What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design
is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily
discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year.
It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging
software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page
of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence.
This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly
exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same
mold?</p>
<p>I'm sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or
where it's the story itself. But more often than not it's something that
not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it
is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only
when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does
so.</p>
<p>I don't write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting
value. I wish I was like <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a>
and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published,
but I'm not. What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one
coherent whole and it's vexing that design by its singularity implies
that.</p>
<p>In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they
should know better only implies values I don't share, but certainly
doesn't enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern
widely used content management systems which as all software embodies
values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often
rather ignorant users .</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p><a href="http://www.friedcellcollective.net/">Fry</a> gave <a href="http://web.zen.si/archives/2005/10/spletne-urice-2-mikroformati/">a
talk</a>
about microformats last October and some people back then were doubtful
about their usefulness. Yesterday I read <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/Blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">a
post</a>
by Ray Ozzie on the need for web clipboards and accompanying formats and
my immediate thought was that microformats were perfect for this use.</p>
<p>Ray Ozzie talks about a need for easy interoperability and exchange of
data between web sites and I believe most if not all of us who are
working towards this goal agree that feeds (RSS or whatever) by
themselves are not enough. Web clipboards seem to be a big step in right
direction.</p>
<p>The post itself has since been updated with more information and a
<a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">great
demo</a>
how microformats could be used as a clipboard format for greater
interoperability between different web services. You should check it out
even if you don't have doubts about the need for microformats.</p>
<p>I find it odd that these days I get more excited by stuff that's coming
out of Microsoft then out of Google.</p>
