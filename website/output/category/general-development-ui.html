            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I really dislike headaches and although I don't get them as often as I
used to, they are usually not as easy to shake of. That's why we have
several different pills in our home to battle this nuisance. I recently
noticed that one of them, Plivadon, has its name stamped in Braille on
the box (click for a bigger picture):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marela.si/photos/6581/?original" title="Full size picture"><img alt="A box of Plivadon
pill's" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/ndkvtPUIDCSxe-m9hlVPA8rI8xc.jpg" /></a><br />
It's great that <a href="http://www.pliva.com/">Pliva</a> (Plivadon's maker) makes
its product more accessible to blind people. At the same time, this is
also a good example of how difficult good accessibility is.</p>
<p>It's a common misconception that all blind people either know how to
read Braille or can learn how to. In fact, a large part if not majority
of them don't and can't. The reason for this is that you can learn
Braille only if tips of your fingers are sensitive enough and that's
usually the case only for those who were born blind or became blind in
their youth.</p>
<p>But blindness can be caused by an accident later in life or by various
diseases like diabetes, which means it's far more common among older
people, who through years of working with hands lost the necessary
sensitivity in their fingers. They are in such cases forced to cope with
their usual methods such as being very organized about where they put
things.</p>
<p>Pliva (and other companies) could help them more. They could make the
shape and size of the box more unique. They could stamp an easily
recognizable pattern on parts of the box, just like they did with
Braille. Anything that can make the tactile feedback more unique would
probably help.^<a href="#pliva-2006-06-05">1</a><a name="pliva1-2006-06-06"></a>^</p>
<p>Alas they, as more often than not we, don't do what they easily could.</p>

Notes:

1.  <a name="pliva-2006-06-05"></a>Braille sign on Plivadon's box is
    distinguishing enough mark for as long as there isn't a similarly
    sized box and a sign at the approximately same position.

                <p>Jensen Harris posted an interesting
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/11/29/497861.aspx">observation</a>
few days ago regarding "help" in programs. Microsoft's usability tests
showed that help is mainly used by experts and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I don't have data to back or refute his observations, but I did check
our logs to see how often is our help accessed and the number is so low
that I've seem to have talked about it with practically everyone who
actually visited it. Sure enough, all of them belong to more experienced
users who probably need it the least
^<a href="#invhelp1-2005-12-04">1</a><a name="invhelp01-2005-12-04"></a>^.</p>
<p>So let's assume that Harris is correct and inexperienced users don't
access help. I think there are three basic questions you're faced with
when designing a help system
^<a href="#invhelp2-2005-12-04">2</a><a name="invhelp02-2005-12-04"></a>^:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you get users to discover and use help?</li>
<li>How do you meet the needs of those who do?</li>
<li>What about the rest?</li>
</ol>
<p>Harris' observation doesn't change questions, but it does lead to
possibly different answers.</p>
<h4>1. How do you get users to discover and use help?</h4>
<p>The least you can do is to make it accessible from a standard place,
which is in the top right corner and to make it easily recognizable. If
everyone says it's Help, you should too and don't hide it with small
font size (we might be guilty of this) or inappropriate colors.</p>
<p>We tried to go further than this by also offering various means of help
in close proximity to where we think our members might appreciate it.
It's still too early for any conclusive remarks, but compared to general
use of our help, I'd say it's showing good promise.</p>
<h4>2. How do you meet the needs of those who do?</h4>
<p>If Harris is right and I believe he probably is, then this translates to
what are the needs of experienced users and how to meet them?</p>
<p>What we have so far is simply a FAQ of real questions that have been
asked previously. It's amazing how many companies think FAQ is a place
where they should put questions they'd like users to ask.</p>
<p>It's not much and certainly not enough, but there's been little need for
more so far. What I'd like to add is tips and other ways to deepen the
knowledge of those, who'd like to do so, but so far we've lacked the
time.</p>
<p>I've certainly discovered that absence of tutorials teaching basic use
of our service is not a problem. At least not so far.</p>
<h4>3. What about the rest?</h4>
<p>No matter how hard you work to make your product simple to use and how
easy it is to get to help for it, there will be people who won't know
how to use it and either can't or won't use help. How do you help them?</p>
<p>One way is to make mistakes really cheap. Everything that delays a
successful completion of intended task is a burden, a price payed not in
money, but in satisfaction. We're trying really hard to make it as cheap
as possible with lightning fast pages and non-destructive interfaces
where it's easy to fix mistakes.</p>
<p>I think it's already clear that this approach works very well. I believe
it's partially responsible why our help section is rarely used.</p>
<p>There are options like tooltips, that we haven't used yet. There are
probably options we haven't thought of. We'll try new stuff and when we
do, I'll let you know what we've learned.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="invhelp1-2005-12-04"></a>Before I go on I should point out
    that it would be nice to think that we got our interface right and
    most people don't need to visit our help section. However, without
    data to back that up it could also mean help is just too difficult
    to find. It's something we'll have to
    investigate.<a href="#invhelp01-2005-12-04">↑</a></li>
<li><a name="invhelp2-2005-12-04"></a>I assume that all conscientious
    designers strive for a design that would remove the need for help. I
    also recognize that this is often not
    possible.<a href="#invhelp02-2005-12-04">↑</a></li>
