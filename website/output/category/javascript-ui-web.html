                <p>There's an HTML pattern that has been bugging me for a while even though
I'm guilty of using it too. It's even present on page you are reading
right now.</p>
<p>Almost every page has a navigation bar and chances are that strip is
presented as some kind of a list of links. Just as it should be. What
bothers me is that when you actually are on page listed in navigation,
its navigation item will <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/" title="An example of this pattern">still
contain</a>
a link to it.</p>
<p>This reference to itself is like having a door in a room which leads you
back in. Not very useful and certainly misleading.</p>
<p>Better approach is to simply not have a link when that link would point
to page itself. Such HTML is also more semantic, since it's clear which
item was selected and where we are even without a style sheet.</p>
<p>When discussing this observation it was pointed out to me that with
proliferation of Javascript and AJAX you might want to give your
visitors a way to bring a page to a known state by reloading it. I think
this is more than adequately solved by reload button that every browser
has and most users know, but if you find having a link a better
solution, why not try a compromise. Just add the missing link with
Javascript in spirit of <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/link.html">this
demo</a>.</p>
<p>This way you won't polute content markup with behavior that should sit
on top of it.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Update 6.8.2009:</strong> This post is old and somewhat obsolete, but has
been kept alive by commentators. Hence I posted an updated version of
the script in comments.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> recently mentioned a
TEXTAREA improvement he found. As you type your text in the box, it
grows in length as needed to avoid having to deal with scroll bars.</p>
<p>I liked the idea and went to create my own version. Making it work in
Internet Explorer and Firefox was literally a matter of seconds. All you
really need to do is compare elements <em>clientHeight</em> with its
<em>scrollHeight</em> on key presses and increment <em>rows</em> attribute when former
is smaller than later.</p>
<p>But supporting Opera and Safari has proven to be an insurmountable task
for now. They simply don't seem to update any property that could
reliably be used for measuring the height of the text (but would love to
be proven wrong).</p>
<p>You can try a
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/growtextarea/index.html">demo</a>, which
also doubles as a test environment for reading interesting attributes on
the fly (updates are done with mouse over input box).</p>
<p>Random bits of observation:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>scrollHeight</em> is always bigger than <em>clientHeight</em> in Opera. Hence
    the need to ignore it using its unique fingerprint.</li>
<li>I didn't try to work out the length of the text by trying to count
    the number of lines (using <em>\n</em>) and the length of each of them.
    Proportional fonts prevent any such reasonable guess.</li>
<li>I didn't try to limit the growth of the box to the boundaries of the
    screen. I find page scroll bars the least annoying when scroll bars
    can't be avoided. It's a personal choice though.</li>

                <p>I've been neglecting my blog recently. There was no shortage of news,
but somehow I didn't feel like writing. My mind is preoccupied with
other things and where the hell is the cold and wet summer everyone
promised?</p>
<p>Google announced <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">accessible web
search</a> for the visually impaired. I
see it as a great step in creating an accessible web search for
everyone.</p>
<p>Najdi.si is
<a href="http://zemljevid.najdi.si/?q=" title="Link to map service">testing</a> a
slovenian version of Google maps, which obviously can't be more accurate
than its source data, but works very well nevertheless.</p>
<p>But I've been most pleased to discover something else. I gave <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=195" title="Link to talk announcement">a
talk</a>
recently and we spent quite some time discussing AJAX and Javascript
accessibility issues. I wish I knew back then about
<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML" title="Link to accessible DHTML implementation in Firefox 1.5">this</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is there a draft of a specification for making widgets
accessible, we even got a test environment with Firefox 1.5. I've only
had the time to scan through specification, so my view should be taken
with a big pinch of salt, but my first impression is definitely
positive. We'll see how it develops after I had time to digest it and
make a few tests.</p>
