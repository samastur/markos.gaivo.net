                <p>I'm back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn't
publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to
burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.</p>
<p>There are places where I've been, places where I wouldn't like to go
again and places like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>, where you ask
yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many
eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country
and its fantastic people, so I won't even try where so many have failed
before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn't miss it.</p>
<p>I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia.
Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3
letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or
have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced
have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought
by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department
it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars
out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be
good.</p>
<p>In other news I will be giving a talk at Web 2.0 Expo in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> on 23rd titled
"Easy Deployment of Site-Extensions with a Browser Plugin". If Berlin is
too far, then you can also hear it this coming Wednesday at 19.00 in
Kiberpipa at our regular Spletne urice talks.</p>

                <p>I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite
smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a
long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was
secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that
has stopped working, please let me know.</p>
<p>I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn
rich-text editing on. It's hard to imagine that it simply doesn't exist.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/suing-myself.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Suing myself">Suing myself</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>End of December is a time when I usually try to take stock of year
behind and create semi-plausible goals for upcoming year. I didn't used
to do this until some day, a few years ago, I noticed that my twenties
were gone. Since then it has become a habit that has served me well.</p>
<p>My biggest achievement this year is successfully suing myself. If this
sounds ridiculous, it's because it is. It would take too long to explain
why I came to do this, but it goes to show how far you sometimes have to
go to please some bureaucrat.</p>
<p>I worked a lot, to the point of postponing all my last years plans and
didn't get much in return. I honestly can't say I learned a lot and I
achieved even less of what I'm proud of. This year has simply been a
professional disappointment that I have no intention of repeating again.</p>
<p>Of course I didn't just wake up and discover my failures and failings.
They've been apparent to me for a while and I spent a large part of last
few months thinking about what interests me and what I want, can and
will try to do. I tried to form my <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">personal research
agenda</a>,
but failing to get specific enough I have decided to spend next year
learning about and exploring my areas of interest and see what I can
come up with.</p>
<p>Creating content, while popular, still feels awkward and limited. As a
<a href="http://www.lego.com" title="Greatest toys ever">LEGO</a> fan since childhood I
want to see if I can come up with a set of metaphors and building blocks
that yield great power of expression. The point isn't a tool for a
perfect expression of an idea as much as it is an adequate expression of
most ideas. Polishing can and should come later.</p>
<p>I got Beautiful Evidence by <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward
Tufte</a> a few days ago and it's an
astonishing book covering another topic I feel needs more (of my)
attention. When we manage to create something, we often fail to present
our ideas properly. Partly it's our fault since we can't help ourselves
not to rely on forms and traditions that came before web. It's also our
tools fault. When all you have is a blog, everything has to be squeezed
onto a timeline.</p>
<p>We're over-focusing on primary creations. As a reader I'm usually quite
limited in what I can do with a piece. These days I can make a vague
statement with voting or less vague one with a comment. I may also
forward a find, but that's about it. My actions are by and large limited
to statements about a piece instead of interacting directly with it.</p>
<p>I'm sure none of above mentioned problems is new or unexplored. Smart
people out there have certainly done wonderful stuff I haven't heard of
yet. Any pointers are always welcome. So next year I'll work less, learn
more (about it) and spend time playing with ideas that might appear.
Hopefully I'll have something to show in year's time. Who knows, with a
bit of luck I might even have something useful.</p>
<p>But before I leave, let me wish everyone merry holidays and a happy new
year.</p>
