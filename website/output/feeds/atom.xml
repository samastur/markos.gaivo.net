  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining
    &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    . A must watch is

     Vladislav Surkov
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I
    &lt;a href="40.html"&gt;
     became 40
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
    &lt;strong&gt;
     not
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"&gt;
     quantified self
    &lt;/a&gt;
    movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading"&gt;
     Again
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
     mjp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It
    &lt;em&gt;
     is
    &lt;/em&gt;
    something to keep an eye on this year.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don’t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best:
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and The Quiet American
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .

     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smut-Stories-Alan-Bennett/dp/1250003164"&gt;
      Smut: Stories
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Alan Bennett. Sex is rarely as funny as in this two stories, but the second story kind of peters out as if the author ran out of ideas to resolve the twisted mess.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253/"&gt;
      Developing Backbone.js Applications
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Addy Osmani. A very good, but occasionally slightly dated introduction to framework. Still highly recommended.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Handlebars-js-Gabriel-Manricks/dp/1783282657/"&gt;
      Instant Handlebars.js

     by Gabriel Manricks. Cover says it all: short, fast and focused examination of Handlebars.js. Great if you prefer books to online reading.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Backbone-js-Cookbook-Vadim-Mirgorod/dp/1782162720/"&gt;
      Backbone.js Cookbook
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Vadim Mirgorod. A quick dive into Backbone.js best when paired with previous book on the topic.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Vagrants-Novel-Yiyun-Li/dp/0812973348"&gt;
       The Vagrants
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Yiyun Li.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can’t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp/dp/1482374811/"&gt;
      Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jeff Knupp. A short but informative collection of tips on how to write “pythonic” code. The only real downside is book’s price.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Andrew-Miller-ebook/dp/B0052RMN1U/"&gt;
      Pure
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Andrew Miller. Works best when establishing atmosphere of late 18th century Paris and easy engaging read that turned out to be a bit of disappointment for me. I wish author had as much courage as he does talent.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       Soldiers of Salamis
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Javier Cercas.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/"&gt;
      The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024"&gt;
       The Quiet American
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Graham Greene.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn’t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567"&gt;
     GEB
    &lt;/a&gt;
    even if I discover that I don’t like it.

    Disappointed I stopped using Twitter at the end of 2011 and have since visited it mostly to follow up specific references. As a medium I found it lacking but ignorable until recently. While I was reading about the aptly named
    &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/nUX1A"&gt;
     Jacobinghazi affair
    &lt;/a&gt;
    I felt the urge to tweet and pronounce Twitter as possibly
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samastur/status/476707986006880256"&gt;
     more toxic than Facebook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This article has been provoked by
    &lt;a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/"&gt;
     Tomaž’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    polite disagreement and is my late attempt to explain what I couldn’t on Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    My objections
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Leon Wieseltier recently described Twitter as
    &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118125/leon-wieseltier-responds-alain-de-bottons-attack-twitter"&gt;
     a place of infinite discharge of emotion and promotion
    &lt;/a&gt;
    where nothing intellectually or linguistically substantial can be accomplished. It is a great and true enough description of Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Over the years a number of articles have discussed effects of new media on society in its largest sense. While I am interested in those my comment was mainly about Twitter’s role in shaping how individuals and communities think, communicate and behave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In blogging heyday I thoroughly disliked celebration of rapid exchange of half-baked ideas. Making them smaller and exchange more rapid is not an improvement. Ideas have always been cheap and plentiful when untested and inspiring to the unwitting. Twitter is vast and there may be much worth reading, but chances are most of what you will read will be soon forgotten fluff. Creating on a medium like Twitter is hard since most things worth saying can’t be clearly expressed in 140 characters, nuance is valued even less than continuity and every good tweet can be buried in a pile of inane responses.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One of the reasons why I originally stopped using Twitter was realisation that I found tweets from a fair number of otherwise congenial and intelligent people regularly off-putting. Twitter did not suddenly found their previously hidden depravity, instead its forced brevity of semi-public discourse made a great deal of it sound like movie informants wearing a wire. It is a great demonstration of how dialogue changes when we think others are listening and an insidious tool for normalising blanket snooping, much of it our own.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Research has shown that our brains keep adapting to their use and improving one skill often leads to deterioration of another or as McLuhan put it: “Every extension is also an amputation.” I lost count of people describing their difficulty with reading longer, more slowly developing articles after an expectation of instant gratification has been built by a steady diet of short ones. It doesn’t get more instant than a tweet and Twitter’s interface is optimised for non-discriminative reading of a never ending stream of tweets.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-1-note" id="twitter-toxic-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Can this really be good for a thinking person?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My tweet which led to this piece was provoked by an absolutely absurd argument closely matching Alan Jacob’s description of
    &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2013/12/twitter-at-its-worst.html"&gt;
     Twitter at its worst
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Maybe worst, but certainly not rare. Of course arguments with all the negative baggage are not exclusive to Twitter, but Twitter does seem a more emotive medium than most of them. Discussions on Twitter are commonly a sad sight because it isn’t built for dialog. It is a marketing machine and works best when used as such.

     &lt;/a&gt;

    Unsurprisingly millions of its users conform to its design hints by sharing content or less obviously with signalling group membership by snarking and sloganeering at sometimes only imagined opposition.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/sup&gt;
    about the nature of online fame recently made rounds and I can’t recommend it enough. Fame can appear without being sought and the longer it lasts, the more likely it is that the famous will become a stand-in for a concept to which public often responds negatively. This is especially unpleasant and difficult to deal with when the negative concept is tied not to what you did, but who you are or are perceived to be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On Twitter (as previously noted) tweets may be written with a recipient in mind, but can be seen by anyone so all of them contribute to our public image without it being in our control.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-4-note" id="twitter-toxic-4"&gt;
      [4]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Controlling tweets comprehension and propagation by relying on cultural norms to differentiate audiences does not work because those norms may not be well known and are certainly not accepted by everyone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We speak when we want to pass on an idea. Amplifying ideas of others can be worthy, but we are more enriched when new ideas are created and explored. The really interesting ones can be controversial, rough and in need of a nurturing environment in which to develop. Twitter is not that place.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mobbing and repression of unpopular opinion happens almost everywhere where opinions can be expressed, but the immediacy, ease of response and pay-off make Twitter particularly popular with trolls, sociopaths and anybody willing to goad their followers into collective sectarian hysteria. There will always be enough of them willing to tweet before thinking to pummel into silence everyone but the most determined. Only ideas at first protected by obscurity can develop and flourish in environment without boundaries.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Three pillars of Twitter design
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter earns money by showing ads. There’s another reason to be careful with any ad-based business beyond worrying about their usually insatiable hunger for our privacy. Its value is proportional to the amount of our time it captures.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-5-note" id="twitter-toxic-5"&gt;
      [5]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Seeing ads on a site you frequent should trigger an examination of how much time you are willing to spend there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I disliked Twitter’s design until I realised that its main purposes are spreading messages and increasing its use. It does those two things splendidly and kudos to Twitter’s designers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am obviously not privy to any internal information, but to me the foundation of Twitter’s design are three main values: terseness, immediacy and broadcasting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Terseness is of course the well known restriction of 140 characters per tweet because of a technical limitation which does not really exist any more. Its effect on writing however remains because writing thoughts longer than 140 characters is awkward and will in newest-tweets-first Twitter applications always result in a broken reading experience. It is ill-suited for human dialogue because we don’t express ourselves at tweet lengths and we don’t hear responses first. Life is not
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!"&gt;
     Jeopardy!
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it is not a coincidence that most messaging applications put newest messages at the bottom.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why doesn’t Twitter raise the limit? I can only speculate, but I believe there are other benefits to Twitter beyond the limit’s role in Twitter’s brand. Longer text simply requires more effort from writer and readers and makes the platform less engaging thus hurting both of the stated Twitter’s goals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter does not use time much as a design tool beyond a core belief that real time is the right time to deliver a message and that delivered messages should be displayed in the opposite order they were sent which at some point will practically guarantee broken narratives and constant change of topic.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most of us can’t effectively multitask because we can’t quickly switch contexts. We cognitively suffer when we try and reading tweets from unconnected authors in order in which they came is really just multitasking at high speed. There is no reason to believe that we listen as well and care as much as we would if our focus would not be constantly drawn to the next thing. Ability to listen fully and steadily is a difficult skill to develop, but quick to atrophy on Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter may tolerate a moderate use of its platform, but certainly does not want it. It will keep suggesting new people to follow no matter how many you already do to keep the stream of tweets from ever drying up. Without them you don’t have a reason to constantly check your phone for new tweets and fewer reasons to post your own.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other face of broadcasting is building up your audience which is how you’ll eventually see your followers once you get enough of them to not know many. And ever so helpful Twitter is here to get you to this point as quickly as possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First it provides a crude privacy model in which either everything is private or nothing is (ignoring direct messages that are irrelevant for this article). This not so gentle nudge to make output public is further supported by ubiquitous leader boards tracking followers, retweets and favourites, constantly reminding us of everyone’s standing and relying on our vanity to improve it. None of these would need to be so prominent if what really mattered was sharing and chatting with your friends. Putting a scorecard on our every utterance makes sense only if its most important feature is their popularity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hoarding followers and followees has another negative effect beside making already described ones worse. For historical reasons and because of web app limitations twitterers often use just one account, so subscribing to it conflates all author’s interests into one stream and while not merging different communities, it certainly exposes them more without them having much say in it. This, together with stilted expression, reduced comprehension and empathy, on a platform that promotes making an instant idiot of yourself in pursuit of recognition is, in my opinion, an important contributing factor to many heated arguments.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    In closing
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is not an exhaustive list of issues I have with Twitter, not even important ones (e.g. obtuseness of relying on any one source for important information). Much of what I said is not unique to this service but a lot of it feels more excessive here. What makes it different is the platform’s growing presence and influence in our society by its successful co-opting of promoters in us. Doubtless there is a lot of good that happens on Twitter or because of it, but the platform is also bringing out the worst in us and I find its damaging effects more substantial.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Writing this article reminded me of a larger point I have not made before or not often enough. Technology is not morally neutral or unipolar let alone inherently positive and it frustrates me that discussions often try to cast it thus. As a practising technologist I am obviously not a Luddite, but neither do I assume that everything I am able to make is good even when made with best intentions. Our creations shape what we do, how we do it and even who we are and should therefore be critically examined for what they do for and to us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As tools transform us and our societies I find pining for previous times unproductive, but I do not subscribe to technological determinism. We used freons for decades, but were perfectly capable of finding suitable replacements when we realised that our fridges would eventually fry us. But we did have to first realise and accept that.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     I know there are other clients. Well, mostly were. Twitter has been very open with their intention of eventually replacing all of them with theirs which already is the only one that matters.

     Since we can’t control which tweets will be seen by whom and which won’t, it is impossible in the long term to really shape their overall perception unless they are sufficiently dehumanised or we consistently act out only one persona.

   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now
    &lt;em&gt;
     know
    &lt;/em&gt;
    some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can’t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don’t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn’t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There’s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won’t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you
    &lt;em&gt;
     can
    &lt;/em&gt;
    do, better. Which is what I am doing now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I meant more books from authors translated into English (so not “Anglo-saxon”). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less satisfying picks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus 7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they were easily exportable and creating them wasn’t such a hassle.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     by Seymour Papert. A book  on constructivist approach to learning written for educators which for me was sometimes a bit of a challenge. Makes a persuasive case for at least a modified approach to learning (wasn’t won over completely) and did provide some intriguing possibilities for my work.

      by Sándor Márai.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation (from Hungarian via German).

      Books
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author’s view (which I do).

      Raising Steam
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really like to build a couple of things I’ve been postponing for years now. Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.

   &lt;p&gt;
    Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A year that started with
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"&gt;
     Aaron Swartz’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    death and ended with
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela"&gt;
     Nelson Mandela’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at
    &lt;a href="http://aptivate.org/"&gt;
     Aptivate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra"&gt;
     Socotra
    &lt;/a&gt;
    sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur"&gt;
     my Github history
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trepca"&gt;
     Sebastjan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Instead of building tools like
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
     mjp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or
    &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet"&gt;
     image-diet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to
    &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"&gt;
     set things right
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I’ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#avoid-stupid-1-note" id="avoid-stupid-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Why am I trying to say this?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Is it a matter of a principle or degree?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#avoid-stupid-2-note" id="avoid-stupid-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
     .
    &lt;/sup&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Can I be persuaded?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t always run through all these questions, but I’m sure I’m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     Update 2:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Tickets are now
    &lt;a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe"&gt;
     on sale
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no good way of contacting organizers
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    and not much travel information either on
    &lt;a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/"&gt;
     the DjangoCon’s website
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
    &lt;strong&gt;
     er
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="djangocon2014-note-1"&gt;

    I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regretfully I don’t have time to build this and it wouldn’t scale (I’m curious why Akismet doesn’t do something like that). So following Tomaž’s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don’t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn’t take more than a couple of weeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Building a secure web application is not easy, unless you also use 3rd party code such as Facebook’s Like widget in which case it is impossible. What you have is just an illusion of security, a door to abuse that you can’t even check if it is currently closed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or that’s what I thought for years. A once substantiated belief that grew into an almost dogmatic certainty until I recently got a chance to revisit it when trying to design a secure Javascript-based web application living inside of a likely untrusted environment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are obvious things you can do to protect your application such as delivery over secure connections and use of anonymous functions to sandbox your code from outside interference. However you will probably need to interact with external code at some point in which case is that
    &lt;em&gt;
     XMLHTTPRequest
    &lt;/em&gt;
    object you are using really the built-in one or has it been replaced (cloaked) with an impostor object to perform
    &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"&gt;
     the man-in-the-middle attack
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t know of a way to check if an object is untouched. What is sometimes used instead is a
    &lt;em&gt;
     .toString
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method which on functions and methods returns their source unless they are native to browser in which case it returns a string saying so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since you can replace any attribute and method on any object some
    &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6598945/detect-if-function-is-native-to-browser#comment8044242_6599105"&gt;
     go even further
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in search of a certainty and use
    &lt;em&gt;
     .toString
    &lt;/em&gt;
    from the
    &lt;em&gt;
     Function
    &lt;/em&gt;
    object.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At first thought that looked clever until I came up with:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol class="code"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&amp;gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Break check if function is native&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    The code above replaces
    &lt;em&gt;
     Function’s .toString
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method with a one that lies when executed on an also cloaked
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.postMessage
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Instead of displaying source of the new
    &lt;em&gt;
     postMessage
    &lt;/em&gt;
    it prints whatever browser would print for the original one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It simultaneously demonstrates how you can cloak native Javascript objects and hide that you are doing it. If you put malicious code into an anonymous function and remove
    &lt;em&gt;
     &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    node that added it after it gets executed, then there is no way for scripts loading later to know that it happened. There will be no traces of crime.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It might be difficult to cloak literals like {} and [], but you certainly can their methods so even if your code is wrapped in an anonymous function, it isn’t really secured from outside peeking and poking. Hence you even
    &lt;strong&gt;
     can’t trust your own code
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Turns out that this particular dogma is also true. Depressing.

    When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly Google Reader users or at least that’s how I imagined them. I certainly was.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Greader’s shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good time for late spring feed pruning.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the time it was up again, Greader wasn’t anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Google Reader for me was never just a way to plow through a large number of feeds, but also a database of important articles that I lovingly annotated with tags and notes when they still existed. Apparently I was in minority, judging by Reader clients and more importantly its own exporting tools which lets you take away most of your stuff, but not tagged items themselves.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hence I wrote a quick and dirty Python script which allows you to do just that using
    &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libgreader"&gt;
     libgreader
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . You can find
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/GReader-hoover"&gt;
     it on Github
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it has few other features like exporting all feed articles. Who knows how long Feedburner will be around so next step will be resolving those links.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My current backup amounts to almost 500MB so script is obviously useful to me. Hopefully it is also to others.  If you find bugs or data that is not exported, but should be, please do let me know.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am also looking for a good alternative that is
    &lt;strong&gt;
     not hosted only
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    service, supports archiving and can process most feeds. Currently I am biased to modifying Newsblur to support tagging and running my own instance, but I would definitely prefer to avoid this work if possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I like
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails"&gt;
     easy-thumbnails
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and use it often in my Django projects, but I wished for a long time that its
    &lt;a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/"&gt;
     PIL
    &lt;/a&gt;
    generated thumbnails would be smaller. That’s why I wrote
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet"&gt;
     image-diet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a drop-in extension for those easy-thumbnails users who use file system for storing images. Images remain visually the same, but can be significantly smaller (mine by more than 50% but your mileage my vary).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This matters because images are together with Javascript main cause for ever larger page sizes which leads to slower websites, especially in low-bandwidth environments. But really, don’t we all want our websites to be as fast as possible?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet"&gt;
     image-diet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was inspired by
    &lt;a href="http://imageoptim.com/"&gt;
     ImageOptim
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kilian/Trimage"&gt;
     Trimage
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I’m grateful to authors of both. It uses jpegtran, Jpegoptim, Gifsicle, OptiPNG, AdvanceCOM PNG and Pngcrush to do the heavy work of squeezing redundant bytes. Getting them should be easy as they are part of Ubuntu distribution and can be installed on Mac with brew. For more information please check documentation or ask.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I would love to hear any comments and ideas you may have, even more so if you try it.

    So I am not much of a planner. I didn’t read tomes and I read few work related books, but on the other hand I really enjoyed most of those I did read. Still it seems to be a challenge for me to really dive into world literature. I purposefully slowed my reading in second half of the year with aim of getting work done which
    &lt;a href="2012-review.html"&gt;
     didn’t pan out
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that well either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I suspect I also didn’t read as many tech books as I wanted because I mostly buy them in electronic form and don’t enjoy reading books on computer screens including tablets. E-ink readers are nicer, but underpowered and have issues displaying code samples well. Postponing decision is not working out, but I’m not happy with existing choices. Not sure how this will be resolved or when.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Links in the list still point to Amazon, but without affiliate IDs and are as always present only for those that are at least fine. Bold is reserved for those I found best:

    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Sense of Ending
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . If you are a web front-end developer, then you should also look at

      by Aravind Adiga.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I bought this book by mistake and don’t regret it. An astonishing and brutal portrait of India’s underclass that grips you and doesn’t let go even after you finish its last page.
    &lt;/li&gt;

     by Cennydd Bowles &amp;amp; James Box. Excellent guide on doing UX on the cheap that is also a good introduction to UX. There are few people who couldn’t learn something from this book.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      The Redbreast

      Object-Oriented Javascript

      In a Strange Room
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Damon Galgut. A book about traveling, un-articulated rootlessness and failed human connections that switches remarkably well between first-person and third-person narrator. It brought up some of my own almost forgotten memories and I would recommend it without hesitation.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Norwegian Wood
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Haruki Murakami. I don’t really know what to think of this book. It’s well written, engaging and reading it I do not not feel like time was wasted. On the other hand I don’t see depth others see or a master writer others describe. Still not a bad book to pick up.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      by Philip Ball.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I bought this book after I heard his talk on the same subject but still missed that it is foremost about painting colors. It is an amazing book which has significantly changed my perception and understanding of paintings and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in colors or visual arts.
    &lt;/li&gt;

     is among the most interesting ones I follow, but I was less impressed with this book on role of tempo in our lives and ways to work with it. There are certainly interesting ideas in it, but it often felt disconnected and too full of new jargon. I suspect I need to read it again with more focus and fewer interruptions.

      Innumeracy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by John Allen Paulos. Easy and interesting read, but it’s not clear to me what the purpose of the book is. It’s unlikely to be read by those who need it most or offer much in ways of tools and techniques. It is more of a cautionary tale of mistakes and lament about state of affairs which is still the same.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     How to Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish without a Trace by Frank M. Ahearn &amp;amp; Eileen C. Horan. A warning book for those who are not particularly paranoid and less useful as a how-to. The rest of us largely won’t be surprised although you might find out a thing or two. I hated author’s voice.

      by Matthias Politycki.

     A beautifully written multi-layered book about death, marriage, loneliness, memories… One of those rare books that not only can be re-read, but should be.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="https://smacss.com/"&gt;
      SMACSS
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jonathan Snook. A guide to writing modular CSS that should be easier to maintain and more reusable. A must read for web developers even if they don’t agree or use all described techniques.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

       Behind the Beautiful Forevers
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Katherine Boo.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     A devastating, uncompromising and well-researched look into life in an Indian slum. Together with White Tiger it significantly influenced and informed my view of India and I wholly recommend it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062009494"&gt;
      Dodger
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett. An enjoyable and informative recreation of Victorian London with a story a bit too predictive, straight-forward and far fetched for adult readers. Read only if you’re Terry’s fan or not an adult.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Sense of an Ending
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Julian Barnes.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Opinions may vary, but I recommend it without reservations. Really well written and was able to evoke memories of my youth without really describing it. I enjoyed reading it till the surprising and devastating end. Doubtlessly I will read it again.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year? More useful education, more foreign literature and hopefully one or two longer ones that have been on the shelf for a while.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Happy and healthy new year!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mine started as it ended, in bed with a nasty cold. We were in one of few places in Slovenia where there was snow, great weather and I got to experience it all mostly through windows. In a way it was a perfect sum of last year: missed opportunities and unexpected disappointments, but at the same time actually quite good if looked at from a different perspective. 2012 was a year full of health scares, not all of which were resolved happily (so far). I certainly hope this year will be better for my loved ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I learned last year that I don’t miss Twitter. Occasionally I read
    &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/friedcell" title="Marko's Twitter account"&gt;
     Fry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ‘s stream, but otherwise end up there only by mistake. There’s still work to be done on how to manage empty distractions and I miss tools that would help me decide what to read and how much of it. Facebook account — also gone (I hope; who can really tell?). Rarely used, never missed and incompatible with my convictions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Digital sabbath continues to be a great idea and I can’t recommend it enough. Setting too ambitious personal goals…to be avoided. Explicit goals can lead to worse results when it becomes clear they can’t be met, even more so if they morph from a metric to a substitute of original purpose. Knowing this I nevertheless managed to become a textbook case of a goal-induced failure and will need to spend quite a bit of effort to get in a better shape. Need to keep focusing on whys too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having a list of possible and finished projects on wall still frees my mind. I have just
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet" title="Image Diet - reduce size of images"&gt;
     released one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of them, but it is obvious I haven’t really stayed the course this year, switching projects with predictable result of finishing few and losing a bet with
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trepca" title="Sebastjan's Twitter account"&gt;
     Sebastjan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . You could look at it as the most expensive dinner of my life (if valued by time spent) or a hell of a good investment in code I will use this year. I prefer the latter (and what kind of twat would object to paying friend’s dinner).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I actually did work on my personal research agenda in my spare time. I just don’t have enough of it and it is what I struggle with most. I found development proceeds more smoothly when done regularly, but to do that I need to maintain a very detailed to-do list which allows me to make a meaningful contribution even when there is only half an hour to spare. I have also added reminders to my calendar to regularly review (or re-awake) my work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I decided to stop using these end of year posts for commenting on  external developments. So far mostly impotent protests in Slovenia left a  bittersweet taste. I am curious what this year will bring, but these  reviews tended to be bleak and I’m not becoming an optimist.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am happier. It really is a privilege to, not just nominally, work with and for people from whole planet on stuff that matters. I learned a lot as person and a developer from
    &lt;a href="http://www.aptivate.org/en/about/team/" title="Aptivate's team page"&gt;
     my colleagues
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I enjoy my work as much as when I started. However getting accustomed to our way of doing things and things we do can create a small worry of where I will be able to work, if I ever have to leave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It was definitely a year of personal change. Not sure who to “blame” for rediscovering a radical streak in me, but I am less willing to be silent when encountering prejudice and small-mindedness. Silence condones and some troubles should be embraced.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I would like to finish
    &lt;a href="http://www.delajozate.si/" title="All you ever wanted to learn about Slovenian Parliament"&gt;
     existing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/marela2" title="Great upcoming personal photo sharing app"&gt;
     projects
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that already have good foundations and to promote building web services for low-bandwidth environments (where low-bandwidth doesn’t mean just slow). That really should be enough. I expect it will be an interesting year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    As a person with a somewhat unusual fondness for measuring and modelling my own behavior I should be a happy buyer of
    &lt;a href="https://jawbone.com/up" title="Jawbone's UP"&gt;
     gadgets
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for
    &lt;a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one" title="Fitbit"&gt;
     collecting data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about myself and my environment. Yet so far I bought none, because they don’t seem to work
    &lt;em&gt;
     well
    &lt;/em&gt;
    without (occasional) data sync with producer’s servers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I really shouldn’t have to explain privacy standpoint of this. Describing my life and immediate environment in detail to a bunch of people I have never met, some of whom don’t even work for the company yet and trusting all of them that they will not compromise it for as long as they will keep it is to me self-evidently moronic.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But I also avoid such hardware even when data in question might not be particularly sensitive. If I am paying for something to be manufactured, then I expect to own it. If a gadget depends on an external service to be useful, then I am really only leasing it. Services disappear for many reasons and it doesn’t make much sense to rely on their availability unless you can host them yourself. I loath ads, but paying for a service is not a guarantee for its continuing presence either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not against functionality that reasonably requires at least occasional connection to grid. Most social features probably do. Products like phones don’t even make sense without network. Web interfaces certainly do make these devices cheaper and more quickly evolving. So there are certainly good reasons beyond roping you in to make them partially off-loaded on web.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However I don’t want to use those features and I certainly don’t want to give up data I care about for features I don’t. What I expect from devices I buy is my control of data and purchased functionality without others meddling or peeking over my shoulders.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a proponent of a view that 3D printing will radically change our society I read with great interest
    &lt;a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/digital_fabrication/the_future_of_3d_printing_mere_misnomer_or_something_more_23835.asp" title=" The Future of 3D Printing: Mere Misnomer or Something More?"&gt;
     a bunch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other/" title="3D Printers Are Not Like 2D Printers: A Rant"&gt;
     of articles
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.prsnlz.me/blogs/guestblog/3d-printing-then-now-and-in-the-future/" title="3D Printing — Then, Now and in the Future"&gt;
     with a less
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://graehamdouglas.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/3d-printers-are-not-the-future-of-manufacturing/" title="erspective on 3D printers from a mechanical designer"&gt;
     enthusiastic outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    written by people who obviously have more relevant experience and knowledge than me. They don’t quite reach a consensus, but have a fairly uniform sentiment I would like to address. While I do agree with most of their arguments and conclusions, I don’t with all and more importantly I think they are kind of missing the point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The above linked articles are really worth reading, but hopefully I won’t do them too much of disservice if I sum them up with: 3D printing will be too costly, too difficult, not useful enough and of too low general quality to have the same pattern of adoption as 2D printers which means they won’t end up in every home (with some type of computer).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Each of these points is true right now. It costs more to print an otherwise mass produced item (especially if you need to also buy a 3D printer). Of course this becomes less relevant if you want to create things that are not mass produced (
    &lt;a href="pimping-my-notebook.html" title="My 3D print fix for a design problem"&gt;
     or at all
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ), but even then you would be better off using an existing printing service (as I did). However cost of printers and materials have come down tremendously in last few years and it’s not difficult for me to imagine that at some point they will become accessible enough to become an impulsive buy. If we only bought stuff we need when it makes rational economic sense, we would own far fewer things than we do. Often they just have to become cheap enough and as cars attest that doesn’t even mean cheap.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is also true that preparing models for printing is not easy. However it is much easier than it used to be and I don’t see why it wouldn’t become even more so in the same way as have tools for other once specialist tasks (like photo editing). I am old enough to remember word processing of mid 80-ies and as much as  incanting commands was unappealing then, you don’t see many people needing to struggle with this today. And there could be even more help in form of existing downloadable designs or 3D scanners which could reduce burden of design from scratch to making small corrections instead.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Will we need printers often enough? No idea. I print on paper only before traveling and would likely use 3D printer more often, but I suspect I represent mostly me. I don’t know why anyone would still need a printer, but enough of them do that there is no shortage of models aimed at home owners. I did notice how my brush with 3D printing changed the way I perceive plasticity of my environment and while it is hard to tell how my view and use would be shaped if printing was even more accessible (I expect more things would get fixed instead of replaced), it is even harder to imagine that they wouldn’t. I am sure this would be even more true for kids growing in environment which is more pliable than today’s.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    An often repeated argument is that quality of printed stuff is not high enough. This may well be in most cases, but I expect will be less so over time. I don’t expect cheap printers or materials to catch up with expensive brethren or other options anytime soon if ever, but they may not need to.
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Description on Wikipedia"&gt;
     Illuminated manuscripts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    were supplanted by printed books even though they
    &lt;strong&gt;
     never
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    achieved their quality. Books simply became good enough. As millions of Instagram photos prove deficiencies can also lead to its own esthetic (but I wouldn’t count on this).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is difficult if not foolish to predict future of a particular technology, but when I do attempt it, I try to do two things. One is to list all its current limitations and try to imagine a future without them. If technology is not interesting enough without them, then it’s really hopeless. The other thing I do is to look at development so far and try to extrapolate what will happen to those limitations and how soon from technological and wider social context stand point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t expect 3D printing to follow an adoption curve of some other technology as this rarely happens. There is indeed a fundamental difference best captured by
    &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other/" title="Check fourth paragraph"&gt;
     Jon Evans’ observation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that we print on paper to convey information and use 3D printers to produce stuff. I do believe home 3D printers will eventually be at least as prevalent as paper printers if for no other reason because our appetite for stuff won’t go away as much as our need to use paper as a transport medium. However I also expect them to be present in houses void of geeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But my real point is that this doesn’t really matter. It seems there is an agreement that this technology together with others will radically transform our society and that bespoke manufacturing for individuals will again become more prevalent. Unless your business model absolutely depends on pushing millions of these printers in every home, does it really matter if I will print my designs on my printer or at a nearby corner shop?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t think it does as I don’t care if additive approach of printers wins over subtractive one of mills (however I find grinding inherently less appealing). In any case I do expect personal manufacturing to influence but not eradicate manufacturing industry and it will be interesting to see how much of it will see it as a threat needed to be countered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    I had a problem today. Given two database tables with first having a foreign key pointing to second, find those rows in second table, which are not pointed to from first. Well, it was slightly more complicated than this, but this was the tricky part.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tried to solve my problem using
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" title="SQL description on Wikipedia"&gt;
     SQL
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but I could not. I am not saying it can’t be done, but with my limited knowledge of SQL I could not produce a query that would not perform horribly. Working on production database under heavy use made this a real no-go.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After trying to come up with pure solution I finally gave up and decided to solve this problem pragmatically with some scripting. Turns out that too was more complicated than necessary. Unix shell tools are all you actually need, provided your dataset is not too big for your computer limitations (mostly memory).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Instead of searching for those rows directly, I changed my plan to create two sets of rows, first containing all possible candidates and second containing those from first set which are pointed to from first table. Subtracting second set from first would therefore give me exactly those rows which aren’t pointed to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If file
    &lt;em&gt;
     all
    &lt;/em&gt;
    contains a row-per-line list of all candidates and
    &lt;em&gt;
     linked
    &lt;/em&gt;
    a similar list of those that are linked to, then you can get non-linked by running following command:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     cat all linked | sort | uniq -u &amp;gt; non_linked
    &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What this does is following.
    &lt;em&gt;
     Sort
    &lt;/em&gt;
    will put duplicated rows together and
    &lt;em&gt;
     -u
    &lt;/em&gt;
    option of
    &lt;em&gt;
     uniq
    &lt;/em&gt;
    will display only unique lines which are those that can be found only in
    &lt;em&gt;
     all
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Problem solved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    Hearing something often enough can really change my perspective even on things I agreed with completely beforehand. It happened again after reading for umpteenth time that passion for programming/company vision is the quality every new hire should have.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Passion is a symptom, not a diagnosis.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I know a great developer with whom I would love to work again who is passionate about electronics. I am sure he likes programming and does it a lot, but it’s not where his heart truly lies. Which is alright because his other qualities more than make up for any passion deficiencies.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Passion in complementary direction is doubtless a positive signal, but I simply do not believe that
    &lt;em&gt;
     only
    &lt;/em&gt;
    people working on something they care deeply about are able to do it well. We can and do regularly care, with some degree of autonomy, about more than one thing (or person).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In more general sense my feeling is obviously a reaction to the end result of a process in which a useful guideline calcifies into dogma. Ideally I could get to this point sooner, but it seems unlikely. If I regularly reconsidered and doubted every piece of my mental framework, then it would mostly be mental and not much of a framework.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    It’s been a month since we returned from our  traveling around
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia"&gt;
     Bolivia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It was the most exhausting trip I have ever done and I ended up so weak that what ought to be a minor cold landed me in bed for few days. Luckily this happened only
    &lt;em&gt;
     after
    &lt;/em&gt;
    our return, but still I didn’t get to write this post then and I’ve been struggling to find time for it every since.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="imageR" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/sets/72157630657887612/" title="Photos from Bolivia"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not sure why I was so tired. We did spend quite a lot of time trekking, but not really more than we are used to. I suspect it had something to do with high altitude and sheer amount of information my brains tried to digest. A month of travel may sound long
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#bolivia-note-1" id="bolivia-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    , but it’s really too short to get to know a country especially one so big and unfamiliar as Bolivia. Best you can hope for is to learn enough to give your ignorance a bit of  a shape.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is also too short because you will need more time than you expect. One advice you hear often is that something will go wrong. It happened to us too and though you can be disappointed at times, you’ll mostly have fun, be amazed
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#bolivia-note-2" id="bolivia-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    and sometimes even shocked. Our schedule was packed and it will take me months to process all that we have seen and experienced, but I hope we can return soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Finding reasons to visit Bolivia is easy. Finding help for organizing this trip may prove more difficult. Pick an agency and search will turn up somebody who had a horrible experience with them. Not us though. We met amazing people who really worked hard to make our trip unforgettable which leads me to real reason for writing this post.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you intend to go and would like some local help, here are our recommendations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no shortage of hotels in La Paz and mid range
    &lt;a href="http://www.hotelrosario.com/la-paz/"&gt;
     hotel Rosario
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has deservedly consistently high reviews. It has great front desk staff (especially Ximenia), nice rooms and location. Dinners are consistently great too, but I would avoid lunch. Same kitchen but apparently different team and what you get might not be
    &lt;em&gt;
     exactly
    &lt;/em&gt;
    what you ordered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.america-ecotours.com/"&gt;
     America Tours
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is a travel agency recommended by Lonely Planet which can help you organize your way around country. Speed with which they were able to organize alternatives to our cancelled our trip to Madidi (thanks Amazsonas for nothing) was simply amazing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most people who visit Potosi stay in town. It’s certainly cheaper than alternatives, but if you can afford it, then a good place to stay is at
    &lt;a href="http://www.hotelmuseocayara.com/"&gt;
     hotel museo Cayara
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that is about half an hour drive away. Museum and a chance to talk to Arturo alone are worth it. Hacienda that has been there since 1557 is in the middle of beautiful nature and away of polluted surroundings of Potosi and is a popular destination for daily trips organized by travel agencies in Potosi (a good alternative for those on small budgets).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Usual way of seeing the largest salt flat in world is to travel to Uyuni and take a trip with one of many unreliable operators who are often hostages to their prone-to-drinking drivers. I believe it is better to travel to Tupiza (if you have time) and take a slightly longer tour. We had really good experience with
    &lt;a href="http://www.tupizatours.com/index.php"&gt;
     Tupiza Tours
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but my advice to those who prefer email for arranging their trips, is to start at least a couple of weeks before they go because girls at Tupiza Tours seem to be swamped in work. Or call them if you can. If you pick them, then ask for Hernan Cordova, the best off-road driver we have ever met (and Spanish speaking guide), and Jeaneth Menchaca Condori if you need an English speaking guide. They went above and beyond their duty, really made every effort to anticipate our wishes and needs and had an unlimited amount of patience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are many agencies in La Paz that will take you trekking and prices vary significantly.
    &lt;a href="http://www.andeansummits.com/"&gt;
     Andean Summits
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is certainly not among the cheapest, but they are very professional and accommodating (like with our last minute request to change dates of our trek). Ask also for Gustavo Miranda Hulliri, who apart from being a great cook and camp manager also seems to know every path there is. This can be really useful if you, say, get really weak because you were throwing up all previous day.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Tourist guides in Bolivia have to be certified. Most of them studied tourism and are very good. Still we were especially impressed by Julia Catunta Janco who consistently surprised us with showing us things we wouldn’t even think of asking. She would be our first choice unless you go climbing. Contact me if you need her email address.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One sure sign that your guide was really good is that saying goodbye feels like leaving a good friend. It is a feeling we didn’t expect before, but felt repeatedly once we were there. Life is too short to visit every place we would like to see, but I still have no doubt that we will return. I hope this post has been of some help to those of you who might be thinking of visiting Bolivia.

     Popular stereotype of a Japanese tourist used to be someone who took pictures non-stop. Someone explained to me once that this is a necessary memory aid for short vacations with packed schedule because it can help you recall and organize memories later when you’re back. I don’t know if this is true for Japanese, but it is certainly true for me.

     I knew Bolivia was rich in minerals, but I had no idea that there were so many mines which often exist in the most inhospitable places. Even big scale mining (such as for silver around Potosi) is usually done individually and this is even more true for small mines where there may be only 10 or so miners risking their life. It’s very hard and often short way to live that can still be better than alternatives.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We visited a wonderful exhibition a few days ago about two failed Antarctica expeditions led by
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="Robert Scott at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Scott
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton" title="Ernest Shackleton at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Shackleton
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I learned a lot, but what I keep thinking of are Frank Hurley’s glass plates.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hurley" title="Frank Hurley at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Frank Hurley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was the official photographer on Shackleton’s
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition" title="More at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Trans-Antarctic expedition
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (1914-1917). Shackleton and his crew encountered ice farther to the north then they expected and eventually got stuck in it. It is impossible to imagine how they felt when their efforts to free their ship Endurance proved unfruitful and had to spent arctic winter on it. Ship had to be abandoned by the end of October 1915 before surrounding ice crushed it. Crew then spent next few months on floating ice. They decided to seek safety on land which meant hauling what they needed by themselves and leaving everything else behind. Which brings us to Hurley’s plates.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    These were early days of photography and equipment was larger than it is now, but even today’s gear for taking large format photographs is pretty big and heavy as are prints made with it. Hurley had two cameras, a large format one capturing images on glass plates and a smaller portable Kodak using film
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#glass-plates-note-1" id="glass-plates-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . He made more than 500 images on plates which were too heavy to carry them all, but he managed to persuade Shackleton to pick and keep 120 or 150, depending on source
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#glass-plates-note-2" id="glass-plates-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then he broke the rest.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I couldn’t find an explanation for his action in one of the most inhospitable places on earth where environment should soon enough destroy those plates without his help, but I think I know why he did it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Expeditions were expensive and selling publishing rights for images made during trip was an important source of funding. Breaking plates ensured them that their images would be the only ones that could be printed. Breaking them was in essence an enforcement of copyright.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no moral to this story. It was doubtless a difficult decision in even more difficult situation. But it is hard to look at remaining images and not feel a real sense of loss. Such a waste!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are in London these days, then go and see this exhibition which you can find at
    &lt;a href="http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/"&gt;
     Queen’s gallery
    &lt;/a&gt;
    just next to Buckingham’s palace until April 14th. I bet you won’t regret it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Exhibition closed and my theory is wrong. As visitor pointed out (with Frank’s own words) plates were broken to remove temptation to return for them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="glass-plates-note-1"&gt;
     Kodak, one of pioneers of photography, recently abandoned making cameras to solely focus on their soon to be dead image printing business.

   &lt;p&gt;
    Michal Migurski recently posted
    &lt;a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/bandwidth.html"&gt;
     an article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about download sizes of popular websites. I couldn’t replicate his results
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#save-bandwidth-note-1" id="save-bandwidth-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    , but it is obvious that gist of Michal’s article is correct, websites have indeed ballooned significantly in last few years.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This blog’s homepage has a footprint of around 250KB-270KB
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#save-bandwidth-note-2" id="save-bandwidth-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . About 90% of its size are fonts and
    &lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;
     jQuery
    &lt;/a&gt;
    which is a big penalty for making it look and behave a bit nicer. So should I remove those parts?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, for most visitors to this website that difference doesn’t matter. Pages for them are neither slow nor expensive to load. Unless of course they are doing it over your average hotel Wi-Fi or a slow mobile network where speed around 56Kb/s is not unheard of. On such connection it would take about half a minute to load this blog. It can also cost more than 10 euro cents to load it when roaming in Europe.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be great if I could offer a choice of serving bigger and nicer or smaller and faster version depending on visitors needs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Measuring speed is not easy, but certainly doable as Gmail has demonstrated. You could start a timer immediately in page header, measure how much time it takes to load a smaller version of a website and if that happened quickly enough upgrade it to full bling. Android browser also added support for
    &lt;a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/index.html"&gt;
     navigator.connection
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Javascript property which, where it exists, probably has more details than you would need.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However there is no way to measure price of a visit. Even if I could, how would I decide what is too expensive for an anonymous reader and should I make such decisions at all? I think not.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Gmail’s approach is really just a band-aid over what should be a visitor’s decision. I use same laptop and browser at home and while I travel, experiencing all combinations of connection speed and pricing. I never know how much it will cost me to visit a page, but I always learn quickly if I would prefer something small or full-featured. There is just no way I can communicate that preference.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be great if my browser had a switch for this purpose, like Firefox’s “Work Offline” toggle. So if I switched to bandwidth saving mode, then every subsequent request to web server would communicate my preference with a HTTP header field like:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     X-Bandwidth: save
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In principle you could have multiple levels of bandwidth consumption, but that would likely be an overkill. Common practice suggests that at most two levels would really get used, one aimed at mobile devices and other at desktop.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Header like that might be enough, but even better would be if Javascript environment got another property describing current state of user’s preference (like say
    &lt;em&gt;
     navigator.bandwidth
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ). Coupled with a bandwidth event triggered on change you could really optimize every modern web page, even those with more complicated loading of resources and execution paths.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Right now such functionality doesn’t exist or at least I couldn’t find it (I even searched Mozilla’s bug database for any future plans). I think my proposal is both user and developer friendly and workable. If you can think of a reason why it would be problematic, then I would really like to hear it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="save-bandwidth-note-1"&gt;
     Pages are often personalized for visitor. Developer tools of different browsers also don’t report same sizes. They also report amount of data transferred not the size of that data once unpacked. Almost 2M of Twitter’s Javascript is thus reduced into page of “only” about 1MB of data transferred. And that to display couple of sentences.
     &lt;a href="#save-bandwidth-1"&gt;
      ↩
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="save-bandwidth-note-2"&gt;
     Depends on browser used. Variation in sizes is probably due different formats of fonts used by browsers. It also changed once I published this post.

    These have been eventful couple of days for web developers. CSS Working Group chair

     called on everyone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to use all (most?) vendor prefixes and stop making websites for WebKit which is becoming a new (mobile) IE6. Responses have been numerous,
    &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/02/the_vendor_pref.html" title="PPK's first article about prefixes"&gt;
     including

    who in his usual obnoxious manner
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#beta-prefix-note-1" id="beta-prefix-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    made some good points. Testing on mobile devices is an unsolved problem (who wants or can afford to buy so many almost immediately obsolete gadgets?) and introducing -beta- (maybe also -alpha-) prefix would simplify our lives while keeping most benefits of vendor prefixes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like -beta- idea and I think adding -alpha- might be even better. There’s still a problem of resolving syntax conflicts between different implementation which I think has a simple solution that closely mimics what browsers already do:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     When parsing CSS browsers
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     should apply the last matching -beta-/-alpha- directive they fully understand.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Browsers already ignore directives they don’t understand and they apply last directive found when there are multiple candidates for a DOM node.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Such behavior would give us less CSS code to write and maintain, have predictable behavior and keep browser experimentation without favoring one. I have troubles finding negative sides of this approach, but do let me know if you can think of one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="beta-prefix-note-1"&gt;
     I deeply dislike his complaining about simplistic view of others while himself generalizing and name-calling (the lazy and stupid lot of us). Alas it’s not good to read only people you like and agree with.

     Warning:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I started using
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Description of IRC"&gt;
     IRC
    &lt;/a&gt;
    almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of
    &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;
     Tumblr
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and a
    &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" title="Definition of neologism"&gt;
     neologism
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I never heard of something like that related to
    &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;
     WordPress
    &lt;/a&gt;
    although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29" title="Ulysses - an example of such work"&gt;
     Joyce-like stream of consciousness
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff
    &lt;em&gt;
     and
    &lt;/em&gt;
    really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but three are probably enough. So here’s my annual list of books I read in 2011. I typed “this year” first. Obviously celebrating new year is not enough for my mind to completely switch and I’ll probably be in danger of writing 2011 where I shouldn’t for another fortnight or so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Why I stopped"&gt;
     stopped striving
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to read a certain number of books and I’m happier for it. Looking at the list I am mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice of books related to my career. It’s not that books themselves would be that bad (most weren’t), but why on earth did I spent so much time reading things tangentially related to what I do?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To safeguard from my tweaking of this blog’s theme, here are recommended spelled out:
    &lt;em&gt;
     Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Unfolding of Language
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . I also want to specifically mention
    &lt;em&gt;
     Copper
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     Atlas of Remote Islands
    &lt;/em&gt;
    both great in their own way which are not bolded but maybe they should be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon  and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following  these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of  another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise to fix it for next year’s list, especially since I’ve never earned enough to buy even one book.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Without further ado here is the list:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316069884"&gt;
       Eating Animals
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Jonathan Safran Foer
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Great book that you should read even if you have no plans to become a vegetarian (or vegan).

      The Cello Suites: J. S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a Baroque Masterpiece
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Eric Siblin. Who knew there is such a fascinating story behind cello suites and Eric tells it very well.

      Hardboiled Web Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Andy Clarke. I wish I didn’t have to read word hardboiled so many times, but otherwise a must-own book for every web front-end developer.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060878134?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060878134"&gt;
      The Yacoubian Building
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Alaa Al Aswany. I read this at the end of January, when Egypt was engulfed in protests against regime and it provided an excellent background to why protests were happening. A truly captivating look at modern Egypt society.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Buying a Fishing Rod for my Grandfather
     &lt;/a&gt;

      Epitaph for a Spy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Eric Ambler. I don’t read many mystery books, but I read this one with pleasure. It aged remarkably well.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321687299?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321687299"&gt;
      Introducing HTML5
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Bruce Lawson, Remy Sharp. A good, hands-on introduction to HTML5 and related technologies that occasionally forgets to mention browser support and is already somewhat out of date. Luckily second edition is out (or should be soon).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014311820X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=014311820X"&gt;
      Atlas of Remote Islands
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Judith Schalansky. A beautiful book. A delightful way to spend a day reading about mostly unknown islands.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806027?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596806027"&gt;
      HTML5: Up and Running
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Mark Pilgrim. I read this one almost back to back with Introducing HTML5 and there is surprisingly little overlap between them. It can feel too geeky and repetitive in places, but it has best treatment of data-* I’ve seen so far.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144953662X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=144953662X"&gt;
      Life Nomadic
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Tynan. A book of anecdotes and lots of practical advices aimed at digital nomads, which has surprisingly large amount of useful tips for us who don’t travel as light or for as long.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       Herztier
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Herta Mueller
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Without a doubt one of the best books I read in years and also one of the most heart wrenching. Literature at its best.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       Skylight
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by David Hare
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Great drama with amazing amount of substance. Probably not for you if you are politically right (wrong) leaning.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy"&gt;
      The Elements of Content Strategy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Erin Kissane. Good overview which confirmed it’s not a problem I’d have. Or career I’d choose.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     EffectiveUI by EffectiveUI. Overview with some concrete propositions written for audience that doesn’t include me.

      97 Things Every Programmer Should Know
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Kevlin Henney. Mostly uncontroversial and insightful often enough to be worth at least a quick browse.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652269X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=059652269X"&gt;
      97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know
     &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;

      Confessions of a Public Speaker
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Scott Berkun. A fun book with lots of good tips which still can’t make you a good speaker without practice.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449307116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449307116"&gt;
      Think Stats
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Allen B. Downey. I read this book too soon, before it was published. Content was promising, but code was sloppy and buggy. Most useful to (Python) programmers who want to learn basic statistics.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AH7GO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0056AH7GO"&gt;
      Dry Side Up
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Martin Ony. I know Martin so I may be biased, but I also don’t like travel literature. This is the book I would get if I wanted to know how it FEELS like to raft through Grand Canyon. Fun to read even if you don’t have such plans.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062011847/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0062011847"&gt;
      Snuff
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett. Felt a bit sentimental and certainly not among his best, but I nevertheless enjoyed it as I’m sure most fans will.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O8MVGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000O8MVGY"&gt;
      The Chains of Heaven: An Ethiopian Romance
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Philip Marsden. Interesting, insightful, fluid, but still travel literature. I liked it as much as I can like travel literature.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai. A rather uneven book that doesn’t quite live up to praise it received. Sometimes brilliant, often not, but almost always tragic.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545098939/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0545098939"&gt;
      Copper
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Kazu Kibuishi. A melancholic comic about a boy and his dog that fits my temperament perfectly. Most, but not all, cartoons can be found on web, yet book is still worth buying.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Unfolding of Language
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Guy Deutscher
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Fascinating and well-written book about how human languages did and might have developed. Can’t recommend highly enough.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608191664/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=160819166"&gt;
      23 Things They Don’t Tell You about Capitalism
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Ha-Joon Chang. A must read for free-market proponents and less so for well-read people. It contains some surprising information for everyone and is easy to read. I wish though there were more links to data in notes.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one reason or another put off. I find I read too much from “Anglo-Saxon” authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.

   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s hard to judge importance of events as they are unfolding or soon afterwards, but 2011 feels in many ways like a historical year and I will be amazed if it doesn’t prove to be such. Arab spring and
    &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598"&gt;
     unresolved eurozone crisis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    alone practically guarantee that this will be a year to remember although it’s too soon to say in what light. There are definitely plenty of good reasons to worry, but there always are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year was also a year of big personal changes. I left
    &lt;a href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Zemanta's homepage"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in summer and went on sabbatical. Leaving a company in  the middle of economic crisis doesn’t sound like a prudent idea, but I’ve yet to regret it. I started contributing open source before I left, but having more time certainly helped me do more of it and with a bit of luck I may even finish first version of my web Instapaper client before this year runs out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I built
    &lt;a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si/" title="Supervizor's homepage"&gt;
     Supervizor
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with Primož, which is a project I am most proud of. We haven’t done everything we set to do yet and we unlikely will this year, but I hope that in early 2012 Supervizor’s data will become easily accessible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There were lots of experiments on myself. Having a list of possible (and finished) projects on wall feels liberating. Counting books I read
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="My post on gamification of reading"&gt;
     doesn’t work
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but digital sabbath is great. I left Twitter for better use of my time, but it’s really too soon to tell. I  learned and did a lot, more than I expected, but as always less than I hoped. Somewhat unintentionally we reduced our carbon footprint further even though we traveled a lot.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also finally found time to really reflect on what I want to do and my
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html" title="Brad Neuberg's post on creating personal reasearch agenda"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is getting more of a shape. I want to work most on use of open data to improve civic engagement and exploring
    &lt;a href="reading-sources.html" title="Link to definition in second annotation"&gt;
     social software for introverts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what will 2012 bring?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nobody really knows, but this year it became clear to me that I want my work to be more socially engaged and I am thrilled I got an opportunity to join amazing people at
    &lt;a href="http://www.aptivate.org/" title="Aptivate's homepage"&gt;
     Aptivate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for I hope a long time. I’ll continue to work on a so far semi-public open data project which I am sure will become public soon. I plan to read lots of books, but start less than two new projects. I am sure I won’t finish everything I set to do, but that’s alright. We always overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in ten so I  just need to keep going.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And surely I will continue to worry. There are only more reasons to despair over environment and eurozone of today might not be around this time next year. However we are not pilling on canned food yet so optimist in me obviously hasn’t completely died yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But first I will enjoy holidays. I hope you will too and I wish you a happy new year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    I’ve been fiddling with my website again, changing theme switching from somewhat dumb class based system to a more proper one using alternate style sheets. I learned that picking a style sheet in browser applies those changes only to currently open page, so for style sheet selection to persevere it needs a bit of Javascript support from website owner. Personally I find this just stupid.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The easiest way to remember visitor’s preference is to store it in his browser. Cookies used to be popular before they were deemed evil, but they have other limitations as well. Hence popular switch to HTML5 in-browser storage technologies like
    &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/"&gt;
     localStorage
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think there is one important difference between cookies and tools like localStorage that is often overlooked and it’s not the size of data that can be stored. Cookies are sent with
    &lt;em&gt;
     each page request
    &lt;/em&gt;
    while data stored elsewhere isn’t. Changing them on any side will automatically share state with the other. I use localStorage in my theme switcher because I think server doesn’t need and should not know which theme is used. But for storing shared data, especially one that expires, cookies remain a reasonable if not best choice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    None of this is exactly new, but I think it is worth remembering. In other news I dislike interface limitations of Chrome more and more (exceptions are Developer Tools and extensions framework).
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    Google Reader was redesigned lately and I’ve been annoyed ever since. I had a dubious privilege of cutting and changing product features people loved in pursuit of
    &lt;del&gt;
     higher
    &lt;/del&gt;
    different goals, so I try to be understanding when others do the same. I mostly found clumsy workarounds for removed features, but I do wish I could at least still trust that list of unread items actually has
    &lt;em&gt;
     all of them
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . On a positive note I can save some electricity now because copious amounts of “helpfully” white whitespace illuminate this room brightly enough that you wouldn’t sit naked in-front of your computer even with lights turned off. That is if you are the sort of person who likes doing that but stops short of flashing your neighbors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still strongly dislike changes made, but I continue using Google Reader, because crack-heads don’t give up dope just because it was cut too thinly. I cherish my list of reading sources and like a gardener I have been cultivating it through years because I believe they make me better informed than I would be if I relied only on links shared by others. This may be elitist, but it is also true.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We are biased when choosing friends and communities we belong to. At the very least we enjoy our life more when surrounded with like minded people which is really a lighter shade of group think. We share to tell stories as much about what is shared as we do about who we are. Even when not self-censoring or trying to project an image we still are horribly bad at evaluating what influences us and how. Sharing everything, as
    &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/"&gt;
     this idiotic article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    suggests, doesn’t fix this
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#reading-sources-note-1" id="reading-sources-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . It’s still content from same people only more of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then there are social new sites, which are in essence news organizations with bigger editorial board. Their focus might not be the same and their world view less obvious (or not) as of traditional boards, but the end result really isn’t all that different. I don’t dread waking up in a world without
    &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple's homepage"&gt;
     Apple
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as I do in one without  fish, but it is not articles about all things piscatorial that keep popping up on regular basis.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This doesn’t make socially filtered news useless, just limited and best suited for finding out what is popular at this moment. They should be a side dish not the whole diet. Getting some of your information diet from social sources may improve it, but relying only on them is just stupid. I wouldn’t fret so much if I didn’t worry about development trends — latest Reader changes being one example of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Reader had two methods of sharing. Obvious one was button Share which was adequately replaced with sharing to
    &lt;a href="http://plus.google.com"&gt;
     Google+
    &lt;/a&gt;
    circles. The other one, which was the one I actually relied on, was to create public feeds for articles marked with certain tags. The most important difference is that in first case you grouped by intended audience and in second by actual content

    . Instead of following me, you could just follow my selection on particular topic which in most cases would probably be closer to what you want.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By itself stripping a feature like that doesn’t mean much. However when I also judge other changes such as aforementioned abundance of whitespace, removal of “Note to reader” and  new reading unfriendly theme, it’s easy to come to conclusion that all roads now lead to Google+. Reader’s role is at best to feed its younger brother with stuff to socialize around.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be wrong to attribute these changes simply to competition with Facebook since they are a part of a larger trend to social curation. I find this trend just a normal consequence of a web ecosystem where most product innovation happens in VC funded startups. How companies were funded was always a part of their DNA and economics of today’s VC environment for companies that will probably be acquired at some point (and let’s be honest, who REALLY believes most news experiments won’t be?) almost demands a quick and high growth. It’s not impossible to achieve this with sources-based product, but it’s certainly harder and less obvious than creating another twist on social news.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If my first and main point was a personal appeal to seek insight also in your own, personally picked sources, then my second is to question if shaping web and world with it should really be left only to industry and academia. It really doesn’t have to be this way.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     Browser’s history is a great place to see just how much of what we visit is unimportant, unrepresentative and often unsharable. A small friction necessary for a deliberate act of sharing is actually a feature that gives at least a modicum of reflection on content’s share-worthiness.

     Feeds enable that and are one of crucial building blocks for what I started to call
     &lt;em&gt;
      social software for introverts

     .  It is software which is better when used by many, but is good even when  you are its only user.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I never intended to, but somehow missed last few elections because they were on dates when we were travelling. It looks like this time will be different so we have spent quite some time so far thinking about whom to give our votes. Like most people I know I find most parties in Slovenia distasteful and while I am not enamoured by anyone, I think I will be able to cast a vote. But I do wish our system was slightly different.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s what I would change if I could:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      Introduce a
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_voting" rel="wikipedia" title="Preferential voting"&gt;
       preferential vote
      &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/em&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     (only first and second choice). It kind of sucks that you have to decide between a party that you would like to vote for and a party that actually has a chance of getting in parliament according to polls. I know I am not alone with this dilemma and I often wonder who people would pick if they were not afraid of “wasting” their vote.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting" rel="wikipedia" title="Compulsory voting"&gt;
       Compulsory voting
      &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/em&gt;
     (but only with point 3). Everyone who can vote really should unless they can provide a good reason why they can’t. Voting every few years really should be the bare minimum of citizen’s civic engagement.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      Add an explicit choice “Nobody from this list”.
     &lt;/em&gt;
     Voting for least awful can still be unpalatable. Right now we also can’t distinguish between people who didn’t want to vote for anyone on the ballot and those who couldn’t be bothered. It’s easy to see low turnouts as a failure of democratic process when it has less to do with process and more with available choices. “Nobody” votes should be counted when calculating parliamentary threshold since they are votes against all parties, and ignored when calculating how many seats parties in parliament get.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regretfully these changes wouldn’t benefit parties in parliament (whichever they are or will be) so there is  almost a zero chance that above changes will happen. Unless of course there is enough popular support to have a referendum.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do practically all of my work on Sony VAIO notebook I bought 3 years ago. I picked it because it was very light (less than 1.5kg), small, had great screen, keyboard and battery that seemed to last forever (around 11 hours without WiFi and about 8 with it). I still love this machine, but it has a remarkable design failure. Let’s see if you can spot it on this picture?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Detail of Sony VAIO showing power on/off switch" class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/switch.jpg" title="Power on/off switch"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That glassy looking button is an on/off switch. It responds to light pressure and it protrudes from notebook even when lid is closed. What could possibly go wrong?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After a while I got tired of my notebook getting turned off while I carried it and made what I believed would be a temporary fix until I figure out something better
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#pimp-notebook-1-note" id="pimp-notebook-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . A cap for button made out of layers of paper for sturdiness (I should at least use paperboard) glued together and reinforced with copious amounts of Scotch tape. It looked ugly, but mostly worked.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem with temporary fixes is that they tend to become permanent. I think this happens when they are too successful and remove too much pain, but it’s hard to find that sweet spot of enough uneasiness without actual aggravation. Maybe it doesn’t even exist.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So I’ve been using it ever since with a firm intention to figure out a better way to fix it. I finally decided to draw what I need and print it at
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.shapeways.com" rel="homepage" title="Shapeways"&gt;
     Shapeways
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#pimp-notebook-2-note" id="pimp-notebook-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Here are results:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="3 switch protectors. Old one made out of paper and two new ones." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/protectors.jpg" title="Switch protectors - old and new"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I made two (left is old paper one), because it takes them a while to print and deliver them to Europe, I had no experience with materials and they are relatively cheap. They also looked better before I sandpapered them somewhat for a better fit. In fact both of them were completely black.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A couple of tips if you intend to use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://sketchup.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google SketchUp"&gt;
     SketchUp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for drawing models. SketchUp was really made for drawing sketches of buildings so when you start it, you’ll see an image of a person (to help you scale your sketch). That image is an object and you have to delete it if you don’t want it to screw up your measurements in exported file. The other consequence of SketchUp purpose is that anything you draw has no depth. This didn’t matter to me since required thickness of protector cylinder was about the same as minimum thickness that 3D printer can print. If this is not true for you, then you’ll probably need to do some post-processing (search Shapeways for tutorials).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My notebook has been “on the road” and has performed admirably apart from a failed battery latch which forced me to now use a lower capacity battery (which still gets me through a typical conference day). But 3 years is forever for wandering notebook so it was no big surprise that frame of its screen eventually cracked. Superglue didn’t fix it and I was thinking about gluing a piece of wood or metal to screen for reinforcement, but I hate the idea of additional weight. It would also look awful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At about same time I was snooping around
    &lt;a href="http://store.mozilla.org/"&gt;
     Mozilla store
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to see if there was something I like which I could buy to support my favorite web project and discovered laptop skins. I was never a fan of covering my laptop with stickers from various startups (why would anyone want that?), but this was perfect. I’m not sure from what kind of material the skins are made of, but they are thin and don’t tear easily. With another layer of Scotch tape I got something that I think looks great and provides enough protection for a now more careful user:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Shows back of notebook with new skin and switch protector attached." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/final.jpg" title="New back of notebook and switch protector"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looks great, right?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="pimp-notebook-1-note"&gt;
     I still find it amazing that this problem wasn’t caught before release.  Eventually they noticed it and later models got buttons that need more pressure to trigger and are better shielded from environment.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E65" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia E65"&gt;
     Nokia E65
    &lt;/a&gt;
    user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900"&gt;
     Nokia N900
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/andraz" title="Andraž's twitter page"&gt;
     Andraž’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    suggestion because I was not happy with  the quality of work done in Slovenia and I thought regular web talks could educate and help raise awareness. Looking back at the state of industry then and where we are now, it is obvious we came a long way and I’d like to think our talks played a part in it. I may be biased, but not that much because I stopped organizing them a long time ago so kudos really goes to
    &lt;a href="http://friedcell.net/home" title="Marko Mrdjenovič - Fry"&gt;
     those who
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DavorinPavlica" title="Davorin Pavlica"&gt;
     followed me
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is still easy to find
    &lt;a href="http://www.zrkv.si/" title="Look at page source if you dare"&gt;
     shoddy work
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but this will never change. You can find it in any field and there is no reason why web should be any different. There is always room for growth, but I am fairly satisfied with Slovenian web development community. These days there is no shortage of interesting events (meetups, hackdays, camps of various kinds) where you can meet kindred spirits, many of whom are doing interesting stuff. I wish there was more open web evangelism, but talks always were what we made them and it’s up to us open web advocates to go out there more often.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand Slovenian UX community depresses me. It seems to be full of people with big egos, very limited knowledge and low self-esteem resulting in an environment where constructive criticism is avoided and learning remains personal and, as community, slow. There are exceptions to this, but right now it seems it is enough to read a couple of books and follow a few related blogs to justify a UX related title on your business card and profess expertise. Critical assessment of problems and approaches is largely missing. There is a difference between cutting corners and skipping all steps — being agile is not a justification for being lazy. Events are rare and online discussions feel limited to regurgitating blog opinions as facts and discussing eternal, but mostly answered questions (e.g. how much of underlying technology do non-developers need to know?).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then again I may be just an old grump. My feelings about UX community are not all that different to what I felt about web development community six years ago and that one turned out OK. Maybe I
    &lt;em&gt;
     am
    &lt;/em&gt;
    just too quick to judge and things will turn out just fine soon enough. We’ll see. See you tonight in

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I attended OpenData hackday previous weekend where we tried to create a website inspired by
    &lt;a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/"&gt;
     theyworkforyou.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . We didn’t quite achieve our goal, but a lot was done by everyone and we had fun. At least I did and I am certain we will release the first version soon (before the end of October, mark my words).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not releasing our website still bothered me and I’ve been thinking about it since, contemplating what we did right and what I did wrong.﻿ I hope this rumination can be of use to others who may be thinking about organizing or attending such an event. If you already have and have some tips to share or simply disagree with something I said, then please leave a comment at the bottom.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Planning
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is
    &lt;a href="http://neoacademic.com/2011/09/22/unfolding-the-ikea-effect-why-we-love-the-things-we-build/" title="IKEA effect"&gt;
     important to finish
    &lt;/a&gt;
    something. Having something at least a bit useful or fun gives everyone involved a sense of achievement and provides a better motivation for further work. To avoid problems with too many ideas started and none finished, we suggested to work only on ideas that have at least 3 volunteers. We also created a wiki where everyone could add their idea and volunteer for projects they liked.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think strongly suggesting at least 3 volunteers per project idea had an effect of ending up with just one idea. Not our intention, nor necessarily a problem, but it’s worth keeping in mind. We all tend to take the path of least resistance when not really committed to an idea and joining is easier than finding an idea AND people to help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However if you do come up with an idea, then here are a few things you might keep in mind:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Self-sustaining projects win.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Even with best intentions you will probably run out of time for your project eventually. So projects that can be finished or which can be run by a community with few development and administration resources are less likely to end in failure.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Strip it to bare essentials
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    , but keep a list of things you’d like to add if you had more time or help. I knew that we couldn’t build theyworkforyou in a day, but my planned version was still too grandiose. I should stop only when removing anything would reduce it to useless. Another reason for this is that I also often overestimate my free time — important for projects that will continue after hackday.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Check if you have data you need
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . First check for completeness, since missing parts might significantly affect feasibility of your project (especially if they are needed for a stripped down version). If you plan to scrap data from a public source (instead of using API or something you already have), then scrape it well before the event. Site may not be available when you need it or, as it was our experience, it can be frustratingly slow. Perception of speed is relative, but downloads can always go slower than even the pessimist in you would make you believe. I learned on hackday that I was planning to use a non-existing data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Check the quality of your data,
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    don’t only glance at it. Spend some time getting to know it and think about how you will clean it up. I knew our data was in an atrocious state, but I was still widely optimistic. Luckily
    &lt;a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/" title="Tomaž's blog"&gt;
     Tomaž
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is a seasoned data wrangler that can deal with crap input.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Have a detailed TODO list
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . Not only will it give you a better picture of scope, it also makes it easier to divide work to unexpected volunteers. Mark what is necessary and what would be nice to have. Also pay attention to skills needed for finishing each task.

    put a lot of effort into our to-do list and I haven’t. We could certainly achieve more if it was clearer what needs to be done and if I could delegate better.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Have a “roadmap”
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . Not every task can be done in parallel so identify and mark task dependencies. It may also be quicker if multiple developers extract different information from the same piece of data then for everyone to wait on one person to extract all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Prepare hosting beforehand.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    If you plan to host a website, then set up
    &lt;em&gt;
     and test
    &lt;/em&gt;
    at least essential parts before the event. Day passes too quickly even if you don’t waste time setting up the environment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Ditto for development environment.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    How many people do you think will or can work on project(s)? Are they all familiar with tools you intend to use? Do you have adequate resources?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I expected time constraints to prevent us from auditing code for exploits, so we opted for bitbucket which gives you private repositories for free. But we had to juggle around its limitation of 5 developers per repository and choice of mercurial as DVCS. Having them private turned out to be unimportant.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So pick tools most are comfortable with and set up your own server (before the event of course) if publicly available options might not be good enough. You want everyone to start contributing as soon and as easily as possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Running event
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our hackday was as open as it gets. We used
    &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/"&gt;
     Eventbrite
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for registration, but didn’t enforce it so everyone who came was welcome no matter how long they stayed. It’s fantastic when people show up offering free help and it would be plain crazy to turn them away. There is always something they can do no matter what their skill set.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here are a few tips I wish I followed:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Lead.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Self-organization is great, but the likelihood of misunderstandings and duplication of effort quickly increases with the size of a group. If you have dependencies in your project roadmap, then it’s also important that showstopper tasks are done before those that rely on them. That’s why someone usually has to lead development and if a project doesn’t have that someone, you either have to find or be him.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Talk to everyone.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Find out what they are doing or what they would like to do. Find out also how long they intend to stay, since that might limit the choice of suitable tasks. Talking is pretty much the only reliable way to find these things out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even better might be to have short group meetings throughout the day for everyone to catch up and I regret I didn’t think of this then. This however doesn’t absolve you from talking, especially if contributors are free to come and go whenever they please as they might have not been around yet the last time you were catching up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Delegate.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    As much as possible to as many as possible. Don’t play a hero trying to do too much. You can always pick another task later or help someone with theirs if you finish too soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In fact it’s probably better to help less experienced members with their tasks than doing whatever you are doing. Having a healthy contributing community is what makes or breaks voluntary projects so nurturing one is even more important than finishing the first version. This goes even more so for projects that can’t ever be really finished.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Morning after
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hackday is over and everyone has gone for a beer. Hopefully everyone is happy with results, but ambitious projects almost by definition can’t be finished in a day and the next morning it was amazing to see people continuing hacking where they left off the day before.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not every hacking community is as engaged as ours. However we all have more or less the same needs. It’s nice to hear our work was appreciated and even better that it mattered. We like to help if we are not alone and if it is clear how. Thus I found email sent by Gašper a few days later a pitch perfect post-hackday message. He first thanked everyone involved, then listed what each and all together achieved and ended by what he intends to do next.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is it. A long, but not exhaustive run through my experience of our last hackday which also took way longer to write than I expected. It’s time to go back to hacking!
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I recently read
    &lt;a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/team/2011/09/12/salary/" title="Link to article about salary"&gt;
     a couple
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/team/2011/09/12/profitsharing/" title="Link to article about profit sharing"&gt;
     of articles
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about employee compensation at
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.balsamiq.com/" rel="homepage" title="Balsamiq"&gt;
     Balsamiq
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It is obvious that they really thought through this problem and came to what is an undoubtedly a generous package. It would be great to hear more about how they use OECD Consumer Price to calculate relative cost of living (since I fail to see how), but what really bothered me was a stated fairness of:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote cite="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/team/2011/09/12/salary/"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     You are paid a little better than someone with your same job in your geographical area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am amazed at how often this view comes up in discussions I have about geographically distributed teams  and I still don’t find it fair. The only argument for it is the free market one. You are paid as little as company can get away with which in general is around average salary. Obviously this approach works only for those who can’t or won’t telecommute to somewhere with a higher salary or can’t find a more appealing environment with about same compensation. At least in our industry this certainly loses you a good chunk of top talent.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A fair compensation should reflect value added by the employee. Two people doing same work and providing same value deserve to be paid equally no matter where they happen to live. It is somewhat hypocritical to price your service based on value provided and fail to do so with service provided to you by your employees.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In essence it is also a judgement on what kind of living standard an employee deserves – about the same as peers around him. Probably alright if you happen to live somewhere like Stockholm and far less impressive in less developed parts of our planet, but fundamentally it is a judgement that shouldn’t be made by employers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For those paid enough to meet existential needs compensation isn’t the most important part of a job or at least it shouldn’t be. It certainly isn’t for me and I doubt Balsamiq employees are unhappy with theirs. I also don’t have a problem working for an organization with such a policy, but I still think it is wrong.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A side note: have you noticed how every author describing their company practices says they are paying slightly above average? Either only people from above average companies write these kind of articles or some of them have to be delusional.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was talking to my wife today about why an “Unknown Source” is becoming the most common source of visits on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://flickr.com" rel="homepage" title="Flickr"&gt;
     Flickr
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . My guess is that it is almost certainly because a
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer" rel="wikipedia" title="HTTP referrer"&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      Referer
     &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    header field is missing in page requests and Flickr is only relying on presence of this piece of data to discern sources. This might have made sense when browsers ruled the web, but we don’t live then anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Simply put referrer field
    &lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.36" title="Link to Referer field definition"&gt;
     can be added
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to request only when request was triggered from source which also has an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" rel="wikipedia" title="Uniform Resource Identifier"&gt;
     URI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    address. Every web page has it since its address is also an URI, but most programs don’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why referrers aren’t missing only from visitors using paranoid browsers or security software that stripped it out of requests, but also when page is visited from a link embedded in emails or instant messages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Requests without referrers used to present a small enough subset of visits that most of us didn’t care. I first noticed this changing when Twitter clients became popular and now there are tons of apps behaving like this. With
    &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/" title="Link to specification"&gt;
     XMLHttpRequest Level 2
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ﻿ even web developers will get a choice of making anonymous requests which won’t include potentially private data like referrers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s nice. I have certainly visited places which I wouldn’t want to share with strangers. But I suspect this is not the common case and most of the time we don’t care telling which page or application sent us there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nobody can precisely predict future so specifications can never be perfect. But I am always amazed when reading core web specs like HTTP’s how insightful their authors were. That most programs don’t have a URI does not mean that they couldn’t. Practically anything can and definitely more things should.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In principle it is possible for each program to have its own address which could be used as referrer
    &lt;em&gt;
     when a better option doesn’t exist
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . I suspect this would be against the spirit of specification, but likely not against its text.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However better options often do exist. Lets take
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://twitter.com" rel="homepage" title="Twitter"&gt;
     Twitter
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as a popular example. Every link that triggers a visit from Twitter was included in at least one tweet and every tweet is also published on web. It might not be accessible to everyone, but it does have an address. I see no reason why that address could not be used as referrer by Twitter clients.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is originating content or its address that interest me, but really, almost anything truthful beats an unknown source. Just knowing name of the service (like Twitter) or app used (e.g. Tweetdeck) would be better than nothing. By the way there is another header field that could provide such insight:
    &lt;em&gt;
     User-Agent
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Sadly it is notoriously unreliable and often missing as well, but that’s another long story.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, if I come back to Flickr. I can’t really tell how much Flickr can or could know. I suspect more than it tells, but I would be astonished if they are not mostly in the dark too. Web was largely built by people too busy (and often too lazy) not to cut corners. Meaning: learning and doing as little as possible to get something to work and sometimes we pay price for our ignorance. But it’s a small price compared to waiting for
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Description of project Xanadu on Wikipedia"&gt;
     Xanadu
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .

   &lt;p&gt;
    After years of personal embarrassment I finally managed to update look and code of my website. This actually happened last week and I wanted to write this post sooner, but
    &lt;a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si" title="Supervizor"&gt;
     other things
    &lt;/a&gt;
    came in-between. There are still bugs I need to fix (iPad footer is better than it was, but not fine), but﻿ overall I’m pretty happy with how it turned out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This was a second site I built using
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/" rel="homepage" title="media queries"&gt;
     media queries
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I learned lots. When I learn a bit more about mobile web, I might write a post about few gotchas for new developers, but this is not that post. This post is about
    &lt;code&gt;
     &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    tag because it bugged me when I made that first design and I spent a remarkable amount of time on it again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My problem with it came down to its definition.
    &lt;code&gt;
     &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    can be used only to mark up contact information about content’s author. In HTML 4 this was limited to authorship of whole page. For HTML5 it
    &lt;a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-address-element" title="Definition of &amp;lt;address&amp;gt; in HTML5 specification"&gt;
     was “widened”
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to authorship of sectioning element like
    &lt;code&gt;
     &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    (so if you have more than one article on page, each can contain its own, different, address for its author). You can’t however mark any address with it and after lots of searching I found
    &lt;a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-February/014023.html" title="Ian's message from February 2008"&gt;
     this old message
    &lt;/a&gt;
    from
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson" rel="wikipedia" title="Ian Hickson"&gt;
     Ian Hickson
    &lt;/a&gt;
    which explains why (I’m not aware of any later clarifications).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t agree with everything said. Mostly correct use is not necessarily a proof of well-designed element. My bet would be that
    &lt;code&gt;
     &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    was a rather unknown tag exactly because of its limited use and was thus used mostly by those that dig deeper into standards, which sound also like people who care  how things are used as expected.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still most points are valid. Loosening definition would make it less meaningful.
    &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" title="Specification of hCard microformat"&gt;
     There
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/adr" title="Specification of adr microformat"&gt;
     are
    &lt;/a&gt;
    microformats that you can use instead and most annoying problems (allowing only inline content) have been fixed. We also have better tools for parsing HTML so  it really doesn’t matter much if its definition feels completely right or not. It’s good enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end I still decided to mark my contact information on
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net"&gt;
     my homepage
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with
    &lt;code&gt;
     &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    anyhow (augmented with
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCard" rel="wikipedia" title="HCard"&gt;
     hCard
    &lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been following subjects of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" rel="wikipedia" title="Gamification"&gt;
     gamification
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics" rel="wikipedia" title="Game mechanics"&gt;
     game mechanics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for a couple of years now, but I’ve only recently spotted how they apply to me. I conceitedly thought that they have little influence on me, but reality is as always more nuanced.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still seem to be unmoved by most attempts. I don’t care that my
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.linkedin.com" rel="homepage" title="LinkedIn"&gt;
     LinkedIn
    &lt;/a&gt;
    profile is not complete and no fake mayorship will get me to use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.foursquare.com/" rel="homepage" title="Foursquare"&gt;
     Foursquare
    &lt;/a&gt;
    until I see some other tangible benefit. On the other hand keeping a list of books and having a goal on how many to read has indeed influenced my behavior.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why did this last example work? Because I actually care about reading books. It’s something I enjoy and want to do more, so “achievements” actually mean something to me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I started to track books I read because I wanted to know how many I actually read, in what order and does that say something about me. I also thought setting an annual goal would provide a good incentive to keep reading, which it did, but not exactly in a way I expected.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having a goal certainly helped me with additional motivation to read books when otherwise I might not have for one reason or another, but it also  gave me a nudge against dropping books I didn’t like since doing so would mean time invested in them would not get counted to achieving my goal.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It also pushed me to thinner books. Less pages mean on average quicker completion. But there are books where six or eight hundred pages doesn’t feel too long and they shouldn’t be postponed just because it might take me more than a couple of weeks to read them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Time pressure also leads to more cursory reading. I’ve never been able to read as deeply as I thought I should, but having a goal definitely changed my reading for the worse. Again, properly engaging a book takes more time and hence makes it harder to achieve the goal.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I didn’t notice any downsides from having a list itself which has indeed provided me with insights about me I probably could have if I wrote a diary. Which I don’t, so I’m left to piecing my long term memories mostly from circumstantial evidence.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why I’m keeping a list, but ditching my goal. Upside is simply not worth the downsides.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I see my experience as providing a lesson. It’s relatively easy to go through different gaming mechanisms and find a combination that you think will give you results you want. However, incentives are a bitch and I think it’s practically impossible to reliably predict what will actually happen in use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why complex modern games take so much time to create, because getting things right takes time and is not something you can reason through.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     her comments
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m skeptical of general awe around gamification, but I do think game mechanics will have an important role to play in our future. Still I would prefer if we cautiously applied new tools where they can’t hurt much before we plaster badges of suck everywhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For a while now I’ve been annoyed by how every gamification talk has about 20 minutes of gushing of its virtues and about 20 seconds on possible ethics problems, but my experience has reminded me of the deeper problem, which is that it is simply much easier to inflict damage to your users and your product (brand) than getting it right.

    We came from
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.corse.fr/" rel="homepage" title="Corsica"&gt;
     Corsica
    &lt;/a&gt;
    vacation recently and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south of the island. It’s a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent an apartment in the old town itself – you might feel as a part of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Typeface used for suggestions was
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans" rel="wikipedia" title="Comic Sans"&gt;
     Comic Sans
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more despised and ridiculed
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" rel="wikipedia" title="Typeface"&gt;
     typefaces
    &lt;/a&gt;
    around. My unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than others.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It obviously doesn’t leave people untouched, since they keep on using it when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers. I’ve also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested in type.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually means) just as it doesn’t make Madonna a good singer. It does however speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply unmoved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn’t designed for.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it’s probably more because it is less general, less bland than, say,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" rel="wikipedia" title="Times Roman"&gt;
     Times Roman
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the end I have to admit I don’t have a bigger point than simple admission I’m not affronted by it anymore. I can’t muster a will to protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end harmless.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A class of bugs I really dislike debugging are those that depend on specific data and affect only a very small subset or just one user. Things could sometimes be fixed so much faster if you could just log in as him to see what is happening. Sometimes this is exactly what we do
    &lt;strong&gt;
     with his explicit permission
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    , but I really dislike asking for passwords.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First it inconveniences user. He has to come up with either a new good password or go through two password changes. Second it implicitly teaches wrong behavior. Passwords simply should never be revealed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That is why I wrote
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/Impostor" title="Impostor's home at GitHub"&gt;
     Impostor
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a Django app that allows staff members (and only them) to login with their own credentials as a different user. Idea is not mine (kudos goes to
    &lt;a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201008/django_superuser_login_trapdoor.html" title="Ned's post where idea comes from"&gt;
     Ned Batchelder
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ), but I like it. To discourage abuse every such authentication is recorded and can be seen in Django admin interface, but can not be altered from there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So how does it work in practice?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lets say that I would need to log in as user
    &lt;em&gt;
     fry
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . To do this I would enter as my username
    &lt;em&gt;
     markos as fry,
    &lt;/em&gt;
    provide my password and voila, I’m him. This has been recorded so anyone with access to ImpostorLog part in admin can see all such cases, mine included.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Impostor may also ease your development by removing need to remember different passwords for testing. This is usually not a problem unless you happen to develop with fake data but real accounts. Like me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And again for morally challenged out there:
    &lt;strong&gt;
     you should never login as somebody else without his explicit permission
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    : Thanks Ross for reminding me where idea came from. I updated text accordingly.

    This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won’t, look forward to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven’t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn’t mean short on value).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Pursuit of Glory
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Your soul will thank you for this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483"&gt;
      Coders At Work
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Peter Seibel. Fascinating look into titans of programming, but you probably have to be a programmer to enjoy reading it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Kate Summerscale
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Amazing book. An intriguing never solved crime gets well researched to the point where it can present a plausible explanation of what happened. Also well written, so it’s hard to imagine being bored.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      A Smile in the Mind
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Beryl McAlhone, David Stuart. A compendium of different ways in which design can delight us. It’s a topic that can’t be distilled in a how-to, but it does come close.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Fixed to Flexible: Four Simple Lessons about Cost, Price, Margin and The Options Available to The 21st Century Business by Todd Sattersten. An ebook I forgotten and hence can’t judge.

      Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Steve Krug. His first book is legendary. Second probably won’t be, but it’s still a very good (and quick) read if you want to learn effective usability testing on cheap.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Designing books: practice and theory
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jost Hochuli, Robin Kinross. A book about book design from a long time practitioner. Great read for us who are into that sort of thing and don’t disdain swiss design, but it’s likely boring to everyone else.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Dan Cederholm. Dan shows how you can use CSS3 today to progressively improve pages. Not quite the same approach as Andy Clarke’s (missing because I read it this year), but they both persuasively teach you to do more today.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       The Crusades through Arab Eyes
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Amin Maalouf
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Title really says all. I started reading this one together with comprehensive tome from western PoV (which I plan to finish in 2011). I can recommend it even to those, who don’t have a particular interest in crusades.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources

      Street Fighting Mathematics
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Sanjoy Mahajan. More involved, but also more general approaches to getting fairly accurate estimates than in Mind Performance Hacks
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto. Don’t know what to think of it, except that translation seems dubious.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Absence of War
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by David Hare
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Great political drama that is still relevant.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483299?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1594483299"&gt;
      The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
     &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

       Too Loud a Solitude
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Bohumil Hrabal
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Everything reviewers said: short, eccentric, playful and…a must read.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387356?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307387356"&gt;
      Master of Shadows: The Secret Diplomatic Career of the Painter Peter Paul Rubens
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Mark Lamster. Insightful and often surprising even for us who knew about his second career.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Pursuit of Glory
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Tim Blanning
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Could be the best history book I’ve ever read and its lingering effect on me might make it also one of most?influential.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883513006?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1883513006"&gt;
      Costa Rica: A Traveler’s Literary Companion
     &lt;/a&gt;
     edited by Barbara Ras. I planned to read this while we travelled around Costa Rica, but failed. I read most of it during our last days on the trip and on our way home. Uneven, with some stories quite good while others resulting in “huh?”, but you do see country differently and I would recommend it to all who plan to travel there.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also discovered
    &lt;a href="http://www.granta.com/"&gt;
     Granta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a really great literary magazine through which you can discover new authors or simply authors you don’t know yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end I would like to mention a book I read this year, so it’s not on the list, but which I find too important to ignore for a year. It’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316069884"&gt;
     Eating Animals
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Jonathan Safran Foer. If you care what you eat and especially if that involves meat, you ought to read it. It’s well researched and even better written book that will inform you what “western” meat production means these days. I don’t think I can recommend it enough.

    I returned from

     Costa Rica
    &lt;/a&gt;
    two days ago after a month spent there. It’s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn’t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote
    &lt;a href="2009-review.html" title="Last year's review"&gt;
     my yearly review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it’s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn’t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess it’s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as

    &lt;/a&gt;
    work anyway.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn’t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won’t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO

    while travelling than last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am more optimistic about next year.

     COP16
    &lt;/a&gt;
    wasn’t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I’ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I
    &lt;a href="sabbatical.html"&gt;
     plan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years…Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133" rel="amazon" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich"&gt;
     4 hour work week
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why
    &lt;sup&gt;
     [
     &lt;a href="#book-1"&gt;
      1
     &lt;/a&gt;
     ]
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    again draws no sympathy from me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So….What do I want?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/" rel="homepage" title="Pixel Qi"&gt;
     Pixel Qi
    &lt;/a&gt;
    will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol style="margin-top:3em"&gt;
    &lt;li id="book-1"&gt;
     You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.

    about importance of

     sabbatical
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I could not agree more.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn’t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don’t, you really ought to find something. I’ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you’ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can – in time and geography. I haven’t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Three months ago I received an invitation to try and review
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://toshl.com" rel="homepage" title="Toshl"&gt;
     Toshl
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a mobile expense tracker developed by
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.3fs.si" rel="homepage" title="ThirdFrameStudios"&gt;
     ThirdFrameStudios
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I also received code to get? Pro account free for first year to help me test it, which saved me a modest amount of 20 euros. It is also not a secret that I know people working at 3fs and admire their work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As influences go, that’s it. I received neither threats to pets I don’t have or contributions to a bank account I do have. Also a complete absence of nudges means that this post took longer than planned and that all opinions are mine. Too make them less ignorant I decided at start to give Toshl a proper test and use it for couple of months before passing judgment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Toshl, as mentioned, is a tool for keeping track of expenses. You are obviously sensible enough to know why this is wise, if you are still reading this, so I won’t bother explaining. It comes as a free application for
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android"&gt;
     Android
    &lt;/a&gt;
    devices and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.maemo.org/" rel="homepage" title="Maemo"&gt;
     Maemo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    based N900. I heard rumors of an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage" title="iPhone 3G"&gt;
     iPhone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    version, but Symbian or
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.blackberry.com/" rel="homepage" title="BlackBerry"&gt;
     BlackBerry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    owners are out of luck (for now). Using web based companion and synchronization is free too, but you have to pay for Pro account if you want to add expenses through website or need a more flexible export of your data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tested Nokia N900 version of Toshl and liked it. I don’t want to go into details since they quickly become boring and there is no better test than your own (remember, it’s free). I was impressed how well it handles
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator" rel="wikipedia" title="Decimal separator"&gt;
     decimal separator
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for me, since I sin by using both comma and point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Entering expenses is easy and quick, especially if you have entered similar recently, since you can reuse tags just by clicking on suggested. You also see already entered expenses sorted by time or tags. There is still room for improvement (like adapting tags suggestions based on first entered), but not much to fault.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe Toshl’s goal is to be as simple and fun tracker of everyday expenses as possible. You can do basic add and removal of expenses, export inserted data, categorize each entry with tags and see few different reports. That’s it. There is no integration with banks, currency conversions,? or even a notion of income. Reports are basic and I am not a fan of those included.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I usually used more than one tag on each expense and had difficulty wrapping my head around graphs where same expense could be shown multiple times. I failed at judging how much impact do some expenses have overall without at least some tweaking of graphs. I am certain that Tufte would call it chartjunk, but their implementation certainly is fun to play with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And that’s where Toshl’s main strength is. A fun way of doing something that most people find incredibly tedious. You might overgrow it one day and switch, but it will help you develop a necessary habit of recording your expenses.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Being simple and fun doesn’t mean powerless. Tags free you to your own categorization and multiple export options give you an opportunity to massage that data further in tools of your choice. It might not be as trivial as clicking on a graph is, but doing it in Excel is not much harder.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I will not continue to use it because I am that sort of person who gets off on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" rel="wikipedia" title="Double-entry bookkeeping system"&gt;
     double-entry bookkeeping
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’ve been using
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.gnucash.org/" rel="homepage" title="GnuCash"&gt;
     GnuCash
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for years and there is no easy way to sync data with it (probably shouldn’t be either) and few reasons to input every expense twice. I do recommend anyone who isn’t tracking yet or is not satisfied with his current approach to give Toshl a try.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And if you are happy with free version, then buy a Pro account. It costs little, gives you features as polished as rest of service and it help secure your apps future.

     Joshua Porter’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that’s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" rel="homepage" title="Facebook Connect"&gt;
     Facebook Connect
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as Facebook “owning” their users.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They are right, but it doesn’t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Awareness -&amp;gt; Sign-up -&amp;gt; First-time use -&amp;gt; Engagement -&amp;gt; Referral
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    …) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It’s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to “full” members to make such commitment more enticing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I’ll let you know how it went.

    April is about to end and with it also the deadline to
    &lt;a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/"&gt;
     submit your EuroPython talk
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I thought about submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my current workload.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not) Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality. It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had to miss last year, feels like home.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why I decided to volunteer this year. It’s a way to give a little bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So do submit your talk and come. It won’t be the same without you.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I admire the look and feel of
    &lt;a href="http://www.mikematas.com/"&gt;
     Mike Matas’ new website
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It is really well thought through. I was also intrigued by how he did it, especially after getting a pop-up on my first visit advising me to use a more modern browser than a recent version of Firefox.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no point in speculating why some of its features don’t work in more browsers. But I was surprised to see that blurred images are served that way and don’t get blurred in browser. I am playing with an idea of implementing a gallery inspired by Mike’s work, but I would like to reduce manual labor needed for maintaining it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So I wrote a function that blurs an image on canvas. You can
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/canvas_blur/" title="Javascript blur demo page"&gt;
     see it in action
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or copy its code, if you find it useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The algorithm used is described in
    &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060718054020/http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/siggraph/workshops/wjarosz_convolution_2001.pdf" title="Link to PDF version of paper"&gt;
     2001 paper
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Wojciech Jarosz. Page contains two implementations, second trading algorithm purity for in my opinion nicer code. Increase number of passes or run it few times over an image, if you need a blurrier result.? Please ask, if you need help with its use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also measured its speed to see if it fits my needs. That brought a new surprise. Firefox 3.5.8? on my Linux powered VAIO with 1.2GHz processor blurs image twice as fast as same browser on a Mac with a 2.8Ghz processor. Numbers between runs may vary slightly, but never much. No idea why this is happening, since all functions do is some basic math over items in array that should be well optimized everywhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am sure somebody can optimize it further, but I find it good enough for my use. Image isn’t very blurred after one pass, but one pass over a small image is also a good way to measure how fast a particular computer-browser combination is. On fast combinations I might go for multiple passes over images in view, but fall back to a single pass or no pass on slower systems.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I love using
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/" rel="homepage" title="N900"&gt;
     N900
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but there are applications or features I miss. This post is a reminder to me on what I might do if I find more time. Since list is too long for me to do everything (unless I suddenly win lottery), feel free to pick an idea you like and run with it. Just let me know afterwards where I can see results of your work or participate in development.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Offline Wikipedia.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    When I am not behind a computer or reading, I like to be outdoors and even though cheap always available Internet was supposed to be here any day now, I regularly find myself information hungry in places with a very slow or no Internet connection. N900 with SD card could pretty much store everything I wanted and building an app that process and display information from
    &lt;a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/" title="Wikipedia dumps starting page"&gt;
     Wikipedia dumps
    &lt;/a&gt;
    doesn’t look like a too difficult task.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Better dictionary for Maemo.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    QStarDict port
    &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    is great and it has become one of my favorite applications. However its user interface suffers from being a direct port of a desktop version one and could be improved with one that wastes less space and is orientation aware. Reading dictionary is one of few things I wish I could do in portrait mode.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Web platform for Maemo.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Wouldn’t it be great if you could build Maemo applications with web technologies?
    &lt;a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qtwebkit.html" title="Link to QtWebKit documentation"&gt;
     QtWebKit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is a great place to start and I am certain I could expose new functionality through
    &lt;em&gt;
     addToJavascriptWindowObject
    &lt;/em&gt;
    of
    &lt;a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwebframe.html" title="Link to QWebFrame documentation"&gt;
     QWebFrame
    &lt;/a&gt;
    class. Beside exposing this stuff I would also like to create tools and interfaces for developers and users alike with which they can easily package a web application as a standalone Maemo application or in case of users, turn a website into an application (I know you can add a bookmark to a website but it is not quite the same thing).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/" title="Caffeine for Mac"&gt;
      Caffeine
     &lt;/a&gt;
     for N900.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    I would like to pick
    &lt;em&gt;
     “Switch profile to silent for &amp;lt;x time&amp;gt;”
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and know N900 will turn back normal profile when that time period expires. I always forget to turn ringing back on after I leave cinema.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Monitor unknown calls.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    I don’t want to pollute my address book with every phone number under the sun, but I would appreciate if I could get a hint if I ever talked or called the number in question. Bonus points for using public phone books to fetch name for given number and parsing number for clues (which country or part of it is call coming from).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is not a complete list of things I want, but rest are mostly feature requests (except email client which currently really kind of sucks). For example I wish calendar had support for
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" rel="wikipedia" title="CalDAV"&gt;
     CalDAV
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or PDF viewer for screen rotate, search and fit to width.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am aware that Maemo should be called MeeGo now, but a habit of years can’t be changed in few weeks. I searched for above applications and didn’t find them, but if you know of any I missed, then please let me know.

    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    widget has always been to present contextually relevant information to text being written and to enable writers to add that information easily in places of their choice. We want to do this in as unobtrusive manner as possible, which means that act of writing should not be impeded by us and that published text should only have as little markup added as it is necessary to add items picked by user  (images, links…).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Zemanta widget in various incarnations today works in all major browsers (
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="homepage" title="Firefox"&gt;
     Firefox
    &lt;/a&gt;

     Safari
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.opera.com" rel="homepage" title="Opera Software"&gt;
     Opera
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) and on all major blogging platforms. This wide support is presenting ever bigger challenge to us  and to anyone who wants to follow our path.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most blogging platforms today support enhancement of blogs with widgets. I think it is time for them to add support for widgets on content creation side and go beyond current one-interface-fits-all state of affairs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Open platform would enable tool makers like us to build specialized tools that might cater to specific niches and empower writers to customize their workflow to their needs .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Such platforms should at minimum have a common shared feature set, but I hope for at least partially shared
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" rel="wikipedia" title="Application programming interface"&gt;
     API
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Current state
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Some platforms like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://wordpress.org" rel="homepage" title="WordPress"&gt;
     WordPress
    &lt;/a&gt;
    already have a plug-ins API which can be used to customize parts of creation process. However it is usually very low level, highly platform specific and available only to self-hosted users.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Creators of rich text editors have also recognized a need to let outside developers extend writing experience. Most major editors have an API that admittedly we might not be using enough. But this is not true of all editors so we end up with common development problems like not enough feature overlap and missing,  undocumented or poorly documented interfaces.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is a lot of activity, but the end result is still a very fragmented landscape that in my opinion limits developers creativity. You either add wanted functionality to your favorite platform or if you are more ambitious, you end up seeking the right balance between ironing out  platform peculiarities and building features users actually care about.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And since blogging environment that most people use lets them little control over it, we develop browser extensions that are really just a patch for this problem. The only reason why we bloat browsers (a little bit) with an extension that most of the time does nothing is because we have to. Extensions are great, but they also present a risk and in this case one that should not be necessary.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     My vision of future
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I would like to do as a developer can best be explained with examples translated from code to English (well, approximation of it anyhow).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would like to write: ?Take image at this address, upload it to writer?s image repository and return me its new address.?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would like to write: ?When DOM node is added to text (or removed from it), run this function.?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would like to write: ?Before text is published, run it through this filter function and save its result.?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would like to write: ?Store this information and let me retrieve when I need it.?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would like our users to add our widget with only a few clicks. Maybe a click on our side to trigger installation and a confirmation on blogging platform with a list of permissions sought (like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://oauth.net" rel="homepage" title="OAuth"&gt;
     OAuth
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When user interface needs to be shown, I would want it to be well integrated. So if elements of interface can be rearranged, hidden or otherwise handled, then our widget would behave as expected.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     In conclusion
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Creating and supporting a tool like Zemanta is difficult. Front end development is challenging enough when you are against few browsers on your platform, but it is far worse when you try to deliver the same high level of experience on multiple platforms none of which you actually control.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You keep hitting at browser quirks and unexpected platform changes and ironically it keeps getting worse as other people?s code gets better. For example, wrapping your Javascript code in anonymous namespace is good practice, but it often removes hooks on which you relied and you need to come up with a new solution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My work often feels like war of attrition, which is odd because there is no enemy. We work to complement blogging platforms, not replace them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Surely it is time we do better.

Many have wrote theirs, so I doubt I will be telling anything really new. Before I go on, a short disclaimer, since my writings on this blog stay around longer than might be sensible.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I wrote this post at the start of February 2010. I believe everything I write about technology to be hopelessly out of date after 6 months, but I expect this article will be obsolete even sooner. So by the time you got around reading this, most of my gripes might not even be true anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900"&gt;
     Nokia N900
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is an uncut diamond. A wonderful thing made by talented designers that has quite a few rough edges, not all of them in device. I wouldn’t recommend it to most people, but to some of you it might become your favorite computer. It goes with me almost anywhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you want a rock solid phone, then this device is not for you. I was unlucky to be in minority of people who experienced constant reboots. By constant I mean few times every hour.? My
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia"&gt;
     Nokia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    also lacked a 2GB partition, which meant I was constantly running out of space in which to install applications. Both of this problems have since been fixed. I still have a problem with
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM" rel="wikipedia" title="GSM"&gt;
     GSM
    &lt;/a&gt;
    connection occasionally completely dying, which I can fix only by manual reboot. I’m personally not bothered since I don’t use it as phone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand updates to software are regular, with one major firmware update already, that fixed some of my problems (reboot). Annoyances of today might literally be gone by tomorrow and thus my disclaimer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I know how much effort goes in good software and don’t want to be too negative, but email really does suck for IMAP users. Not only doesn’t it cache headers, so if you have a slow connection and a big Inbox, get used to waiting. You also can’t set sent mail, drafts or trash folders which makes it useless to me for anything but reading email. Even worse, it creates its own folders (like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch"&gt;
     iPod touch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) to make a mess in your account. I am all for simplicity and avoiding needless configuration options, but it could at least get a list of folders and compare Levenshtein’s distance to common names (Sent, Sent mail…).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Gecko (Mozilla) based browser though is great, in my opinion much better than iPod’s and I completely switched my mobile browsing to N900. I am biased since unlike many I never was fond of constant zooming in and out (with pinching). My opinion might have been different if my eye-sight was poorer and I needed to zoom more.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are a Linux user or appreciate freedom, then it’s difficult to find a better mobile device. N900 is a Linux machine which happens to also be a phone and you have complete access to everything. There is a store (Ovi) and app manager, but you can install and run anything willing to run without permission from anybody. Terminal is loaded by default together with tools needed to prod into the system and root is one package installation away.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I dislike fixed space of iPod. N900 is only slightly better. You can expand it with SD cards, but you have to open battery cover. It looks so fragile that I don’t intend to actually do this unless absolutely necessary. Speaking of storage, as a programmer I can understand why applications can use only 2GB of it, but as user it simply looks daft.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Pair of contact and conversations applications is absolutely brilliant. Instant messaging, Skype and SMS are superbly integrated and they also feed contact application with information about your buddies found on those networks.? Install Hermes and you can update it with data from Twitter and Facebook.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Screen has higher resolution than iPod’s, but physically same (small) size, which means I’ll keep reading PDFs on my 770. Since it’s resistive instead of capacitive, it needs more pressure than iPod’s, but works better at -12 degrees centigrade (
    &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/4268784785/" title="French Alps - photo taken by N900"&gt;
     this picture
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was taken with my gloves on).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Maemo has a very active and generally supportive community, but some members can also be
    &lt;a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6334#c19"&gt;
     needlessly unfriendly
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Just because you know where everything is and have seen certain faux pas 100 times before, it doesn’t mean either is true for a new N900 owner with a problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    N900 RUNS PYTHON, which was my main reason for preferring it over an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android"&gt;
     Android
    &lt;/a&gt;
    phone. Documentation is a bit all over the place, not always current and I still haven’t found information about how to control built in cameras, but I am an optimist that this will be sorted out soon and that documentation will improve as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I compared N900 with diamond, but maybe a better comparison would be a sports car. If you want a polished, sedated experience then N900 is certainly not for you (yet). But if you are a tinkerer who doesn’t mind rough edges in exchange for freedom to make it do almost anything, then you should give it a spin.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is so much more that could be said, but big picture wouldn’t change much. I haven’t talked much about UI since I simply couldn’t do it justice in few sentences. On the whole it works fine and multitasking is really great even though I think iPhone/iPad’s switch-to-where-you-were model is in my experience rarely a problem and wouldn’t be surprised if it was here to stay.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If there is anything about it you would like to know, then please ask and I’ll try to respond to it promptly.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I had a crazy dream, where I was back at University, but this time studying computer science. We were writing a function to calculate an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean" rel="wikipedia" title="Arithmetic mean"&gt;
     arithmetic mean
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of an array of numbers. A task obviously too simple for college course, but with dreams you get what you are given.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Discussion started with this function:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol class="code"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      function average(arr) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      var i, sum = 0;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      for(i=0;i&amp;lt;arr.length;i++) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      sum += arr[i];
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      return sum/i;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="download"&gt;
     Download this code:

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Dream me, who by the way is significantly more bitchy than I ever am, wasn’t pleased and thought he could save few bytes by storing counter and sum inside of the array:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol class="code"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      function average(arr) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1 cmnt"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      // Store counter in array[0] and sum in array[1]
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      if (arr.length &amp;lt; 3) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      return arr.length == 2 ? arr[0]+arr[1] : arr[0];
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      } else {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      arr[1] = arr[0]+arr[1];
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      arr[0] = 2;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      for(;arr[0]&amp;lt;arr.length;arr[0]++) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab3"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      arr[1] += arr[arr[0]];
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;

      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      return arr[1]/arr[0];
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This looked ugly, but what bothered him (me?) was more that it also had a bug. Integer in
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="wikipedia" title="JavaScript"&gt;
     Javascript
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is limited to 2
    &lt;sup&gt;
     53
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    , which is a lot, but sum can still
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow" rel="wikipedia" title="Arithmetic overflow"&gt;
     overflow
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or underflow it. Since mean can never be smaller than smallest or bigger than biggest number in a list, I could fix it by writing:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol class="code"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      function average(arr) {

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      while (arr.length) {
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab2"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      sum += arr.pop()/n;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="tab1"&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      return sum;
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;code&gt;
      }
     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="download"&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    End of dream. Everything edited for sanity and brevity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t have much to say about second program except that I would never write something so ugly just to save 16 bytes in a function like this. I wouldn’t even use Javascript if memory was that important.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am more intrigued by third program. Bug in second is definitely there, even though few of us operate with numbers big enough to encounter it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s interesting, because if I was awake, I would probably never think of it. I used to worry about bugs like this all the time, when I was coding in C. It was an unavoidable consequence of the language.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess what I am getting at is that it is nice to code in a high-level language and for the most part not think about implementation details like this, but only as long as you actually know them so your brain gets triggered when they matter. Speaking of details, I bet those divisions can cause rounding errors.

     Aaron Swartz’s review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of books and thought it was a great idea that I should copy. I don’t know why exactly. Maybe to better track how much I actually read. Or using a goal to promote more reading when I felt I haven’t read enough. Maybe it was just to learn what topics drew me particular year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Who knows? Probably all of these reasons played a role.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My private goal was to read a book every fortnight, so about 26 in total. I read 37, some of which admittedly very light in content or girth.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Time to present the books, listed in chronological order. I linked those I liked and set in bold those I recommend. Unlinked were either bad or intended for someone I can’t relate to.
   &lt;/p&gt;

      Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Adam Greenfield. Really late to the party with this one, but still a good and fairly unbiased treatise on intelligent tools and environments and problems related to them.

       Ender’s Game
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Orson Scott Card
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . As good as people say.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       Small Gods
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Terry Pratchett
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . In my opinion still the best book by Terry.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1932111972"&gt;
      A Theory of Fun for Game Design
     &lt;/a&gt;

       Aid and Other Dirty Business: How Good Intentions Have Failed the World’s Poor
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Giles Bolton
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Excellent when looking at facts of aid “business” (first 4/5 of the book). Weak when it comes to solutions with seemingly unlimited faith in globalism and power of a consumer.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345460626?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0345460626"&gt;
      The Caryatids
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Bruce Sterling. Interesting and occasionally excellent, but a bit of a let down compared to some of his other work.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123740371?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0123740371"&gt;
      Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design

      &lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Roberto Bolano

     . Discovered by method of pulling random books from shelves in book store. Absolutely superb.

      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Peter L. Bernstein
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . A book about history of risk management made only more relevant by last financial crisis. Fun and very informative.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Lawrence Sterne
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Hard to believe that 250 years old novel can feel so modern.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061161705?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061161705"&gt;
       Unseen Academicals
      &lt;/a&gt;

      Prototyping: A Practitioner’s Guide
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Todd Zaki Warfel. I never got around writing review of this book. Definitely worth a read for practitioners.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596155514?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596155514"&gt;
      Getting Started with Arduino

      The City: A Global History
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Joel Kotkin. Sort of a short introduction to history of cities with everything good and bad that format entails. Excellent starting point for those interested in its subject.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wish I read as much as Aaron (

     latest review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ), who seems to devour about hundred books per year, but I don’t think I’ll ever manage that. My goal for this year is going to be about same, 25 books before bells toll midnight on 31st of December. It still is an ambitious goal, since these days I seem to have a penchant for buying tomes at least 600 page thick and want to read more of other people’s code.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Recently, for a moment, I couldn’t imagine myself working on web in ten years time. Since I am quite passionate about it and its development, the obvious question was why?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Why wouldn’t I want to be a web developer anymore?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Popularity of Facebook comes to mind. It is no secret that I am not a fan of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage" title="Facebook"&gt;
     Facebook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and similar networks. Yet I do have an account there and on some of its brethren. By the way, my Facebook account is for testing purposes, so if I haven’t befriended you, it almost certainly wasn’t personal.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Anyhow, Facebook and ilk are easy to criticize. Anything of that size will certainly gain much to be critical about. I also sometimes feel nostalgic about old web, before the gold rush of last millennium. That too probably says more about my age than anything else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After some pondering I came to conclusion that I am longing for a sense of openness, equality and control I used to have. Few of us had our own server, but in principle with investment of little time and a bit more money, you could run all services that mattered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Few actually did, since on the whole we didn’t do much. We do more now, some of which we don’t want public. I may not like Facebook’s walled garden of information, but I would have to be mad to argue for open access to all that private information. Even with existing restrictions in place people tend to trip and reveal? information to unintended audience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If sharing our lives is what we want to do, which clearly is the case, then rise of brokers like Facebook feels as an unavoidable consequence. However that doesn’t mean natural development of a domineering agent should also be welcomed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If at some point Facebook becomes a conduit for most of our digital lives, what happens if they revoke our account? To whom can we appeal? Who has access to the history of all our actions and what happens to it if we do decide to leave? Is it ever really gone? How do we know that our answers to this questions are true?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a clich? that technology is changing societies faster then they are able to adapt. It is a clich?, but that doesn’t make it wrong. We are changing long before we are able to understand what those changes will bring down the road. It can be argued either way, but it is your outlook on world that will largely form your opinion on desirability of end result.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not an optimist.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like building things and I enjoy it even more when others use them too. I am sometimes lazy and perpetually busy, so I avoid building things which not even I asked for. I always tried to incorporate a reasonable amount of security in services I have built, but I have never added transparency and accountability to the system without outside pressure. I don’t know many who would and that pressure tends to come from legal requirements. It’s a subject too dull to care about without painful personal experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another reason for uneasiness comes from the other side of web connection – web browsers. Last few years have brought an incredible amount of development and most of us aren’t well acquainted with new technologies yet.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5" rel="wikipedia" title="HTML 5"&gt;
     HTML5
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , CSS3 and Javascript will trounce Flash and Silverlight, right?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They might, but they all might not matter. Two raising trends I find interesting are
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web" rel="wikipedia" title="Mobile Web"&gt;
     mobile web
    &lt;/a&gt;
    access and mobile application platforms.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage" title="iPhone"&gt;
     iPhone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android"&gt;
     Android
    &lt;/a&gt;
    have more than 100 000 applications between them and my impression of these ecosystems is that many of them are not much more than platform specific clients to web services. Even if most of them might not have much to do with web (games, books…), it’s not difficult to imagine a future, where most of us would access web through mobile devices and developing native clients for a new service would have a priority over access through browser.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t say this would necessarily be a bad thing, since web development can be quite messy and frustrating. It probably would be less egalitarian and less sharing environment and I would certainly miss that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end of this long self-indulgent post I confess I have no answers. I barely have questions and I had to write this far to get to them. It is for me the most introspective part of the year, so I might be thinking about a non-issue. Time will tell. Eventually.

    &lt;img alt="Peanut butter on a slice of bread" class="image" height="266" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/3/oJO6QdbUC6XJcZNqv-CJzcg1JlI.jpg" width="400"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If this doesn’t look to you like the best peanut butter ever, look again. And again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Before I go on describing how I make peanut butter, let me spend a moment or two talking about why. After all it can be bought in practically any grocery store in Slovenia and visiting a few will even give you a limited selection. My first reason was to limit my intake. Peanut butter is incredibly delicious, but not exactly healthy and since I noticed that how much I eat is proportional to amount available, I wanted to avoid 350g jars that would be the death of me. My second reason was to have a better control of what goes in it. Like with sausages you can’t really tell what was used and in what condition it was. I certainly didn’t want to eat hydrogenated fat
    &lt;a class="reference" href="#pbutter-1" id="pbutter-1-back" title="Link to first footnote"&gt;
     &lt;sup&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/sup&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    added to your stock? peanut butter and were suspicious of a thick layer of oil on top of organic ones too. When I got better at making it, I also found out I really dislike bought ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As it happens the only thing that is absolutely necessary to make peanut butter are peanuts themselves. However you will probably want to use some oil, a sweetener like sugar or
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup" rel="wikipedia" title="Maple syrup"&gt;
     maple syrup
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and salt.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I use roasted peanuts. You can buy already roasted (but unsalted) or roast them yourself. To do that you heat up your oven to 175? C and put them in until they are done to your liking. Turn them around every couple of minutes so they don’t get burned. Next step: chopping.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But first a side note to all my American friends. Reports that Slovenians don’t eat peanut butter are simply false. We just hide it well. It’s kind of like masonry, but instead of discreet regalia and a secret handshake, we, peanut butter connoisseurs, recognize each other by a subtle nutty odor and small brownish stains in corners of lips. Slightly crazy and distracted look in presence of a peanut butter jar might also be a hint.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, chopping. For small amounts, 200g or less, I use a hand blender with chopper accessory. I also use it because it’s the only blender I own. It tends to overheat and since I melted its predecessor my chopping amounts to mostly waiting pierced with short chopping episodes. Bigger blenders are certainly more resilient, but they also tend to have their blades raised higher from the bottom which makes them unpractical for chopping small amounts of nuts. Spend enough time doing this and dust will turn into a fudge-like paste. Do it more and it will become more liquid. If you like to spread butter thick, it might be even liquid enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t so I add a bit of oil. I use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_oil" rel="wikipedia" title="Peanut oil"&gt;
     peanut oil
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but any edible with neutral flavor will work fine, just don’t add too much. You can always add more if you find butter too thick, but it is difficult to correct too liquid one. I add about a tablespoon of oil for 200g of peanuts while they are still pulverized and rarely need to add more later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On recent vacation in Nepal I also tried their peanut butter. It tastes very much like ours at this stage; right taste but like most food in Nepal not salty enough for western taste.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Salt is not the only thing missing. Peanut butter is like tomato sauce, it needs a bit of sugar to get a more well rounded flavor. I used powdered sugar with some success, but maple syrup recently won me over (a tip from
    &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alesspetic" title="Ale? ?peti? on twitter"&gt;
     Ale?
    &lt;/a&gt;
    whose many culinary talents include baking
    &lt;a href="http://tweetphoto.com/cxyahdo1" title="Pumpkin cake"&gt;
     great cakes
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ). How much salt and sugar to use is again down to personal preference. I use about 1-2 teaspoons of maple syrup and slowly salt while mixing until I am satisfied with result. Blender warms butter and spoils tasting somewhat, so I stop spicing butter when it is a bit less sweet and slightly more salted then I would prefer. This results in just the right taste when cooled.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s it. You should now have peanut butter good enough for gods. A few tries, to find the right balance between ingredients and you will end up with one fit for you too. It took me longer because I also eat it with spoon, hence it’s easier to notice its mistakes and more difficult to balance different uses (I prefer more salty butter on bread).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My next goal: cashews and cocoa spread.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="#pbutter-1-back" id="pbutter-1" title="Jump back to reference"&gt;
     [1]
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Hydrogenated fat is used for the same reason as oil, to make butter easier to spread. Added oil doesn’t actually react with peanuts and if you leave your butter long enough, it will eventually separate and form that unwanted oily layer on top.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation" rel="wikipedia" title="Hydrogenation"&gt;
     Hydrogenation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    solidifes fat and prevents that from happening. Downside is that you can’t tell how much additional fat was added unless it is specified in ingredients list and it’s even more unhealthy.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Dear job seeker,
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A job opening is an odd thing, because everyone involved is a buyer and a seller. You are trying to sell yourself to my company while at the same time I am trying to sell us to you and others we might regrettably have to turn down this time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Two months spent actively searching for a new member of our team (we found him this week) made me reflect on the whole process. I am
    &lt;a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/2009/08/14/hiring-developers-king-of-the-hill-effect/"&gt;
     not the only one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I sympathize
    &lt;a href="http://www.worldlandtrust.org/news/2009/07/how-not-to-apply-for-conservation-job.htm"&gt;
     with everyone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    going through this. In last few years I have read tens if not a hundred of job applications and interviewed tens of applicants for different Slovenian IT companies, mainly startups. Not enough to be an expert, but enough to provide me with a firm opinion that most applications sent sucked.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That doesn’t mean that you personally suck, but I feel comfortable saying that most of you do not know how to present yourselves well. Mind you most companies are failing at this too, but this post will be long enough even as I limit myself to just one side of the story. My intent is to provide a maximum amount of help with a minimum amount of venting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it is a safe assumption that you sent an application because you wanted this job. It should also be obvious that we were looking for someone that we think we’ll be able to entrust with challenging tasks and has a personality that won’t turn our jobs into a punishment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So the question you should pose yourself is: “
    &lt;strong&gt;
     What kind of person is the company looking for and how do I best show to be him?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    ” (or her)
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you don’t know, then look for information until you do. Ask if necessary, since any company worth working for doesn’t mind answering them. But knowing this is absolutely crucial if you want to be persuasive and at the same time not needlessly wasting your time on a company that doesn’t fit you. If you still think our company is right place for you, and I hope you do, then you should make sure that everything you do when communicating with us tells us that you are THE person we want to hire.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First and foremost,
    &lt;strong&gt;
     read and follow job ad instructions
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . Seriously, you would not believe how many applications fail to follow even most basic requests. Ask a friend to double check after you if necessary so you won’t miss anything.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is an international company and much of our communication has to be in English and yet, when we asked for applications to be sent in English, majority of them weren’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     If something is unclear, ask for clarification
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . Responding to a job ad is the first test of your ability to receive a task, gather missing information and perform it to expected (agreed) level. Ignoring requirements or reinterpreting instructions on your own will make us doubt you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Send resume when asked for, but don’t think it can substitute things that were asked for. It is amazing how many people just send their resume, when ad explicitly said we would like to see examples of work above everything.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having said that, resume (
    &lt;a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001eddc2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9" rel="wikipedia" title="R?sum?"&gt;
     CV
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) is definitely an asset when trying to sell yourself. When you write, keep in mind that its purpose is to sell you to a company. Put yourself into my shoes and think what should you write there, that is truthful and will make me want to hire you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Europass resume is something only a bureaucrat could love
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . We won’t hold it against you, since somebody probably misinformed you of its usefulness, but it does tell us almost nothing about you. Even if I knew all listed companies, I couldn’t tell from a job title what you actually did there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Much better is to explain in couple of sentences under every job list item what you achieved there and if necessary why I should care about this (e.g.
    &lt;em&gt;
     At company ACME I introduced automated testing of Javascript code that reduced bugs reported by 30%
    &lt;/em&gt;
    )
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a fast moving industry like IT there is probably little reason to go into details about what you did in 1999, unless you are certain it is still relevant today. I started my career in 1997 porting backup agents to new UNIX platforms, but nobody would hire me for such work today (and probably shouldn’t then either). Old job listings are mainly used as a signal for steadfastness.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Don’t embellish resume too much
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . It is impossible to impartially judge your skills and most reviewers expect resumes to be, well, somewhat too rosy. Still, keep things at least defensible. Think what would happen if you were invited to an interview and found out that a part of it is a lie. How much weight do you think the rest of your resume would carry afterwards? Would you trust integrity of such person?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Considering what I said so far about poor quality of most applications, you might think it is easy to get to interview, but it is not necessarily so. There can be external factors that might work against you so sometimes even otherwise promising candidates have to be turned down (e.g., it is easier to teach people who live near by).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s say now that you were interesting enough that we want to conduct an interview with you. I think following tips should work well for you on most occasions. If they don’t, count yourself lucky not to work there. I am not joking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Don’t bluff.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    It’s reasonable to assume that I wouldn’t ask you a question I didn’t know the answer to so it’s unlikely it would work. Good questions can’t be tersely answered so you can’t really hide anyway.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Admit when you don’t know the answer.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    True, knowing it would be better, but at least you are not wasting my time. It’s especially important in small companies that problems are found out as soon as possible and it is a positive sign that you are a person that we can trust to let us know about them when there is still time to do something.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Don’t just give up.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    We all encounter problems that we can’t solve and interview questions we don’t know answers to. Show initiative and think out loud how you see the problem and what solutions might be. Give us a chance to see how you think and persuade us that you are a tenacious problem solver that won’t unnecessarily seek help of others.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Speak to the point
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    and
    &lt;strong&gt;
     be active
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . From my experience this is a problem more prevalent in Slovenia. It quickly becomes annoying and tiresome trying to get a direct answer to a question from a person who doesn’t want to give you one. Making me feel like I have to work to keep interview moving is probably not the best way to leave a good impression.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Skills are…needed.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    We all want to hire people who fit our needs perfectly. We rarely can. What happens next depends on company and people involved, but judging by my experience, we value person over his skill. If choice comes between a flaky or otherwise non-solid person with better skills and someone that couples ability to solve problems and thirst for knowledge with personal integrity and maturity, then it is likely that latter will be chosen.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Ask questions.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Inquisitiveness is always a turn on, but interview is also a chance for you to find more about us. Most companies expect from you an investment of 8 hours of your life daily and if you are like me, then it should be important to you what kind of company and people are you dealing with, what work entails and how do we go about it. Personally I don’t mind questions about salary and benefits, but I do find it odd if interview starts with them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regretfully interview is a last stop for some candidates and we have to turn them down. I know some companies have a bad habit of turning people down without letting them know and if that happens to you, well, count yourself lucky. At Zemanta we find such behavior rude and we notify everyone. What happens afterwards is usually….nothing. No reply.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My advice to you would be to respond with a note thanking for the opportunity. It probably won’t make a difference in a short run, but it does leave a good impression. We are all more inclined to recommend (or hire in next round) people we like.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Good luck!
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’ve been too busy lately and many things suffered as a consequence, writing being one of them. This is not a complaint, since I mostly had fun doing what I did, but it is becoming obvious that too much fun can kill you too. Anyhow, this is not a post discussing woes many would love to have. It’s a short list of ideas and thoughts that occurred to me recently, which I don’t have time to really think through or didn’t want to commit to

    Today? or tomorrow, depending on where you happen to live, is 40 years since

     Neil Armstrong
    &lt;/a&gt;
    became first among few who stepped on moon. When I was a kid, there was nothing I wanted more than becoming an astronaut. Closest I ever got to this dream was having fun at

     Euro Space Center
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t regret this, because I have a great job. It still feels a privilege to work at

    and that is why I’m happy to say that
    &lt;a href="http://www.zemanta.com/jobs/" title="Job ad"&gt;
     we are looking for a frontend developer
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to strengthen our team.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We are searching for someone well versed with Javascript in modern browsers that wants to learn and we can learn from. Working in startup requires ability in having fun with unexpected challenges, but does not mean you will be overworked. We believe that rested developers are more creative and productive and practice what we believe in. In exchange we’ll try to be as flexible as possible to meet your (other) needs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, if you are a developer with even an inkling of a wish to work in a company like ours, please consider
    &lt;a href="http://www.zemanta.com/jobs/" title="Job ad"&gt;
     applying
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . You can also leave any question you might have in comments and I’ll try to answer it to the best of my abilities.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been six months since I wrote
    &lt;a href="dancing-on-titanic.html"&gt;
     my gloomy outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and unlike most things I wrote, my thoughts keep coming back to it and issues I talked about. My view hasn’t changed. 2009 is indeed shaping to be a great year for me and an awful one for world in general.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If a problem like over-fishing, that is both well-understood and has known and relatively cheap solutions, seems to be beyond our willingness to solve, what chance do we have then to find and implement solutions for problems that require enormously more effort and resources?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.ugotrade.com/2009/02/27/towards-a-newer-urbanism-talking-cities-networks-and-publics-with-adam-greenfield/" title="Adam Greenfield says it's game over."&gt;
     Game over
    &lt;/a&gt;
    indeed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t see our civilization surviving this century even if no giant rock crosses our path. There are many reasons for this, but none original or interesting enough to dwell upon. At the same time I do think this is not the last century in which humans live.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we are all indeed descendants of a tribe that at some point numbered only 2000 individuals, as I’ve heard in a lecture once, then it doesn’t take much to imagine that out of billions enough people will survive to continue our species existence. Not even me imagines a world completely void of water, plants or small furry animals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Alas civilization needs more than mere presence of humans. Inspired by Irish post-Roman example a question occured to me recently:
    &lt;em&gt;
     “Which 100 books would you try to preserve if you wanted to preserve our civilization?”
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Point being that if things go the way of Dodo and people have to fight for survival, it wouldn’t be reasonable to expect enlightened person or small groups to preserve many more books than that. And books are still the best way to preserve knowledge in long term. Other forms are either too transient or can pack information far less densely.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I quickly realized two things. First, that I have no clue which books I would pick. And second, that there are more fundamental questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Can a civilization fluidly metamorphose from failing to a new, thriving and likely different civilization or does the new one need to start anew from ashes of previous ones?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Question matters, because I imagine that civilizations are in a way like companies. Establishing one is quite different than keeping one going and hence knowledge needed is probably different too. Most historical examples I know of persuaded me that scale of a problem and length of time before its full consequences are felt are inversely proportional to likelihood of our dealing with it before it is too late. However I am not a historian and could well be wrong. Still, you do with what you have and this seems reasonable enough assumption for further inspection.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Assuming this,
    &lt;em&gt;
     what does it take to establish a civilization?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One thing that comes to mind is a high enough density of people who don’t spend all of their time procuring food. This means they can’t be hunter gatherers and some agricultural knowledge needs to survive to successfully plant and grow existing crops or tame new ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would also be helpful if all technological knowledge isn’t lost either. Electrical gadgets will be hopelessly obsolete, but creating and fixing a good plow or knowing how to preserve perishable goods for longer periods of time will not be something to sneeze at. World might be full of decrepit remains that might be reused, but there is no good reason to leave it just to human ingenuity to discover how and to what purpose.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another way to increase number of people living is to stop them dying needlessly. Hence preservation of most effective ways to stay healthy and low tech remedies for most common diseases and injuries would be helpful too. Most drugs will be gone for centuries, but it’s remarkable how much can be achieved with what will hopefully still be found in nature.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mathematics is also an underpreciated, yet necessary underpinning of every developed civilization. Calculus will not be needed from the get-go, but just counting doesn’t get you far either. There’s hardly a plan that couldn’t be improved with a sensible application of mathematics. Related to this, basic economics should be preserved too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “There is no such thing as society,” said Margaret Thatcher, which of course is rubish and why it is not enough to learn how to live in complex social structures, but also why and in what ways. Therefore sociological and philosophical texts should also make cut. I find it difficult to imagine titles, because I don’t think culture is something you can implant. It is nurtured and developed not only by circumstances and challenges society faces, but also with choices it makes. It is unlikely that next round would follow our footsteps but optimist in me would love to leave something that inspires and gives something to aspire to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All these knowledge would be dead ink on paper if person holding a book doesn’t know how to read or what words actually mean. So alphabet learning book and a dictionary should also survive even though most of modern dictionary will probably be fairly useless by then and rest might be unhelpfully terse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last I would add a book about ecology trying to explain complexity of the world around us and why it would be wise to be careful how we try to change it. There is probably no better definition of stupidity then repeating same mistakes and expecting different results.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So
    &lt;em&gt;
     what did I end up with?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    An alphabet book, a dictionary and books about medicine, agriculture, mathematics, economy, sociology, philosophy, some basic technology and ecology. There are no titles since I don’t believe such books have been written yet. We have lived in a world full of books and knowledge for so long, that we simply never saw or had a reason to write a book premised on the idea, that it might be one of few books around.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In any case, even though I have spent more thoughts on this then is probably reasonable at this point, I am sure I haven’t thought of everything. What else have I missed?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I seem to have mentioned books I’ve been reading a lot in last few posts, but this is the first time I am writing a post solely dedicated to a book.
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0976470705"&gt;
     The Four Steps to the Epiphany
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0976470705" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1"/&gt;
    by Steven Gary Blank is a book I heard recommended a few times before
    &lt;a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/" title="Eric's blog"&gt;
     Eric Ries
    &lt;/a&gt;
    recommendation during his talk persuaded me, but I bought it mainly because it bothered me that most projects I was involved with relied heavily on intuition and it just seemed that there has to be a better way to expose and test assumptions made during project lifetime.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To a typography nut like me this book looks, well, horrible. I suspect Cafepress’ print-on-demand system has also something to do with it, but this is not its only fault. There are plenty of typos and glitches such as whole chapter 4 carrying a footer of chapter 3. Occasionally you can find grammar errors even someone like me can be sure of. In short, the book also looks like it wasn’t made by experienced publisher.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having said all that, if you are thinking of starting a business venture or really any project where you and people precisely like you are not the only target market, you should BUY AND READ THIS BOOK. It costs 40$ on Amazon, but I wouldn’t hesitate recommending it even if it cost ten times as much. For those who might doubt veracity of recommendation on account of my Amazon Affiliate link,
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705" title="Non-affiliated link to book"&gt;
     here is
    &lt;/a&gt;
    also a non-affiliated link that gains me nothing. Or you can save some more by following link on
    &lt;a href="http://steveblank.com/"&gt;
     Steve’s blog
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (which is a good read too).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Unlike most business books I read or browsed, it isn’t a 2-300 hundred page long discourse about a couple of ideas that could be adequately explained and argued in tenth of its length. It’s a textbook about Customer Development, a different way of organizing and building a company from startup to established company. This is done methodically, each step building on previous where every assumption is tested while it is still relatively cheap to do so. First 200 pages might occasionally contain a short story that proves a point, but are otherwise filled with very concrete advice on what needs to be done and how you can or should go about it. If that wasn’t enough, you also get a Custom Development Checklist (taking a quarter of the book) which you can use to check that nothing was left out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I suspect not many startups follow every step as prescribed, but even if you don’t or disagree with most of it, I can’t imagine how you wouldn’t profit from reading it. So just go and buy it. You won’t be able to make notes in borrowed copy.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Now that Mini Seedcamp in Ljubljana is behind me (an event that might warrant its own post), I finally have some time to write about
    &lt;a href="http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/FrontPage"&gt;
     Open Hack 2009
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m sorry to say to those who didn’t go that this might have been the biggest mistake you’ll do this year. It was indeed awesome. Before I go on I would also like to thank people at Yahoo for really pulling no stops in making it great and to everyone who came, for being inspiring, helpful and generally fun.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/"&gt;
     Fry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I made two hacks, a website
    &lt;a href="http://guesswhatthisis.appspot.com/"&gt;
     GuessWhatThisIs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    based on an idea we brought to event (but no code), and a game
    &lt;a href="http://friedcell.net/geopong/"&gt;
     GeoPong
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that Fry thought of in wee hours of Sunday. GeoPong, best described as “
    &lt;a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/05/11/open-hack-london-2009-my-presentation-and-quick-review/" title="Link to quote"&gt;
     a quite irrelevant but lovely hack
    &lt;/a&gt;
    “, doesn’t always work great (especially on non-FF browsers), nevertheless I am still amazed that we managed to build both, because we essentially did GuessWhatThisIs twice. Wifi didn’t work until later in the evening, so we built first version of the site with pieces of software we had on our machines an educated guess about APIs we needed but couldn’t access.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Event was thoroughly documented on Flickr, Twitter and plethora of other websites, so I won’t dwell much on that. Instead I’ll mention couple of observations that albeit not new, I still found interesting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First one is that team is absolutely everything. You can certainly do interesting stuff alone, but things really start happening if you have a good team. Working with talented and fun people mean ideas get fleshed out sooner, there’s little coordination and more things get done. If on top they are like Fry, who like a
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell_Bunny"&gt;
     Duracell Bunny
    &lt;/a&gt;
    just seems to keep going, you can finish projects you certainly would not otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hackday also provided another proof that all-nighters as development method are an idiotic idea. Most hackers, who certainly didn’t lack enthusiasm, fell asleep at some point during the night and those, like us, who didn’t, slowly fried our brains. Development slowed down to a glacial speed, code written was frankly embarassing and help was needed to resolve most basic problems. We spent more than 4 hours on GeoPong which normally shouldn’t take us more than half of one. Even worse from efficiency point of view was that Monday was gone too. All-nighter can be a fun thing to do once in a while, but it is really a crappy way to run a business.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end a small advice to organizers for next European event, on which I hope we won’t have to wait another two years. Try putting as much documentation and libraries on USB key as you can, so in case of wifi not working, we can still program with them instead of falling back to what we already intimately know or have on our machines.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I recently read
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Koster" rel="wikipedia" title="Raph Koster"&gt;
     Raph Koster

     Theory of Fun for Game Design
    &lt;/a&gt;

    , which I can heartily recommend to anyone interested in what games are all about. But it’s this part on page 88 that really got my attention, since I can relate it to what I do:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison, though:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games are good at
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification" rel="wikipedia" title="Objectification"&gt;
       objectification
      &lt;/a&gt;
      . Stories are good at empathy.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games are external — they are about people’s actions. Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal — they are about people’s emotions and thoughts.
     &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A lot has been said in last couple of years about
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic" rel="wikipedia" title="Game mechanic"&gt;
     game mechanics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or customization?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually means it wants to provoke action on visitor’s part. Intended action may be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or subscribe to blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction with a visitor.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull, but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage" title="Amazon"&gt;
     Amazon.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    presents other side of spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren’t there to read an item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items, reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn’t be used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you make a more informed decision on what and when to include.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I just read
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://crockford.com/" rel="homepage" title="Douglas Crockford"&gt;
     Douglas Crockford
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ‘s book
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596517742"&gt;
     JavaScript: The Good Parts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0596517742" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1"/&gt;
    . It’s what a technical book should be. Concise yet full of useful information as a result of clear scope and sticking to it. If my experience is anything to go by, then there are not many Javascript programmers who wouldn’t benefit from it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did found one bit that wasn’t quite right. On pages 91-92 Douglas discusses
    &lt;em&gt;
     string.split
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method, which can take a regular expression as a separator with which to split string. Douglas rightly points out that if regular expression includes capturing group (stuff between paranthesis like
    &lt;em&gt;
     b(mmm)c
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ), then strings matching those groups will be included in the split.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However Douglas is not completely correct when he says that some implementations drop empty strings in the output array when separator is regular expression. If you run
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jssplit/index.html"&gt;
     this demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.firefox.com/" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla Firefox 3"&gt;
     Firefox3
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and IE7, you’ll see that IE7 drops even non-empty strings from capturing groups, while Firefox3 includes them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I would find a bug in my code faster this week if I read his book sooner.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My wife and I have a problem. We love buying and reading books, but ran out of shelf space for them years ago. So we’ve been storing some of them in closets and boxes while we find a more suitable solution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://pdml.net/pipermail/pdml_pdml.net/2009-February/161396.html"&gt;
     Like others
    &lt;/a&gt;
    we love physicality of books and it is hard to imagine buying artifacts that exist only in digital form. However, while searching for a good solution I did notice that useful life-span of most technical books is only few years and that we would save a lot of space and trees if I bought and read their electronic versions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This has lead to my renewed interest in state of electronic readers, which I’ve been following on and off since I first heard of technology almost a decade ago. In last few months I got a chance to try first version of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="homepage" title="Amazon Kindle"&gt;
     Kindle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , read few chapters on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader" rel="wikipedia" title="Sony Reader"&gt;
     Sony Reader
    &lt;/a&gt;
    PRS-505, checked how it feels to do it on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch"&gt;
     iPod touch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and read
    &lt;a href="http://designingwebinterfaces.com/" title="Book's homepage"&gt;
     Designing Web Interfaces
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to the end on Nokia N770. By the way, I can only recommend that book to anyone interested in development of web applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So this post will be short overview of my experience so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Dedicated electronic readers
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As said, I’ve used Kindle1 and Sony PRS-505, although my experience so far has been mostly colored by later. Most if not all such currently available devices are based on same technology,
    &lt;a href="http://www.eink.com/"&gt;
     E-ink
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , and hence offer fairly similar reading experience as far as visuals go.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That experience is very good. It’s not quite paper, but it is certainly much nicer to read than computer screens, especially outside. It’s most annoying current limitation is probably absence of colors and depiction of b&amp;amp;w images in 16 or less shades of gray. You won’t be buying photo books for them any time soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What bothered me more though were tendency to use proprietary formats (Kindle) and absence of search (almost everyone else). I expected that device designers would notice that electronic format doesn’t offer a chance to flip through pages and remember position of interesting passages spatially and would counter this by adding a search function, yet most didn’t and as such these devices really are readers and not researchers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With good technical books I spend more time looking up pieces of information than I spent reading it in the first place. I guess I would be willing to sacrifice search if devices themselves were significantly cheaper, but since they aren’t, I won’t be buying one anytime soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, if you like reading lots of books but don’t care about owning them, you should really look into them. They are simply magnificient when it comes to packing A LOT of books into tiniest amount of space without sacrificing much readability. Hell, since most if not all readers allow you to set text size, it might even be easier to read on them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Tablets
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I own and use two, iPod touch and ancient
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia 770 Internet Tablet"&gt;
     Nokia N770
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s a common story with multipurpose devices. You get to do a lot with them, but you usually have to sacrifice something compared to specialised gadgets.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I haven’t read much on iPod touch and it’s unlikely I ever will. It has a fairly small screen (and screen resolution) that makes it rather unpleasant to read texts with plenty of tables and diagrams. Pinching screen looks nice on commercials and doesn’t bother me too much when browsing web, but it gets tiresome quickly enough that I don’t want to do it repeatedly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also tried Kindle application, which works well enough for literature, but is even more limiting than Kindle device. There is no search and you don’t flip through pages all the time only if you are comfortable with reading text at smallest font size.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nokia on the other hand has screen good and big enough that I needed to scroll only in one direction. Since that can be done with the same button that is used to flip through pages, I could read book using only one hand, which is nice since it let me read in most impossible body positions. As iPod touch it also has a color screen that is quite useful when dealing with technical material. What it lacks though is search in its PDF viewer that is also missing even in latest maemo incarnation on OS2008 (checked on Fry’s tablet).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Too bad. Nevertheless it will remain my main
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book" rel="wikipedia" title="E-book"&gt;
     ebook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    reading device for foreseeable future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Other observations
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As already noted, I feel current crop of readers are geared mainly to reading books and not much to browsing or searching. Since most of them are built on same technological base, it’s understandable that their hardware is very similar, but I was still surprised to see that same lack of distinction when it comes to features implemented in software.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I thought about buying printed and electronic copy, but changed my mind when I looked at
    &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516253/index.html"&gt;
     price of the bundle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . What I thought I would be buying is convenience. What price suggests to me is a sale of another copy. I probably would buy both, if price of bundle would be up to 15% higher than price of printed version.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That does not mean publishers are wrong, since I am hardly a representative sample, but I suspect I am not the only one who is thinking about building electronic library before they go ahead and purchase a reader. This transitioning phase where readers are not widespread yet might not be long enough to matter anyway and publishers probably don’t care about speeding it along since for most of them devices are just a content transportation mechanism that isn’t owned by them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tablets, with screen and resolution big enough work surprisingly well as long as you don’t try to read under direct sun light. Their other downsides are much shorter battery life and need for good eye-sight unless you are willing to scroll a lot.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, even though I won’t be buying an electronic reader this year, it is only a matter of time when one of them will replace my tablets as reading device.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a month since I got an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch"&gt;
     iPod touch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as a present and I’ve been using it regularly since. I still have and use both a
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia"&gt;
     Nokia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    N65 phone and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet"&gt;
     Nokia N770 tablet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but use of later has been diminished in last month.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     iPod touch experience
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t help not to think of Touch as basically this decade’s Palm organizer. Thin widget with pleasant user experience that can be extended with myriad of applications, whose developers are — judging by iPhone versions — limited not by their imagination, but with device capabilities and limited expandability.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still don’t like its on-screen keyboard and wish I had at least something like
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)"&gt;
     Graffiti
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Hence I don’t write on it anything longer than two sentences and together with lack of camera, built-in microphone, GPS, Bluetooth or even just self-made software, it makes Touch a read-mainly device. Consumer device would be another, more ghastly, but appropriate description.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a side note, even my now aged N770 tablet is more friendly to creators and hence I still find use for it. I just don’t want to browse web on it because of its very very dated browser that can’t be updated.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, even with annoying limitations I like iPod touch a lot. It’s hard not to with its polished interface and an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" rel="homepage" title="App Store"&gt;
     App Store
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that is probably its killer application. Choice of applications in Slovenia is more limited than in USA, but still very wide and downloading them is so easy and cheap, you might have to fight against developing an addiction to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     So what about Nokia?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mobile devices space has become really interesting in last year. iPhone, iPod touch, Android with G1 and upcoming Palm Pre are finally bringing experience on web and otherwise, that we were promised years ago. But what this list lacks is any gadgets from Nokia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like Nokia. They had friendliest phones that are remarkably open in industry that likes to control everything. I think their tablets are great, even with shortcomings that should be resolved by now. But even with lots of innovation I get an impression that they are lagging behind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a complete outsider who only passingly follows what is happening in mobile industry, I can only ignorantly speculate about its reasons and plans.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe first problem for Nokia is that unlike
    &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com/"&gt;
     Palm
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com" rel="homepage" title="Apple"&gt;
     Apple
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or even
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://google.com" rel="homepage" title="Google"&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    it’s not a niche player and tries to build phone for every possible user. It releases them too often. Taken together it is no wonder that just Nokia Europe
    &lt;a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products"&gt;
     lists
    &lt;/a&gt;
    115 devices that are either selling now, were recently or will be in near future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s too many devices, each with slightly different software, that create a very fragmented market. In such environment you can’t really hope that application would be pushing phones capabilities which aren’t there in most cases. Hence applications Nokia offers are not nearly as exciting as what Apple has.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Next problem presents development environment, which is simply awful.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.symbian.com" rel="homepage" title="Symbian"&gt;
     Symbian
    &lt;/a&gt;
    might have been a nice platform back when, but its time has passed and I doubt open-sourcing it will help. Java hardly works better, but it’s probably a bit nicer to use even though it feels slower. Python is nice for tinkering, but not really an option until it becomes pre-installed. There’s also a web runtime, which is mostly missing. Few phones support it and only one phone available can use it for something more significant than a window to web.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Much of what I just said is not true for tablets, but historically they didn’t seem to get much love from company. Too bad, since I think they are one of the most exiciting things Nokia has.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do remain an optimist. Purchase and relicensing of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/" rel="homepage" title="Qt (toolkit)"&gt;
     Qt
    &lt;/a&gt;
    together with its upcoming S60 version signals that company is aware of development problems. Qt also offers a possibility of a framework that could be used everywhere and hopefully this will include Fremantle. Generally I don’t put too much faith in rumors, but some of them give credible hints that next tablet could be even better than an already great N810. If it also brings a distribution model comparable to App Store and a bit more polish, then it could be a big success even with non-geeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But what they need to do in my opinion is spend less time trying to build all encompassing services like
    &lt;a href="http://www.ovi.com/"&gt;
     Ovi
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and spend more effort in building amazing devices that integrate well with what is already out there. And by integration I don’t mean an app hidden in some folder on phone. Upload to
    &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/"&gt;
     Flickr
    &lt;/a&gt;
    should be available right after you took a photo. I also wish they didn’t try to leverage existing platform and users so much and were more daring and forward looking. If platform you have is stopping you from developing a phone you want, then find or develop a better one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Until then I am sticking with what I got. A great phone for my needs that few match and a couple of nice tablets.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I often find myself in a room with web developers and at least one of them proclaiming that IE6 sucks because it doesn’t support web standards while others nod in agreement.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This has bothered me enough to contemplate having a talk at
    &lt;a href="http://www.barcamp.si/"&gt;
     BarCamp Ljubljana
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I didn’t, but this is what I would say.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Explorer 6"&gt;
     Internet Explorer 6
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was released on 27th August 2001, when twin towers were still standing in NY.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    7 years is a long time to remember, but what did we work with back then? There was no
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" rel="homepage" title="Safari (web browser)"&gt;
     Safari
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and Firefox was still in its infacy, far from 1.0 release coming 3 years later. It was changing so often most developers simply ignored it. Opera was at version 5 (version 6 came out in November of that year) and I am sure I am not alone in remembering how awful it was at least until version 7 in 2003.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://mozilla.com" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla"&gt;
     Mozilla
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was at version 0.6 and although showing great promise, IE6 definitely was the browser we hoped others would match.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Back then no browser supported CSS2 in a meaningful capacity. Opera had the best support for CSS until then, but IE6 surpassed it. It didn’t support DOM Level 2, which was standardized only 4 months before first beta of IE6. Good excuse not available anymore to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Explorer 7"&gt;
     IE7
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and IE8. Apart from that it supported more or less everything web developer could want back then and then some. IE6 problem isn’t so much that it didn’t support standards of its time as it is that it doesn’t support standards of today.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why the hostility?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta" rel="wikipedia" title="Lancia Delta"&gt;
     Lancia Delta Integrale
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don’t hear them go around complaining how it doesn’t meet standards of todays cars.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, as I’ve said, 7 years is a long time and most web developers are not old gits like me, so the historic context isn’t there. We also have to live with its real shortcomings today. But I think there’s more to this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Complaining about IE6 standards deficiencies is declaring who you are and where you stand. It’s a simple and very recognizable way of declaring you are a member of web-standards tribe. IE6 bitching has at least as much to do with proclaimer as with proclamation’s subject. Trashing IE6 isn’t so much talking about the browser as it is talking about you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However it is not unreasonable to ask why IE6 doesn’t better support standards that were released or updated after its initial release.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Certainly more could be done through software updates, but are standards themselves forward looking in a way that would avoid updating browser internals with every new version of a particular standard?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am quite certain that this isn’t always possible. I don’t see how you could add a video object from
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5" rel="wikipedia" title="HTML 5"&gt;
     HTML5
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to a browser without explicit support from browser’s developers. But not all changes are such as
    &lt;a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5"&gt;
     John Allsopp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has recently pointed out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have mixed feelings about HTML5. It’s bringing much needed new capabilities and lots of goodies, but I also think
    &lt;a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/15/Grandiosity"&gt;
     Sam Ruby
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has a point. New, simple,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration" rel="wikipedia" title="Document Type Declaration"&gt;
     DOCTYPE
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is reduced to a switch between standards and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode" rel="wikipedia" title="Quirks mode"&gt;
     quirks mode
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and unless it will become more complicated in later revisions, it won’t offer an easy way to distinguish between HTML5 documents and other HTML versions. This isn’t a particular problem if newer revisions will be backwards compatible with older, but this isn’t true even of HTML5. Why would we think this is the last version where we will make a major misstep that needs backwards-incompatible correction?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are other things I don’t like about HTML5, but if I would have to pick one thing I would like to see changed, is to make it more extendable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To sum it up, IE6 is indeed a problem in todays development, but it’s also at least at fault for this. It was an excellent browser when it came out and is remarkably solid one for software so old. There are many reasons, completely untouched in this post, why its users don’t migrate to something newer, but we, web developers, are also to blame, because we tend to standardize only current practice and leave few doors open for future development which invariably comes.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As I am leaving on a short vacation that will probably take me off grid for few days, there is still a time for a hopefully short, but definitely last post of this year. I don’t like how registration forms ask me twice for password and I think I can offer a better way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most registration forms these days still want you to type password of your choice twice. They probably do it to reduce risk of mistyping it. I deeply dislike Facebook, but I think this is one thing it
    &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Registration form on Facebook's homepage"&gt;
     got right
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . You only have to do it once. Those with FB accounts can see this in action if they log out for a moment and visit front page.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are several reasons why once is enough. First one is that every decent page provides a way to reset password in case you have forgotten it. So even if password was mistyped, it’s easy to reset it again to a different value. Second reason is that by now it’s quite well known that most people use a low single-digit number of passwords and don’t come up with a new one each time they are asked to do so. Hence it’s quite unlikely they’ll make an error now after so much practice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Third reason is that in most cases you can
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" title="Demonstration of show password switch"&gt;
     help them
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" style="font-size: 29.25px; line-height: 42.75px;" title="Demonstration of show password switch"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When registration forms first appeared internet access was rare and expensive enough that most common environment in which it was used was work or school. It was therefore likely that when you were registering for a service, you weren’t alone and entered password had to be hidden from people around you. Today it’s probably opposite. Most of the time I am quite private and could see what I type with no additional security risk.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So as in demo we could offer a switch that let visitors see what they are typing if they choose to do so. It should still be hidden by default, since we can’t really tell the environment visitor is in or if Javascript is available. It is always better to err on side of safety.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a side note for those who might have peaked at implementation. I’m replacing password input field because of Internet Explorer, which doesn’t tolerate type attribute change on input fields. Every other browser tested (FF, Opera, Safari and Chrome) would work perfectly fine by just switching field type from password to text.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Anyhow, that’s it for this year. If you leave a comment, which I hope you will, and I don’t answer, it’s because I lack Internet access.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s an HTML pattern that has been bugging me for a while even though I’m guilty of using it too. It’s even present on page you are reading right now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Almost every page has a navigation bar and chances are that strip is presented as some kind of a list of links. Just as it should be. What bothers me is that when you actually are on page listed in navigation, its navigation item will
    &lt;a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/" title="An example of this pattern"&gt;
     still contain
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a link to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This reference to itself is like having a door in a room which leads you back in. Not very useful and certainly misleading.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Better approach is to simply not have a link when that link would point to page itself. Such HTML is also more semantic, since it’s clear which item was selected and where we are even without a style sheet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When discussing this observation it was pointed out to me that with proliferation of Javascript and AJAX you might want to give your visitors a way to bring a page to a known state by reloading it. I think this is more than adequately solved by reload button that every browser has and most users know, but if you find having a link a better solution, why not try a compromise. Just add the missing link with Javascript in spirit of
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/link.html"&gt;
     this demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This way you won’t polute content markup with behavior that should sit on top of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    December is running out of days fast and I still haven’t written my annual review of things I planned or did, intentionally or otherwise. I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but couldn’t find words to express myself. Finally I gave up. I don’t think I’ll succeed now, but I doubt more time would help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For me this year has been absolutely wonderful. Coming to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    meant I could work on interesting problems to improve a tool I use myself while collaborating with people I like and respect. I traveled to more conferences than ever before and generally learned a lot. I’m proud of my team’s achievements and of what we did as a company. It is indeed a privilege to have a gig like this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve also started a private project with a friend, which is coming along nicely. It shouldn’t be too long before we can show it to, well, everyone interested. Hopefully that means to many.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In all, 2008 was great for me and I don’t think 2009 will be worse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet of late I’ve been feeling increasingly gloomy. This has remarkably little to do with economic crisis, influence of which we can already feel even if it’s yet to hit with full force. I won’t be traveling as much next year, but I planned to do less of it even before I knew there might be economic reasons to do so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been worrying about the state of our planet for years. Things weren’t getting better as quickly as I thought they should. In fact, they aren’t getting better at all, but I hoped we would turn and do what needs to be done when given last chance.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are many things that are deeply wrong in this world. Slavery
    &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/slavery-worse-than-ever"&gt;
     is more widespread
    &lt;/a&gt;
    than probably ever. We know we should reduce the amount of CO
    &lt;sub&gt;
     2
    &lt;/sub&gt;
    in atmosphere, yet
    &lt;a href="http://www.mnp.nl/en/publications/2008/GlobalCO2emissionsthrough2007.html"&gt;
     we do opposite
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Fisheries around world are rapidly
    &lt;a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0918-hance_fish.html"&gt;
     collapsing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    taking whole ecosystems with them. Glaciers
    &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/10/poznan-brazil-climate-change-environment"&gt;
     are receding
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with probably disastrous effect on water supplies for millions of people. Rising world population will continue to negate any progress we may have. I
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7780040.stm"&gt;
     could go on
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but this list is depressing enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After all it’s not the scale or number of challenges that
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7786910.stm"&gt;
     is dispiriting
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s our
    &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/12/greenpolitics-poznan"&gt;
     inability to act
    &lt;/a&gt;
    decisively. We prefer compromises that set targets too low and then
    &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2008/12/when_targets_miss_the_point.html"&gt;
     fail to meet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    them. There are 6.5 billion of us, but we are still unable to face real probability that this may be too many. I sometimes wonder how lives looked like in last days of civilizations long gone, most of them disappearing precisely because they taxed their environment too much. I hope I’m wrong and never find out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wished to end this post on a positive note, but I’m clearly failing. I do sincerely wish everyone happy holidays and the best of luck in next year. I’m afraid we’ll need it.

    I use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://gmail.com" rel="homepage" title="Gmail"&gt;
     Gmail
    &lt;/a&gt;
    mainly for reading mailing lists. I’m old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control it, but otherwise I can’t fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can’t). Go to the Lab tab in settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type is:unread in search box and confirm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists unread messages. It’s not perfect though. It won’t show you how many messages are unread and you can’t subscribe to it through
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Message Access Protocol"&gt;
     IMAP
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other thing that is not perfect is
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://docs.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google Docs"&gt;
     Google Docs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which I quite like. I did encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I imagine it might be in not too distant future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    How do you move documents between accounts?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it seems I can’t transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is not only not obvious, but also doesn’t work all the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would love to hear them.

    I was

     reading
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham" rel="wikipedia" title="Paul Graham"&gt;
     Paul Graham
    &lt;/a&gt;
    today, who among other things touched on a subject that has been on my mind lately. Software shipping.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At Zemanta, we usually don’t ship daily although when needed we do. We try to do a release of new features and bug fixes every 2-3 weeks and on the whole we are succeeding. Still, this is not as often as many startups profess to do and it’s certainly not as often as most of us would like. Even though I probably bear the majority of “blame” for this, I too wish we shipped more often.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why don’t we?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are many factors that define how quickly can something be shipped and even though I don’t think I have an exhaustive list, I find following most important (listed in no particular order):
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     code base
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     shipping changes
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     team
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     tolerance of failure
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     time
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Code base
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Simply put,
    &lt;strong&gt;
     better code is easier to change
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    and evolve with new features without introducing new bugs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Speed of development rarely results in pristine code, so we need to clean things up every now and then, which creates a need to regularly evaluate the quality of our code base and its impact on our ability to deliver.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Shipping changes
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Smaller changes are easier to check
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    and quicker to develop. More intrusive new code is, harder it is to reliably avoid detrimental effect on already existing code.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Fixing, testing and shipping a CSS bug can be done almost instantly. Changing core of the widget usually takes a bit more effort to avoid regressions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Team
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Better developers produce better code
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    more quickly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Some testing is always necessary, but there’s a direct connection between code author’s reputation and experience and trust we put in his code.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Tolerance of failure
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tolerance of users and tolerance of system to change is crucial.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you provide a service where failure is not an option, then this should affect at least how deeply tested new release has to be. It’s also important for your system to be able to revert to last working state, but sometimes this is not desired and important glitches need to be fixed as they are encountered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Time
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If your
    &lt;strong&gt;
     schedule
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    is
    &lt;strong&gt;
     too tight to fix bugs
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    found in new release, it’s
    &lt;strong&gt;
     too tight for release
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No matter how much you test your software and at Zemanta we do this a lot, new code will introduce new bugs. It will happen that some of them will be too big to wait for next scheduled release and need an immediate fix. If you for some reason can’t afford this, then it may be better not to ship yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    Pendulum of change
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It should be obvious from this list that no factor is set in stone and what might have been a right decision few months ago might not be best one now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A lot has changed in last few months, so the next time we address this topic, I suspect my opinion will be different than last time.

    I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked
    &lt;a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/" title="John's homepage"&gt;
     John Lily
    &lt;/a&gt;
    why haven’t they integrated
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.greasespot.net/" rel="homepage" title="Greasemonkey"&gt;
     Greasemonkey
    &lt;/a&gt;
    into
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="homepage" title="Firefox"&gt;
     Firefox
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Wrong question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know was:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     “Why doesn’t
     &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://mozilla.com" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla"&gt;
      Mozilla
     &lt;/a&gt;
     integrate Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?”
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It’s them who decide how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone’s computer and belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)  to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     “To whom does a browser belong to?”
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation doesn’t need to be. I find
    &lt;a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/"&gt;
     Platypus extension
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a good first step to how a browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even further to their needs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I’m failing to find anything substantial.

    I’m back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn’t publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are places where I’ve been, places where I wouldn’t like to go again and places like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="wikipedia" title="Namibia"&gt;
     Namibia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , where you ask yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country and its fantastic people, so I won’t even try where so many have failed before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn’t miss it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia. Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3 letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be good.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In other news I will be giving a talk at Web 2.0 Expo in
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" rel="wikipedia" title="Berlin"&gt;
     Berlin

   &lt;p&gt;
    Jonathan
    &lt;a href="http://spyced.blogspot.com/2008/08/app-engine-conclusions.html#"&gt;
     wrote
    &lt;/a&gt;
    his thoughts about
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://appengine.google.com" rel="homepage" title="Google App Engine"&gt;
     App Engine
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . They are well worth a read if you are thinking about using it, but haven’t so far. I used App Engine sporadically for a couple of months on a project of mine, but I finally gave up and ended porting my code to pure
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.djangoproject.com" rel="homepage" title="Django (web framework)"&gt;
     Django
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which admittedly wasn’t too hard to do at this point in time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Some of my reasons match Jonathan’s. There were too many rough edges to feel really productive and too much time was wasted on trying to find out if problem lies in poor documentation, incomplete implementation or stupid programmer. I probably will never get answers to questions like how can a simple Django view that doesn’t do anything beside rendering a static template, consume above expected amount of CPU and risk triggering quota blockage, but right now I really don’t care anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Integrating
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google" rel="crunchbase" title="Google"&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    accounts is indeed easy, but it is also very shallow to the point of being practically useless.  You basically can only rely on fact that reference to a particular user won’t change. Anything else you may think you know (like an email address), can’t be relied upon. You can’t create an account and you can’t even control login form of your service. In essence you don’t have your own users, you can just offer a service to Google’s.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For me this was one of two major reasons for my decision. Every person who would need an account to use what I am building would need to agree to Google’s
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service" rel="wikipedia" title="Terms of service"&gt;
     TOS
    &lt;/a&gt;
    agreement which defines many things, among others the highest level of privacy I can offer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other reason was that current limitations of App Engine really lead you to rely heavily on provided APIs, which may be similar to stuff out there (like Django), but aren’t anywhere close to being a drop-in replacement. This can be — depending on application you’re writing — a heavy investement in a platform you don’t control a bit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Put more profanely, you are a Google’s bitch.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having said all this, I do think App Engine is a very valuable service. If you want to write a mini-app, a web tool like
    &lt;a href="http://simonwillison.net/" title="Simon's homepage"&gt;
     Simon
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jul/29/jsonhead/" title="Post about json-head service"&gt;
     does
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , then App Engine is brilliant. You can do this easily with little deployment and zero administration hassle. In fact I can’t think of any other service better suited to this task.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m sure this is not the only scenario in which App Engine makes sense and there are others I haven’t named or thought of. Issues, like accounts, can with some effort be solved now. But App Engine also isn’t (yet) what some of us were hoping for and it’s prudent to really think through what you want, what you need and what App Engine actually offers.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a while since I used
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="homepage" title="Python (programming language)"&gt;
     Python
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for anything larger than scripts few tens lines long, so it feels really great to do it again. I did discover however that I became a bit rusty. Not so much in not being able to achieve what I want as not being sure that I do it in a sensible and pythonic way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been working on a private project where I came to a following problem.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" rel="wikipedia" title="Application programming interface"&gt;
     API
    &lt;/a&gt;
    calls can trigger various responses, somewhat like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol"&gt;
     HTTP
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , containing status codes together with a short description. Every faulty response should trigger its own exception, which led me to my first implementation:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
class Unauthorized(Exception):
    status = 101
    value = "Unauthorized."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I didn’t like it even though it looks and behaves like it should. What I wanted was a better overlook of possible responses in a way where I have to make any possible changes easily and only at one place.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/pyexceptions/exceptions1.txt" title="Example"&gt;
     second attempt
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was auto-generating exception classes using type. Since class definition took only a line instead of three, it certainly achieved better transparency, but I still had to make changes at two places.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/pyexceptions/exceptions2.txt"&gt;
     Final step
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was to auto-generate classes in a loop. To do this I attached them to module namespace using globals() dictionary. Actually I used &lt;strong&gt;builtin&lt;/strong&gt; one at first, but it obviously didn’t work that great.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So this is what I have now. It works and achieves my goals. I only need to change dictionary to add a new response or change existing one and it could hardly be more readable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But is it pythonic enough? If not, what would be, apart from traditional way described in first step?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    EuroPython 2008 is over. I packed and now I am waiting to leave for the airport to catch afternoon flight back home. Sadly I don’t have time to attend sprints and since I only recently started to write python again, I probably wouldn’t be of much use anyhow.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Conference itself was great. Smaller than web conferences I usually attend with a more friendly, homey feeling, but with plenty of excellent talks where I learned a lot. I also met a bunch of friendly interesting people and had in general a wonderful time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It was also interesting to compare the whole experience with other conferences I go to. Apple is popular, but there are fewer
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh" rel="wikipedia" title="Macintosh"&gt;
     Macs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    than at web events.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="homepage" title="Ubuntu (operating system)"&gt;
     Ubuntu
    &lt;/a&gt;
    seems to completely dominate
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="wikipedia" title="Linux"&gt;
     Linux
    &lt;/a&gt;
    crowd (me included), since it was the only distribution I actually have seen and Windows is in minority. Everyone is much more willing to participate to the point, where sadly not all who wanted to present a Lightning talk on last day had the opportunity to do so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I certainly hope to attend EuroPython 2009, which will be in Birmingham around this time next year. At the end I also have a present. Yesterday I got a license for
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wingware.com" rel="homepage" title="Wing IDE"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Today I switched to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.firefox.com/" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla Firefox"&gt;
     Firefox 3
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as my main browser. I didn’t want to, because as a policy I try to use most common version as default, but I made a mistake of opening version 3 and since then none of my old add-ons seem to work on previous version anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If I was still a young pup, I would probably dive into config files, search
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" rel="wikipedia" title="World Wide Web"&gt;
     the web
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for answers and try to fix it. But when you get to 34, time becomes too precious to muck about needlessly and you just want to focus on things you need or better yet want to do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So version three it is. This has got me thinking about something else. It’s remarkable how difficult or simply an annoyance it still is to have two version of a browser installed. Clearly this should be possible and is in interest of everyone involved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Anyway, enough of ranting. Time to get back to cutting cake…

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It has been a busy week. We had a new release at
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com/" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta ltd."&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , first big one that I was a part of. While things didn’t go as smoothly as we would hope, I think it has been a big success. I would like to thank all involved for their huge contribution and especially to my team, which never stops astonishing me. It’s a pleasure and a privilege to work with you all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We also made a small blunder with cursor moving while typing your post. Emptying your browser cache should remedy this. Please let me know if it doesn’t. Even though we are still in alpha, we don’t see this as an excuse for poor performance.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It has been a release full of features, but two of them are especially dear to me even though I haven’t contributed much to either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     clean HTML
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We heard numerous, quite correct complaints that HTML we insert in posts is not valid or nice enough. We did this partly because of honest mistakes on our part (e.g. putting IDs on elements that can appear more than once per page) or because it is really difficult to insert an HTML fragment that will look OK everywhere, no matter the blogging platform or visual template used.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end we came to conclusion that it is not feasible for us to do this, so we now offer you a choice. If you do nothing, you will still get the same styled HTML for related articles. But if you chose a clean xHTML option in preferences, which can be find below articles list, you will get a clean, unstyled xHTML which you can style to your liking. We still haven’t settled on final HTML for it, so any
    &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/zemanta" title="Zemanta support forum"&gt;
     feedback
    &lt;/a&gt;
    would be more than welcome.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Reblog
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other feature I am really fond of is
    &lt;a href="http://www.zemanta.com/reblog/" title="Reblog's homepage"&gt;
     reblog
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Using Zemanta added a little orange image at the end of the post. It was basically a small ad for us, which we really appreciated. This ad has been replaced with new image that offers your visitors an easy way to continue discussion on their blogs by choosing a paragraph from your story to quote and adding their thoughts before publishing it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can see an example on this very post. Just press reblog button at the end. We are continuously discovering and fixing quirks in parsing HTML text out there, but if you find a new one, please let us know.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So these were my favorite features. What were yours?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    for a long time until it became obvious to me that lots of interesting stuff moved there and can’t be easily found elsewhere. So I made

    I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that has stopped working, please let me know.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn rich-text editing on. It’s hard to imagine that it simply doesn’t exist.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was recently discussing how I think all code, especially mine, is crap and since this position has been and likely still is controversial, it might not be a bad idea to discuss it a bit more. This likely won’t avoid grievances and disputes, but it might save me some work in explaining myself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve never written a non-trivial amount of code that I wouldn’t find at least a bit embarrassing two years later. Partly because of my own deficiencies as a programmer, partly because our craft evolves and does so rather speedily. Even if I was as good a programmer as I would like to be, our profession would still develop and my code would eventually become crap. It would just take a bit longer than it does now. In a way, with maybe few exceptions, all code
    &lt;em&gt;
     left alone
    &lt;/em&gt;
    is on natural trajectory to a state of crappiness.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally I don’t find this insulting. If anything I would be terrified to discover that my old code doesn’t bug me at all. I would see it as a signal that I haven’t developed my craft much in this time.
    &lt;strong&gt;
     You haven’t peaked until you stagnated
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are also other benefits to this position. Since I find my code at least a bit dubious, I’m not enamored with it to the point, where I would find it difficult to ditch it if need be. It helps me being more detached and rational about its merits or lack thereof.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In contrast with what I just said, it also helps me from scraping it too soon. Accepting that some level of crappiness is a given, I don’t feel as much need in reformatting, refactoring or rewriting code that offends my sensibilities. I like reading pretty or even inspirational code as much as the next programmer, but esthetics are not too important. As long as code is functional, bug-scarce, maintainable and generally usable enough, it’s also pretty enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So if you happen to hear me insensitively remarking that some code is crap, please try to keep in mind that my completely universal belief means it’s not meant to be personal or even negative. I likely regard your code and skill higher than mine. I am truly sorry, if you nevertheless feel bad about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Debugging Javascript applications</title><link href="/debugging-javascript-applications.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-14T16:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:,2008-04-14:debugging-javascript-applications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Debugging web applications used to be simple. You generated a page and sent it to client. Visitors performed actions and you got back their response. Since filling a form was practically the most complicated action they could perform, it was relatively easy to find bugs if you were smart enough to include debugging support on server. You just had to trace user’s steps to find the one where things went amiss.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Javascript heavy applications changed that. Now a lot of action is happening far from your eyes and even when application does communicate with a server, it might just be a request to store or fetch more data without any hints about what’s happening over there. That’s fine and we are all happy as long as everything works. Too bad that sooner or later it usually doesn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why I decided to write a simple debugging support I can plug in my older projects that I still need to support and use in any upcoming ones that could benefit from it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Goals
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I want my script to have the following characteristics:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     be short and simple enough so I can rely on it not to be a cause of new problems
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     it can be triggered through Javascript or by manipulating URL
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     adaptable to different scenarios
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     it avoids unnecessary replication by supporting Firebug’s logging calls
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Point two in the list means I should have a choice between automatic start of debugging by changing URL a bit or through Javascript at the time of my liking. This way I’m free to choose the best way and moment to debug my application.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By adaptable I mean I have free hands when it comes to how much gets logged, how far back do I keep logs and how does that information get sent to me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Supporting Firebug means that its logging calls are used. So same debugging calls that might have been used during development can also be used for debugging problems in deployed site and don’t bother script execution in non-debug mode.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Implementation
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/debug.js" title="Javascript debugging module"&gt;
     result
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , packed in around 100 lines of code. It should be included at the top of your Javascript code or as quickly as you’d like to use it. I think it’s pretty self-explanatory, but you can also look at demonstration page described a bit later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Debugging is stored in an object
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and gets started by either including
    &lt;em&gt;
     dbg=true
    &lt;/em&gt;
    parameter in URL or calling
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.debugStart
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method. In later case you can provide the method with a function as first parameter that gets called on Javascript error or when we stop debugging with a call of
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.debugEnd
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We can provide the same function by assigning it to
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.debugDisplay
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . It gets called the same way with one parameter of an array of debugging messages. It’s completely up to it to decide what to do with that information and what value to return, but return values have the same meaning as they have in
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.onerror
    &lt;/em&gt;
    handler. If processing Javascript error,
    &lt;em&gt;
     true
    &lt;/em&gt;
    means that error was processed and script can continue and
    &lt;em&gt;
     false
    &lt;/em&gt;
    will lead to error message dialog box.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.debugStart
    &lt;/em&gt;
    can also receive a parameter object with attributes
    &lt;em&gt;
     level
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     count
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     callback
    &lt;/em&gt;
    for debugging level, number of saved messages and
    &lt;em&gt;
     debugDisplay
    &lt;/em&gt;
    function respectively. Level and message count can also be set through URL by providing parameters
    &lt;em&gt;
     dbglevel
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     dbgcount
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Demo
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can see final result called in two ways. Using
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/debug.html?dbg=true&amp;amp;dbglevel=3&amp;amp;dbgcount=10" title="URL based debugging"&gt;
     modified URL
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , where debugging parameters are set through URL, and
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/debug.html" title="non-URL based debugging"&gt;
     the one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , where debugging isn’t turned on by default. It’s same page in both cases and so is mostly its behavior.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In first case we start fetching debugging messages immediately and display them with a press on
    &lt;strong&gt;
     End debugging
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    . We can’t restart debugging in this scenario, but we can in second case.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In second case we start and continue debugging with a press on
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Start debugging
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    button, that got displayed in the first place because
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.on
    &lt;/em&gt;
    was set to
    &lt;em&gt;
     false
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.on
    &lt;/em&gt;
    is a
    &lt;em&gt;
     Boolean
    &lt;/em&gt;
    that shows if debugging is currently turned on or off.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In both cases only messages of requested levels get saved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Discussion
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even though I tried to leave things as open to extending as possible, I mainly tried to cover use cases I already encountered. Therefore this script, as it is, doesn’t support graceful handling of browser crashes, which it could, if it saved debug information to local storage when available.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Script also doesn’t support loading different libraries in debug mode. That is, if you want to load libraries stripped of debugging calls when not debugging, you can do that yourself, using
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.console.on
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . This script won’t do it for you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do provide a skeleton
    &lt;em&gt;
     debugDisplay
    &lt;/em&gt;
    in case you don’t provide one yourself. If you don’t, then debug message gets displayed using
    &lt;em&gt;
     alert
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , which makes it hard to copy and paste, but easy enough to make a screenshot of. Setting debugging level is probably not as nice as it could be too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not completely stupid though, takes note of
    &lt;em&gt;
     Array
    &lt;/em&gt;
    object’s suitability mainly for sparse and small arrays and should perform adequately when it comes to memory consumption even with new IE8 as long as count parameter isn’t too big.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end, it’s a piece of code as any I’ve written. Bugs are likely, so bug reports would be appreciated. Same goes for ideas and suggestions. If you need it, feel free to use it any way you want, but I would appreciate a ping just to see where my stuff ends up.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     Jure
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as a head of front-end development. I really admire what Jure and his team have done so far and it will be a real challenge to keep up with his tempo. I’m also looking forward to solving problems that will make our extension, which I’m sure you already have, even more friendly and useful. Hopefully some of those problems will result in content on this blog that is worth reading.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the meantime I have few days of vacation that will hopefully be spent on resting and cleaning up various tasks that pilled up in last few months.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A while ago I tried to trigger an AJAX call to server in
    &lt;em&gt;
     onunload
    &lt;/em&gt;
    handler and failed miserably. It simply didn’t work in major browsers and I filled the idea under can’t-be-done.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I recently got another reason to revisit this problem and came up with a new-old idea. Since in my case I don’t care about server response, I don’t actually need XMLHttpRequest. Any technique that triggers a call to server is good enough, so why not try creating an image and setting its
    &lt;em&gt;
     url
    &lt;/em&gt;
    attribute to appropriate value.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It turns out that this works almost everywhere. It worked pretty flawlessly in Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer, but it doesn’t work in Safari and Konqueror, which makes me think that KHTML/Webkit family of browsers in general don’t support it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is not its only limitation. Technique obviously works only for GET calls, which is frowned upon and generally dangerous for actions that change state. I also suspect it works less well on slower computers or networks so you might need to delay event handler ending by buying some time with needless processing after you’ve set
    &lt;em&gt;
     url
    &lt;/em&gt;
    attribute.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, it might be another useful hack to have if you can live with its limitations.
   &lt;/p&gt;

As a side note, if you live in Slovenia and someone sends you G1G1, be prepared to pay VAT also for the one that was bought abroad and shipped elsewhere. Yet another thing beyond my comprehension.

   &lt;p&gt;
    End of December is a time when I usually try to take stock of year behind and create semi-plausible goals for upcoming year. I didn’t used to do this until some day, a few years ago, I noticed that my twenties were gone. Since then it has become a habit that has served me well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My biggest achievement this year is successfully suing myself. If this sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. It would take too long to explain why I came to do this, but it goes to show how far you sometimes have to go to please some bureaucrat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I worked a lot, to the point of postponing all my last years plans and didn’t get much in return. I honestly can’t say I learned a lot and I achieved even less of what I’m proud of. This year has simply been a professional disappointment that I have no intention of repeating again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course I didn’t just wake up and discover my failures and failings. They’ve been apparent to me for a while and I spent a large part of last few months thinking about what interests me and what I want, can and will try to do. I tried to form my
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but failing to get specific enough I have decided to spend next year learning about and exploring my areas of interest and see what I can come up with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Creating content, while popular, still feels awkward and limited. As a
    &lt;a href="http://www.lego.com" title="Greatest toys ever"&gt;
     LEGO
    &lt;/a&gt;
    fan since childhood I want to see if I can come up with a set of metaphors and building blocks that yield great power of expression. The point isn’t a tool for a perfect expression of an idea as much as it is an adequate expression of most ideas. Polishing can and should come later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I got Beautiful Evidence by
    &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/"&gt;
     Edward Tufte
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a few days ago and it’s an astonishing book covering another topic I feel needs more (of my) attention. When we manage to create something, we often fail to present our ideas properly. Partly it’s our fault since we can’t help ourselves not to rely on forms and traditions that came before web. It’s also our tools fault. When all you have is a blog, everything has to be squeezed onto a timeline.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’re over-focusing on primary creations. As a reader I’m usually quite limited in what I can do with a piece. These days I can make a vague statement with voting or less vague one with a comment. I may also forward a find, but that’s about it. My actions are by and large limited to statements about a piece instead of interacting directly with it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m sure none of above mentioned problems is new or unexplored. Smart people out there have certainly done wonderful stuff I haven’t heard of yet. Any pointers are always welcome. So next year I’ll work less, learn more (about it) and spend time playing with ideas that might appear. Hopefully I’ll have something to show in year’s time. Who knows, with a bit of luck I might even have something useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But before I leave, let me wish everyone merry holidays and a happy new year.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been curious about interface possibilities and limitations of non-desktop environments like my Nokia tablet for a while, especially as they pertain to web. Pen on a touchscreen obviously doesn’t have to leave a “trail” of traversal like a mouse does. You also don’t have several mouse buttons at your disposal.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So I made a simple
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsenvtest.html"&gt;
     test page
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to see how some of more interesting events get caught.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The result on my 770 was quite disappointing while also expected. I’ll summarize it for those who don’t have a tablet. Touching a screen generates
    &lt;em&gt;
     mousemove
    &lt;/em&gt;
    event and sometimes
    &lt;em&gt;
     mouseover
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , but you never get a
    &lt;em&gt;
     mouseout
    &lt;/em&gt;
    event. If touched briefly enough, it’ll also generate
    &lt;em&gt;
     mousedown
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     mouseup
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     click
    &lt;/em&gt;
    event in this order.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You won’t get a
    &lt;em&gt;
     mousedown
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     mouseup
    &lt;/em&gt;
    events until
    &lt;em&gt;
     click
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . If you keep pressing the screen without moving, you’ll  get a context menu, but I found no way to get to
    &lt;em&gt;
     mousedown
    &lt;/em&gt;
    on its own. This means it’s impossible to create a “natural” drag and drop, which isn’t surprising, since same movement is already taken by browser for scrolling.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My test was limited to Nokia 770 tablet, but I doubt results would be much different elsewhere (Fry, can you check your tablet?). It would also be interesting to see what iPhone does, but since I don’t have it either, I can’t tell.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still I’ll need to rethink a widget for website I’m working on and keep this in mind for my next year project.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not a secret that Javascript is interpreted and not statically compiled. Personally I find this an advantage that is not used often enough. If you look around the Web you can find plenty of cases to prove this, but I’d like to add another example.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A few months ago I was developing a library which had a goal of providing an improved Javascript experience for standardized components without requiring any knowledge of the language to use. I also wanted to support different load scenarios so library could be smaller when needed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sadly I ran out of time before I ended my work to my satisfaction. Still, I’d like to discuss one approach that also demonstrates aspects that I’d like to see used more in the wild.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s start with a demo. I created two almost identical pages. Can you spot the difference between
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/richswitch/index.html" title="First demo"&gt;
     first
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/richswitch/index2.html" title="Second demo"&gt;
     second
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First one simply toggles visibility of the text, while second one does the same with a bit more style. If you look at files, you’ll notice that the only difference is that first calls
    &lt;em&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/richswitch/switch.js"&gt;
      switch.js
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and second uses
    &lt;em&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/richswitch/rswitch.js"&gt;
      rswitch.js
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Both files look the same because they are. In fact, it’s really just one file. Hard link to the rescue for us, Unixheads.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But first a small warning. This code is not production ready. I simplified it to keep example clear and concise. In that capacity I think it will do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Javascript basically consists of two functions. A
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.onload
    &lt;/em&gt;
    handler that’s triggered when page is loaded and an animation function attached to button. A
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.onload
    &lt;/em&gt;
    handler is a one trick pony. Its main idea is to find Javascript file in DOM and based on the name with which it was loaded set up the execution environment. This is just a fancy name (to make me look smart) for setting a global variable that is private to this name space and possibly loading a few additional resources, like YUI animation support in our case. It is also the first case where not being static helps. We can decide at run time what’s necessary and load only what we need.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I find
    &lt;em&gt;
     toggleVisible
    &lt;/em&gt;
    a tad bit more interesting and the reason is its
    &lt;em&gt;
     if
    &lt;/em&gt;
    statement. What happens when we include
    &lt;em&gt;
     switch.js
    &lt;/em&gt;
    in a page?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, variable
    &lt;em&gt;
     rich
    &lt;/em&gt;
    remains set to
    &lt;em&gt;
     false
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and YUI components don’t get loaded. This means
    &lt;em&gt;
     YAHOO.util
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and its descendants aren’t defined. Yet as we’ve seen from first demo page script works just fine. Reason for this is that
    &lt;em&gt;
     if
    &lt;/em&gt;
    statement in
    &lt;em&gt;
     toggleVisible
    &lt;/em&gt;
    evaluates to
    &lt;em&gt;
     false
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and those undefined statements never get reached. This wouldn’t work in a language like Java, which would notice a call to undefined methods at compile time and refuse to finish compile, but it works perfectly fine in Javascript.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course if rich was set true, then we load YUI files. It might happen with this code that we press button before they get loaded, which is one of the reasons why this isn’t a production quality code, but if we assume for a moment that they did, then those same lines in
    &lt;em&gt;
     toggleVisible
    &lt;/em&gt;
    are perfectly fine and it works as hopefully seen on second page.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We therefore have a page where we control its behavior and size only by the way we call javascript file. There’s literally only one letter of difference. With dynamic loading of resources and cordoning potentially nonexistent methods we could fairly easily create a spectrum of possibilities where our users could choose their own compromise between functionality and its price in terms of page size and speed or better handle differences between mobile and desktop browsers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    I was however reminded again of a premise I’ve been thinking about every since
    &lt;a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/"&gt;
     Andy Clarke’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    talk at @media 2006. Should websites look and behave the same way in all mainstream browsers or not?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been flipping my opinion on this through time, but it seems to me striving for same experience everywhere is not only tiresome, time consuming but also strategically counter-productive.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If a site works the same in all browsers, what incentives do browser laggards have to upgrade their browser?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not many if any. I think same experience for everyone approach has other downsides as well. New features should be tested before they can be standardized and by tested I mean used. Otherwise we’re left to perpetually build to the lower common denominator. Just like we do now and it simply sucks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are arguments in favor of same experience everywhere. In my opinion most sensible one is that a significantly different experience between browsers can be confusing to users. I do, however, think this is not worth worrying about.  In my experience, which is what I use when lacking better source of data, people in general don’t use multiple browsers. Those who do, will cope by either sticking to one browser per site or adjusting to differences. We’re not as dumb as we behave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to despise “best seen on” or “optimized for” signs on websites and I still do when they mean they only work with a specified browser. I don’t think there’s anything wrong if website doesn’t shut out anyone, but it’s a bit nicer to some. In fact it’s what we already profess and do. We certainly don’t test all browsers that we used to even though there are still people using them. Not only don’t we test, we KNOW our sites don’t work the same in them. And if we already know and do this, why not also promote a better choice if we think there is one?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what I’m trying to say without getting too deep into why is that I’ll try to build sites open to users of all browsers, but won’t be too timid to offer improved features when consistency is too difficult or impossible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve recently read couple of posts that left an impression on me. First one was Brad Neuberg’s about
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I haven’t completed list of my problems yet, but I came far enough to know I’m not working on any of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other one was about
    &lt;a href="http://www.entrepreneur2be.com/2007/08/26/idea-blog-socialnetworking-blog20/"&gt;
     Blog 2.0
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m more interested in content manipulation than social interactions as Pownce and Marela are only two social networking applications I use. Still, ideas contained are intriguing and couple of days before
    &lt;a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/"&gt;
     Data Sharing Summit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is the right time to shamelessly pimp my views.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Build a social application and you will likely, sooner or later, encounter a dilemma in what your members will be building. Are their creations mainly personal, an expression of their creativity, or are they more of a place where people meet and engage?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most websites don’t fall squarely into one or the other. My blog feels personal not only because I picked the look and topics, but also because my voice is elevated above others. I doubt I would feel the same if comments could look like my posts. I like my place and freedom it offers me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why I don’t care all that much about most networks and degrees of their openness. Really open social network would be interwoven into the fabric of web. I already have my page, I don’t need yet another one. If buddy list is desired, I can use FOAF. Sharing of my stuff? Feeds. Same answer for getting other people’s stuff. Starting a new network would mean creating a widget or a few that can be easily integrated in our sites, maybe some sort of a pinging service if expediency is important and offering a space for personal page for those, who don’t have it yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s amazing how little would need to be changed to implement ideas in Blog 2.0. Basic technology is already here, it’s just not used widely enough yet. Sure there are a few issues that need to be thought through, mainly to do with handling privacy correctly, but they are neither big nor really technological. And price for all this?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Maybe a bit less expediency in content propagation and a bit more work for network operators, who might need to learn to live with the same limitations that search engine developers do already. And I’m not even sure that is really necessary.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/em&gt;
    Thinking a bit more about this I would be happy enough if social network were just more inclusive. It’s fine that you can create an account and be busy on their platform, but it would be better if you could join and interact with a social network with your own node for as long as that met your needs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a week with a lot of novelty. I got a new monitor, a nice 21″ LCD and it seemed appropriate to install a more recent, so to speak new, Linux distribution to go with it. I decided for Kubuntu and so far I quite like it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been a Linux user for more than a decade, but for last few years I haven’t really used my machine for everyday browsing. One reason were bookmarks accumulated in my powerbook and the other absence of Flash plugin for x86-64 platform. Flash plugin is still missing, but clever folks contrived a way to use the i386 one. Basically you install compatibility libraries and another, 32 bit version of Firefox.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I mostly use the one without a plugin and so far it has certainly been an eye opening experience. Once upon a time sites fell in two categories, those made more or less completely with Flash and others, which didn’t use it at all. I have no idea when this changed, but it’s certainly not true anymore. These days most sites seem to be combination of both approaches.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As with Javascript it can work quite nicely when used sensibly and in an unobtrusive way. However, there are lots of sites like
    &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/"&gt;
     this
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which you simply can’t use without Flash. With proliferation of video and widgets, that play ever more important roles, I feel that web is becoming less open with every day.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I probably wouldn’t mind that much if Flash player itself was open (I don’t really care about development tools). Well, when all else fails,  you can always hope.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been following sporadically discussions about opening and sharing social networks’ social graphs. It’s hard to be a user of web services these days and not wish it was easier to recreate network of friends on new ones. Following sporadically means my opinion on subject may be more firm than right. I guess that makes it a perfect blogging material.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Latest article I’ve read on the subject
    &lt;a href="http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/"&gt;
     comes
    &lt;/a&gt;
    from Brad Fitzpatrick, someone always worth listening to. It’s an interesting post and Brad has obviously thought about privacy issues, but there’s one conceptual problem I still don’t see resolved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It sounds paradoxical, but I don’t think public and private data have an empty intersection. If for some reason you want to have a pseudonymous account on social network cooperating in this scheme, how can you reliably avoid being discovered? If you, for example, use same email address as with other services, then anyone using social graph data can find you out by matching hash values.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The only solution I can think of is to use a different email address, but this is neither particularly scalable and you have to decide upfront about how you intent to use the service. It also won’t work for sites, where you are already registered. There you can only hope you’ll be asked for consent before that data is given out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I’m more or less convinced that sharing will happen. Current situation is simply to painful for everyone involved (apart from biggest players) to persevere. I just don’t know what the downsides will be to which I’ll have to adapt.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Alas, there’s no point in purchase when there is no free time to do the hacking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No free time also means forgetting self-imposed deadline for rewriting this blog and having to put up with it for quite some time longer. That is, if there will also be enough time to do some writing. For better or worse I am not giving up hope on that yet.

    Andy is among many feeling
    &lt;a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/06/whither_w3c/index.php"&gt;
     frustrated
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with slow progress of CSS3 specifications and role W3C plays or should play in their birth. Having no part in any standardization process with corresponding amount of experience in developing a specification, I’m certainly ill qualified for comment on it with any reasonable amount of certainty.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am, for better or worse, a blogger and I was at WWW2007, so I do have an opinion that like any true blogger find irresistible not to share even if it is in all likelihood wrong. In short, I believe the current state is a result of fairly insignificant intersection between people feeling the pain and those able to do much about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At first we wanted to present information and nineties were largely spent developing tools to do so in efficient enough manner. Partial browser stagnation, Mozilla development and CSS2 together with HTML4/XHTML1 more or less brought it far enough that we started having bigger dreams, wanting to do new stuff with our data. Just displaying it on a page doesn’t feel enough anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    These days there is a lot of talk about semantic web, which doesn’t mean same to all people, but is mostly understood as adding meaning to published outputs in ways friendlier to later manipulation and hence more useful. Tools ranging from feeds and microformats to SPARQL might be different, but most are marching in same direction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This doesn’t mean that current set of standards are perfect, but they are good enough that most of W3C doesn’t see them as a still open problem and has moved on to work on other more important things. You can probably listen to Tim Berners-Lee for hours these days without him muttering words HTML or CSS. They are also good enough for general public, which doesn’t care much about how something is done as long as it appears to work, to get what it wants.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are approximately as many Pandas in world as developers with a sense of esthetics, so it is hardly surprising that people bothered enough with current state to complain are mainly designers who care about doing things right. Sadly they are not usually well represented in standards bodies and as mentioned there isn’t an outside pressure that could compensate.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The only hope I see for new push comes from browser makers who probably don’t want be relegated to a part of an easily replaceable platform for running Flash/Silverlight/Whathaveyou plugins. Hopefully money flowing to them from search engines is good enough to finance a greater effort than one done so far.

    I added Google ads (again), but with a bit of a twist. They can be seen only on posts at least two months old, so they don’t annoy my few regular readers and are seen only by fly-by visitors, who’ll never return again. Since they are the same people who come to this site by searching for something, it’s also more likely that ads will be beneficial to them. So in a way we all win or at least nobody loses (much). If you think the idea sounds too good to be mine, well, you’re right. It isn’t. It’s

    It’s an expected fact of a geek life that interesting technologies and gadgets appear when you don’t have either means or time to play with them. No surprise then that
    &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html"&gt;
     Google Gears
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was announced exactly at such a time for me. As you’ve probably read elsewhere, Google Gears is a browser extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer (with Safari coming up) which lets developers create web applications that can also run offline on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Google isn’t the first company doing something like this. Adobe has Apollo, Microsoft is working on its own thing, Mozilla added support for offline storage in version 2 of the fox and there are some less well known attempts like Dojo’s. What makes it special are few things.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First, unlike Apollo or Firefox, it’s not a special environment and it’s as cross-browser and cross-platform as it gets these days. Google is also trying to build an industry support for this and Adobe already
    &lt;a href="http://shebanation.com/2007/05/30/google-gears/"&gt;
     announced
    &lt;/a&gt;
    it will support Gears API in Apollo. Same has
    &lt;a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/audible-ajax-episode-21-dojo-offline-on-google-gears"&gt;
     already been done
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Dojo Toolkit. There’s also
    &lt;a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/05/30/19.06.10/#comments"&gt;
     an intention
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to make it an open standard by submitting proposal to WHATWG/W3C (and hopefully them accepting it).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I can’t wait to play with WorkerPool API (which seems to be overlooked in all the excitement). Having a possibility of running time-intensive operations in a background without the fear of triggering “unresponsive script” dialog is a wish come true. Even though you can’t access objects
    &lt;em&gt;
     document
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and

    (and hence any part of the DOM). Reason for this is that background scripts don’t share any execution state and hence can’t all access unique objects like aforementioned ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This might limit usefulness of the API somewhat, but there are still plenty of uses that come to my mind. What also comes to my mind is a problem, that isn’t really technological. Web applications gave impression to public of being fairly safe to use even on public computers (which isn’t really true) and I fear many won’t understand that new tools may now store private data where they don’t expect or want them to.

   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s getting more and more horrible to travel around with planes. Senseless airport rules or those which benefit only airport employees can still get me angry even days after return home. These days I wouldn’t dare to change planes at Heathrow unless I had at least two hours to do so and would need at least 3 hours not to be nervous about it. Still, there’s a positive side to it. It makes coming through the home door a happier event.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Somehow I don’t mind the actual waiting at the airport. On our last trip we, my wife and I, waited several hours for our next flight which gave us ample time to sit in cafeterias and observe functioning of an airport.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We watched couple of men loading luggage on a plane and unsurprisingly they didn’t handle suitcases gently. Our fairly new samsonite is a witness that this is quite common and I don’t expect it to last for more than a few more years unless we reduce amount of traveling we do. Still, I was astonished to see how far they can throw big heavy suitcases. It certanly can’t be good for their backs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looking at flying luggage got me thinking. Wouldn’t it be better if the whole process of loading and unloading bags could be mostly if not completely automated?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It could be done the same way as it was done with ship containers. Just standardize a few sizes in which all suitcases would come and build airplane cargo areas that take those sizes into an account. I believe you could handle most luggage completely automatically and use human gorillas only for pieces that don’t fit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You could also stimulate adoption with appropriate weight or pricing benefits for those who would use such luggage. This way we’d all win. Or is there something I’m missing?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www2007.org/"&gt;
     WWW2007
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is wrapping up tomorrow, but today is the last day I am attending. It’s been really refreshing to be at a web oriented gathering without hearing anybody say: “Web 2.0″.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I enjoyed listening to talks and learned that I have to brush up my math and maybe learn a new thing or two. I still learned a lot despite my personal shortcomings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My original reason for attending was
    &lt;a href="http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2007/"&gt;
     AIRWeb07
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a workshop on adversarial information retrieval on web, because I wanted to learn what anti-spam community is working on and what sort of ideas and tools are being discussed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The answer to an outsider like me seems mainly to be a problem of web spam polluting search engines and algorithms trying to discover spam pages from graphs of connected pages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is a very simplified description, probably even too simplified, and I have to say that I admire the work and ideas done and shown at the conference. At the same time I was very surprised that focus has been so much on links and practically none on characteristics of spam pages themselves (with notable exception of a submission by
    &lt;a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/"&gt;
     Gordon Cormack
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ). I understand that crawlers are somewhat out of vogue in research community, but it still seemed kind of odd.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is as if someone trying to know me would completely ignore what I say and solely concentrate on who am I hanging out with and how do I go about it. It seemed to me that the best way would be to combine both, which is what prof. Cormack proposed as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a way I think I may understand this focus. It’s very easy to add spam links on an open participatory web and obviously nobody can control what gets published on all those pages out there. So it’s natural for search companies to concentrate on points that they do control, like their index.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I feel as if not enough has been done on preventing stuff like comment spam. Better tools would only lead to more isolated spam pages and therefore to an easier extraction of spam networks from an index.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then again, I don’t do this kind of research for a living and may be only talking nonsense.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other thing that’s been on my mind is a general agreement that this is an arms race and one which won’t be won unless financial incentives driving spammers can be eliminated. Question came up if we should try to break our own protections (as cryptographers do) and how would we fare?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have no doubt that people I met fighting spam are much smarter than most of their opponents, which is why I don’t doubt that they could do it. I doubt only if they should do it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not really intuitive that the best thing in an arms race would be to show the other side how to build a nuke. Especially when it seems we are busy enough fighting problem in its current variations. Then again, I’m not convinced it’s a bad idea either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I won’t go much into other talks, as I feel even less qualified to judge and anyone can get a better insight just by reading accepted papers that are all available online. What I heard or read has been in general of a high quality and if this year is anything to go by, then try to attend next one, which will be next April in Beijing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By the way, visiting Banff is a must even without a conference as an excuse, since the place and even more its surroundings are just stunning. And if you do decide to go, do yourself a favor and contact
    &lt;a href="http://www.tarry.ca/"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m still a fan of OpenID, even though it lacks solid solutions to some of its problems.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Much has been said about risk of phishing and possible solutions, but I’ve been more ignorant than some to a transient nature of OpenID identities. Simply put, even if you run your own server, you don’t own your domain. You just rent it. Thus you don’t really own your OpenID URL either, which makes it a rather risky tool where some sort of permanent identity is needed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are plenty of cases where there’s no such need and OpenID is in my opinion a better solution to them than existing ones. But it isn’t good enough where something less fleeting is required. Maybe
    &lt;a href="http://www.xdi.org/"&gt;
     XRI/XDI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is a better answer?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t know. I’m still a fan of OpenID. It’s just a bit less useful than I first thought.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    People make mistakes and that’s why we log every error that happens on
    &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si" title="Photo-sharing website"&gt;
     Marela
    &lt;/a&gt;
    pages or its API. I imagine most services that care about quality do more or less the same, since it is a great way to find yet undiscovered bugs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s an additional benefit when it comes to an API. You can also get an insight in what developers would like to do and how they go about doing it. With a bit of care you may even correct badly designed calls before they get too widely adopted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What may not be as obvious is that not all calls are equal and some of them probably need more careful reporting. A good example would be failed authentication attempts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Marela is one of services supported by
    &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3945"&gt;
     Fotofox
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a popular photo sharing Firefox add-on, which is great. However support for multiple different services invariably leads to a problem, where users send their usernames and passwords to the wrong site. We weren’t prepared for this and our first reaction was to simply religiously delete all such reports from our logs to prevent any possibility of an abuse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think this was wrong, so we changed it. Probably the best way is to record failed authentication attempts the way Unix systems do, by logging just username that was used in an attempt and its success, while ignoring provided password completely. This way we still obtain valuable information while protecting data that we clearly shouldn’t have access to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is of course just an example. My main point is that a sufficiently large API will have calls with different privacy needs and API designers should think carefully about what needs to be recorded in service logs and what mustn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

     this article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Tomaž interesting. And since I keep being asked what I think of Macs as well, I’ll unwisely share a few of my thoughts on the subject. But before I proceed, I’d like to state as a regular Linux/Windows/Mac/Symbian user:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “All operating systems suck. A lot. They just suck in their own special ways.”
    &lt;a href="#macs-1"&gt;
     &lt;sup&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/sup&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Keywords being ALL, SUCK and A LOT. You just have to find the one that sucks least for what you want to do. The flip side to this is that all of them have useful features, some of which I wish other operating systems had too. You can get work done, albeit with some degree of pain, with any of them. So it’s not all bad either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In this home, we have way too many computers and my dear wife, if you’re reading this, I deeply apologize for this.  I’m working on slimming them down, but this is harder to do for a geek than keeping weight during Christmas. Anyway, if my counting is not off, then there are between 7 and 10 computers in this house, depending on how big and powerful the thing has to be to qualify. Two of them are now a bit dated macs running Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A short, unordered and incomplete list of things that I dislike about Mac or just disagree with Tomaž:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Mac software certainly has install wizards, but it’s true they are not as common as on Windows. Still, nice when they are absent.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     My powerbook is the most moody piece of hardware I ever had. If I want to reduce the risk of a crash at wake up, I have to reproduce the state at which it was put to sleep as close as possible. Still, this gets me from a wake-up crash almost every time to a crash or two per month.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I’m sure the problem lies with my particular specimen, but if Apple’s diagnostic software can’t find the problem, then it doesn’t exist as far as Apple is concerned.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Living in Slovenia means that if it does find the problem or the computer breaks down, then you’ll be likely without a computer for about 4 weeks while it’s getting shipped around Europe and repaired; I wouldn’t buy a computer that I can miss for such a long period of time. I wish I knew this when I bought mine.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Closing application window doesn’t close application itself. Except when it does.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Hiding application (cloverleaf-H) is a neat way to hide an application, when it works. At least once a week I jettison my Safari windows and tabs because it doesn’t always work.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     For some reason it keeps offering me czech keyboard layout and funnily, it did this just now. I might have understood turkish, on account of my surname, but czech?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Slovenian keyboard layout is simply wrong. Originality is all fine and dandy, but this is not a place to differentiate yourself.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     A complete uninstall of an application which includes user settings is a tedious and error prone affair. Wouldn’t be a problem if the Library directory didn’t tend to balloon to absurd proportion through the years.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Machine seems getting progressively slower with same software as time marches on. It’s not the only system that suffers this fate, but it’s also true that not all of them do. These days using Safari on my Powerbook is an exercise in patience.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Finder, Mac’s file manager, is an abomination. It was probably great when it was conceived, but we don’t punch cards anymore.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Once a week I decline installation of iTunes 7. I’ve been doing this for months, since there’s no option to stop bugging me with this forever. I guess I’ll be doing this for months or years, until this machine dies or I start declining iTunes 8.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Proprietary formats are pure evil when there are reasonable alternatives and Mac is littered with them. iPhoto is an untrustworthy piece of crap that ate my (meta)data and blurs images when rotating. Mark
     &lt;a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks"&gt;
      was (is)
     &lt;/a&gt;
     still right.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short, Mac just works, except when it doesn’t or when it stops. Having said that it might be the perfect computer for you, even though it’s clearly not for me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yahoo recently
    &lt;a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/02/22/free-yui-hosting/"&gt;
     announced
    &lt;/a&gt;
    free public hosting of YUI library, just like AOL
    &lt;a href="http://blog.dojotoolkit.org/2006/01/30/dojo-iamalpha-and-cdns"&gt;
     did
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a while ago for Dojo toolkit. A great move. You don’t have to pay bandwidth for hosting YUI and there’s a better likelihood that scripts will already be in visitors browser cache, since some other previously visited page might have used them too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However there’s a real downside to it. What happens if Yahoo servers are unaccessible or connection to them is just slow?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you’re lucky, then its former and the page will be rendered quickly but with some (javascript) functionality missing. If later, then it might take forever to render a page since modern browsers can’t and won’t do it until all javascript has been loaded.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This might seem an unlikely scenario, unless you’ve been around the last time when access problems to Google Analytics stopped displaying a large part of slovenian web, least important of which being this very blog. Yahoo is not stupid, but neither is Google and problem can literally appear anywhere between their servers and your visitors computer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what can be done if this possibility is not acceptable to you, but you’d still want to use free hosting?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nothing pretty it seems. The only thing that I can think of is to add local links to yui, put them together with Yahoo links at the bottom of the page and trigger Javascript when content has been loaded. Then you only have to wait for YUI objects to appear before you start processing your scripts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This way you can probably avoid crippled or blank pages, but you’re still paying for the bandwidth. Unless of course you go one step further and include local links only when Yahoo objects don’t appear in a reasonable amount of time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Does anyone have any idea how to solve this problem gracefully?
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been more than a month since I got my Nokia 770. In that time, I went through numerous spontaneous reboots, which culminated in one never ending reboot loop after an unsuccessful software install in which I lost my Mahjong best times and a collection of ideas for a project at work. I can’t make it connect to company wireless (although at home it works just fine) and built in email client is a piece of crap that barely satisfies the need to check email. There’s no good way to synchronize data (address book etc.) with other devices and I see no reason why included editor can’t handle any text file.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet, I absolutely love this gadget to the point, where my wife jokes about being jealous.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about this ever since I flashed the device yesterday. Why is it so alluring to me?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Gadgets are not living beings and there’s no charm in their faults. There certainly are many of them, but there’s also a lot to like. Display is fantastic and reading web pages or pdf files finally doesn’t hurt. Those two tasks were the reason I bought it in the first place, so it’s performing its main function quite well. I like the way I can transform it in a little computer with a portable bluetooth keyboard
    &lt;br/&gt;
    that lets me do practically anything. I don’t play games much, but I like those available. I was fine with declared battery time and I’m
    &lt;br/&gt;
    absolutely delighted my 770 like a Duracell bunny easily exceeds it. I’ve got a feeling I can make it do whatever I want, limited mostly by my practically non-existent free time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess I like it so much simply because getting more than expected is good enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I stumbled upon a
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Europe_map_1648.PNG"&gt;
     map of Europe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in the middle of 17th century while reading about
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus"&gt;
     Jan Hus
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe"&gt;
     John Wycliffe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and was surprised to learn how foreign it was to me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m a big fan of Google Earth (and Maps), but the thing that I don’t like is that I can only look at most recent information Google has. Normally this is what I want, but not always. I like the fact that
    &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=ljubljana&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;ll=45.762523,14.367714&amp;amp;spn=0.029101,0.083685&amp;amp;t=k&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" title="Map of Cerknica lake"&gt;
     photos
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of Cerknica lake were taken during one of seasonal droughts, since it makes it easy to find streams and sinks that are gone when lake is full of water. But what will happen if new photos will be taken when lake is full?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Information I can access now will be gone and I’ll only be able to wait for a better luck in the future. Google (and other map providers) have provided good tools for moving around three dimensions, but I’d like to be able to move in fourth as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Wouldn’t it be nice, if you could see how a place is changing through time or how did states change through centuries?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem is not so much technical as it is of information gathering. Obviously it’s getting harder (even impossible) to get reliable data  as you go further back in history, but that’s hardly a reason not to try at all. If you’d be interested in working on map of Europe of last couple of millennia, please let me know.

    and I never regretted this decision. In fact, I have had so much fun I couldn’t imagine to go and work for some other company ever again.

    I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who’s a recent Python convert and he was explaining to me which parts of Python are not to his liking. Mostly he had reasonable objections.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can understand his wish for strong typing, but since lack of it is not a problem that affected me yet, I’m not bothered by it. I’ll take his word that objects pickled on Windows are not transferable to Linux and that certainly can suck. But it was probably the smallest problem that resonated the strongest with me, since it was something that has annoyed me previously.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Bisect module doesn’t let you specify comparison function. It obviously doesn’t need to, since you can define your own comparison methods on your classes, but still, it would be nice if its documentation included a hint for those who won’t look at module’s code or think of simply trying. You know, people like me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It got me thinking that I don’t find all modules in standard library of the same quality and I suspect I’m not the only one. I don’t mean to or honestly can disparage anyone, since I haven’t seen any code in standard library that would be worse than mine.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, which modules do you think would benefit from some work and how could an eager person, with some time on his hands, help them improve?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href="handling-404.html"&gt;
     Simon
    &lt;/a&gt;
    proposes using a dictionary to match mistyped URLs with real ones. I’d probably like the idea better if I actually understood it. Still using
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" title="description of the algorithm"&gt;
     Levenshtein
    &lt;/a&gt;
    can be a bit easier than using a spell checker responsively.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Easier, but slow. I used existing
    &lt;a href="http://hetland.org/python/distance.py" title="python implementation"&gt;
     implementation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Magnus Lie Hetland and made a test with 245 blog titles using a simple
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/distance/test_distance" title="Link to test script"&gt;
     script
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . 100 iterations on aging powerbook produced:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-indent:20pt;"&gt;
    1.766s, 29.152s, 9.399s (min, max, avg)
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Average time to calculate distance between randomly chosen title and rest of them is 9.4 seconds, which is far too much to be useful. And there’s not even 250 of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are two obvious ways to speed things up. Since minimum distance is at least as much as a difference in length of both strings, there’s no point in calculating it when difference already exceeds a limit we chose.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other trick took into an account that Levenshtein’s algorithm of two strings of comparable length has complexity of O(n2) and that my blog titles are form quite sparse space. If strings are longer than a certain limit (I arbitrarily chose 10 letters), then first calculate edit distance on a small sparse substring and then calculate the real distance only if first one was close enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When I made 1000 iterations of randomly chosen title using only first test, I got following results:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-indent:20pt;"&gt;
    0.003s, 0.284s, 0.167s (min, max, avg)
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, if I used both checks, the same 1000 iteration test got me:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-indent:20pt;"&gt;
    0.003s, 0.162s, 0.027s (min, max, avg)
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So,
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/distance/distance.py" title="Extended distance functions"&gt;
     two simple checks
    &lt;/a&gt;
    can speed up search up to 350 times. Not bad, but I’m not happy. This is certainly fast enough for a personal website or sites where site structure effectively divides searching to relatively small sets of possible hits, but there are plenty of sites where it would be too slow.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tried to simplify searching using distance to map strings to coordinate system, which was at least hopelessly naive if not downright dumb. A much better approach would be to read more, which is what I’m doing now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By the way, I’ve also tried to speed it up using Pyrex, but got pretty much same results, which means I either don’t know how to use Pyrex or Python optimizes well. Or both.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This blog doesn’t use descriptive URLs, which is not the only time I screwed this up for no good reason. In this case it was mainly laziness and smug i-don’t-care-if-people-find-me attitude, but I hadn’t really realized how stupid this decision was until I started thinking about the problem of missing pages (error 404).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It always bugged me how useless most 404 pages are. Sure, I could notify the webmaster about a broken link, but that won’t help me find what I’m looking for. Can’t we do better than that?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As it happens we often can.  There’s an unlimited number of ways in which visitors can fail to reach their destination, but majority of them probably fall in four categories:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     content moved elsewhere
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     broken links
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     typos
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     bad memory recall
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Content moved elsewhere
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Many believe that pages should be permanent and links shouldn’t break over time. Yet sometimes we either have little control over this or there are good reasons for breakage. We should still try to mitigate such situation by guiding visitors to correct new location when possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is done with HTTP redirects. If content was moved only temporary, then response should have a status code of 302 and contain a link in the header to correct current address. If move was permanent, then the same thing is achieved with code 301.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Missing pages amount to around 0.6% of hits on this website. They would be around 8% if redirects weren’t used.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Broken links
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Broken links appear when email clients break URL longer than maximum line length or from botched copy operation. This usually means that address is cut off and part we have is incomplete, but otherwise correct. Handling such links can range from trivial to impossible. Let’s look at one Wikipedia link as an example:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-indent:20pt;"&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem" title="Link to article about longest common sequence problem"&gt;
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s say that link was broken near the end of it and there was
    &lt;em&gt;
     lem
    &lt;/em&gt;
    missing in
    &lt;em&gt;
     problem
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Resulting address might not be complete, but there probably aren’t that many Wikipedia articles where such string forms first part of their address and it would be reasonable to assume that Wikipedia could find the right article. Alas it doesn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other side of the spectrum are impossible or almost impossible guesses. If address was broken anywhere before
    &lt;em&gt;
     Longest
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , then we could learn nothing from it about visitors expectations. This would look like a good place to give up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, if we are lucky, then our visitors came from one of popular search engines, which means their referrer attribute includes search string that led to our page. We can extract those keywords, use them and hopefully find that page or failing that offer a list of related pages. Not perfect, but beats plain “Not here” sign.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Typos
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Typos are what happens when people use keyboards. I can’t live without one, but I still recognize that my fingers and my brain are not always of the same mind about how to spell a word. Letters get added, dropped or just switch places, all being a problem for a program that usually looks for that one perfect match.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s help. Edit distance algorithms, like
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" title="Description of Levenshteins algorithm"&gt;
     Levenshtein’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , can be used to measure how similar two strings really are. Matching then becomes finding the page with shortest distance from a list of its closest neighbors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Downside is that algorithm is fairly computationally expensive and it might take time to find a match. I’ll explore this problem in tomorrows article.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Bad memory requests
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The main purpose of descriptive URLs is the same as catchy domain names. Make it easy to remember address for later use, when bookmarks or browsers autocomplete can’t be used.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But memory is notoriously unreliable and it doesn’t work any better with web addresses. So addresses used may vary enough from the right one that they don’t get caught with edit distance algorithms. As an example, someone might try to access aforementioned Wikipedia’s article with:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-indent:20pt;"&gt;
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_subsequence_problem
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Calculated distance between this address and the real one is 7, which is probably more than would be real limit for matching. We can still look at referrer for clues, but we can also use requested address. In our case, we can extract keywords
    &lt;em&gt;
     longest
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     subsequence
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     problem
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and use them to search for possible hits. Wikipedia doesn’t do this either, but neither do I, so I shouldn’t complain.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Time to wrap it up
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe this approaches make a good case for logical and descriptive addresses, since most of them don’t work (well) otherwise. If someone requests an article with a nonexistent ID 145, it’s impossible to resolve which of existing ones with IDs 155, 245 or 149 he really wanted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, sometimes descriptive addresses are not an option. I’d love to hear ideas or practical experience of how to handle such cases.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    Every year I spend a few weeks somewhere where internet connection is either slow or metered and expensive. Usually it’s both which makes me rather twitchy when it comes to big web page sizes. Yet I’m also certain that my new web home, however it may turn out at the end, will have a significant chunk of it written in Javascript. None of it necessary for working, but more than I’d probably like to download over flimsy mobile phone connection.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem are not really old mobile browsers which don’t support Javascript. They won’t download any of it anyway. The question is how to prevent eager browsers, who would, from downloading this stuff when you don’t want them to. My first, rather primitive attempt was
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/envcheck/index.html" title="Demo of javascript ondemand loading depending on media"&gt;
     this demonstration
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which only works in Opera 9, Safari and Firefox, but most certainly doesn’t work in all browsers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What it does is check font size of a title and based on its value resolves which media style sheet was used. If it was
    &lt;em&gt;
     mobile.css
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , which is used only when media is set to
    &lt;em&gt;
     handheld
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , then it was probably done from a mobile environment, so it includes the mobile version of a Javascript or it could, if I wanted, none at all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are several problems with this approach. First one is that it doesn’t recognize notebook users connecting over a  cellphone. It can’t really, since browser environment is literally the same, unless it would try to measure latency and bandwidth of page elements and guess from those results, which is neither easy nor reliable. 3G networks can be rather fast and have a better latency than a wired connection from somewhere like Tanzania.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But let’s say we don’t care about this case. We can always turn Javascript off in Firefox if it’s important enough to us, which leads us to the next problem. Support for handheld media type is still rather spotty. If browser doesn’t support it, it may load the wrong style sheet if any at all and the wrong CSS value results in wrong turn in Javascript. However
    &lt;em&gt;
     handheld media
    &lt;/em&gt;
    support is getting better. Since I decided from the start that my personal page is a good place where leading edge can also be a bit of bleeding one, that is good enough. On a different site this probably wouldn’t be true.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So it sort of works in principle, but it is crude and error prone. Javascript check is not self-contained and I could easily break it by changing font size value of a title in CSS files while forgetting to do a corresponding correction in code. What would be much better is to learn from the browser which media types style sheets were actually used and act accordingly. Now that would be grand.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are two ways you could go about this. My first go was finding style nodes in DOM and looking at their
    &lt;em&gt;
     disabled
    &lt;/em&gt;
    property, which is commonly used in style sheet switchers for turning sheets on and off. It doesn’t work, since ‘wrong’ media types in Firefox are ignored, not disabled. Their
    &lt;em&gt;
     disabled
    &lt;/em&gt;
    value is still set to
    &lt;em&gt;
     false
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A proper way of doing it would be using DOM Style Sheets methods. Basic idea is to compare actual values as set in the page with values read from style sheets and resolving which ones were used. While not exactly trivial, by little forethought it can be made to work fine in Opera and Firefox. It can also work in Explorer using its own methods, but it’s a pain to make it  work in Safari, which in this case is not only an incompetent liar, it’s also lying in some weird accent. If you’d like to learn more about it, then there’s a
    &lt;a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domstylesheets" title="Problems with DOM Style Sheets use"&gt;
     great
    &lt;/a&gt;
    page describing current state but the gist of it is that you can’t rely on methods being there and even when they are, in some form or another, they might not work reliably (Safari) or might produce weird results (yup, Safari again).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, it could still work, but would require an unreasonable amount of code. Hence I made a different tradeoff, which can be seen
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/envcheck/index2.html" title="Second attempt"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . A bit less automation for a lot less code. It keeps the idea of first demo with a small twist. First rule of every media style sheet targets the same element that gets created by Javascript if necessary and compares its font size value with those found in style sheets. It returns media types of all sheets where this value was found.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The end result certainly isn’t perfect or pretty, but it keeps amount of bookkeeping to minimum and limited to CSS files. Even using a “safe” property like font size can lead to problems (e.g. 0.9em is sometimes interpreted as 0.90em), but nothing difficult to overcome.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It might not be of production quality, but it will work as good starting point for further exploration.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    There’s hardly a worse way to end a vacation than catching a flu. There are also better starts to flu then midnight spells of vomiting, when your stomach is completely empty. All you do is spit acid and brush teeth afterwards in hope they might stick around a bit longer.

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The good thing is that it beats catching malaria, which I hopefully didn’t, and that it only gets better onwards. I seem to be left only with a slight cold and a nasty
    &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;censored&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    problem that I’m hoping will disappear in next few days. I’m almost through my unread emails as well so if you’ve sent me something and haven’t heard from me yet, this would be a good time to send me a reminder.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    This vacation has been very much unlike the others. It was the first time in years, well, since I started working really, that I didn’t work at all while being on vacation. I didn’t think of work either, an odd experience I enjoyed with gusto.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Still, a long way home provided ample opportunity for reflection, hazy thoughts and dubious decisions one of which is that I’m going to rewrite this site and create my own publishing platform, which will be better suited than those known to me for things I need and things I’d like to try out.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I’ve also given myself a deadline, a year, in which to come up with this thing. A deadline that I think provides enough time to hope for sucess and not enough to slack.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    What won’t change is the low frequency of my posts, a belief strengthened by wading through hundreds of unread posts accumulated in my feed reader while I was gone, majority of which being little more than a waste of time. But who am I to complain.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been writing less lately, which had little to do with summer laziness and more with me thinking about publishing on the web.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Many have said that Internet (or Web) is not a television, but neither is it a magazine or a book. Yet I find myself again and again leaning on preconceptions picked up from my favorite medium. So this summer has been spent exploring my preconceived notions and trying to find out which of them still make sense on the web and how to tackle those which don’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And the result of this exploration? I still don’t like WordPress, so I might go about writing my own publishing platform which would offer me an opportunity to test some of newfound ideas. Or I won’t, recognizing vast amount of time needed and I’ll end up only writing an article or two. But what I’m certain I will do is write less.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a world where every monkey can publish so almost every one of us eventually does restraint is a virtue. There were too many posts that neither benefited me nor those who came across them. Maybe I won’t change the signal-noise ratio, but I will put less crap out there in absolute terms.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Related to all these thinking is a recent announcement of
    &lt;a href="http://hyperscope.org/"&gt;
     HyperScope
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Doug Engelbart’s vision of
    &lt;a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augment-132082.opml"&gt;
     Open Hyperdocument System
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (link may not work in every browser) has been a source of many ideas this summer and it’s certainly nice to finally have available a system to test at least some of them.

    It’s normal and expected that part of every industry’s terminology will look weird or even obtuse to outsiders. But when a music executive, in an otherwise very interesting

     offer
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I won’t be posting new widgets for a while. This last one, stemming from obviously borrowed idea, looks like this:

    &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s still very small (less than 7K) and still works in all major browsers. It even works (without a problem) in Safari and image selection collision code works too. If you like it, you can add it to your own page with:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;

    You should, as previously, replace:

    I need help. I’m looking to expand my horizons, learn something new and generally make positive and decisive steps to being less ignorant. I’d be most grateful, if you could help me, dear reader, by pointing out interesting and useful resources out there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The topics are not really important. I may be biased to deepening my knowledge of history and design, but every topic and more importantly, every resource is a good one as long as you personally find it interesting and it’s accessible to neophytes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is an exception to this. Resources about software and software development should be avoided unless they cover the field from a completely original point of view or were created by an author, who is raving mad. I’d prefer both, but later requirement probably already includes former.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t care about the form either as long as it’s fairly accessible. Books, blogs, podcasts, movies etc. are all fair game, but conferences with couple of thousand dollars entrance fees (or organized in USA) aren’t.

    I fairly often talk to developers with disdain for Javascript. I don’t blame them, since I used to share it. There are various reasons for it, some more valid than others, but one that almost never comes up is the very thing that bothers me most.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was reading about
    &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7" title="Introduction to Javascript 1.7"&gt;
     features
    &lt;/a&gt;
    promised for Javascript 1.7 which should be a part of Firefox 2.0 and I like lots of them. How wouldn’t I when only few of them can’t be found in Python.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The thing is, most of the time I have almost absolute control of which version of Python, Java or what have you I’ll use. But when your code lives inside of a browser, you’re pretty much stuck with what’s out there and if my experience is anything to go by then I won’t be using new features widely before next decade.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

    Heat is gone, work isn’t, but I still found time to have fun while shamelessly copying other people ideas.

    The result:

    &lt;script src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/doublerandom.js?username=markos&amp;amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;amp;time=3" type="text/javascript"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a simple widget for displaying two randomly chosen pictures with a given tag out of up to a hundred.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The widget was successfully tested in Internet Explorer 6, Firefox 1.0 and Opera 9.0. It only sort of works in Safari, but if this is good enough for you, you can add it to your own page by inserting:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/doublerandom.js?username=markos&amp;amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;amp;time=2"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You should, however, replace:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     my username (markos) with yours
    &lt;/li&gt;

     set time lag in seconds between image replacements
    &lt;/li&gt;

    I’m not quite happy with it yet. I’d like to fix Safari support and my code for avoiding two same images is still buggy. If you’d like to use the latest known working version, then use the link to my page. Otherwise you’re free to copy the contents of script’s directory.

    It’s the beginning of August, heat is temporarily gone and I wish it took work with it. But no, it’s still lying there and there’s enough of it that I have some problems deciding what to do first.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So how do you solve a problem like that?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I goof off by writing something fun (still more useful than reading blogs). For example a simple javascript file based on my
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/code/marela.html" title="link to Marela Javascript library"&gt;
     Marela library
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that allows me (or you) to insert a single random image from your chosen Marela photostream like this:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;script src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&amp;amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;amp;size=2" type="text/javascript"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you don’t believe me just reload this page and look at its source.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    See? Told you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to do the same, but don’t want to show my images on your page, just insert
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&amp;amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;amp;size=2"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    in your page and replace
    &lt;em&gt;
     markos
    &lt;/em&gt;
    with your Marela username (contact me, if you need an account) and
    &lt;em&gt;
     moja-izbira
    &lt;/em&gt;
    with your chosen tag. You can specify the size of an image with a number from 1 to 3 (2 being default if attribute is missing).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll write some more widgets like this through August, if I don’t change my mind. Hence the title of this post.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Also I’ll write Javascript for first 5 souls who need it as long as it’s a problem that won’t take too much of my time. This offer expires at the end of this month.

   &lt;/p&gt;

    with its

     scrollHeight
    &lt;/em&gt;
    on key presses and increment
    &lt;em&gt;
     rows
    &lt;/em&gt;
    attribute when former is smaller than later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But supporting Opera and Safari has proven to be an insurmountable task for now. They simply don’t seem to update any property that could reliably be used for measuring the height of the text (but would love to be proven wrong).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can try a
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/growtextarea/index.html"&gt;
     demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which also doubles as a test environment for reading interesting attributes on the fly (updates are done with mouse over input box).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Random bits of observation:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      scrollHeight
     &lt;/em&gt;
     is always bigger than
     &lt;em&gt;
      clientHeight
     &lt;/em&gt;
     in Opera. Hence the need to ignore it using its unique fingerprint.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I didn’t try to work out the length of the text by trying to count the number of lines (using
     &lt;em&gt;
      \n
     &lt;/em&gt;
     ) and the length of each of them. Proportional fonts prevent any such reasonable guess.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I didn’t try to limit the growth of the box to the boundaries of the screen. I find page scroll bars the least annoying when scroll bars can’t be avoided. It’s a personal choice though.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But I’ve been most pleased to discover something else. I gave
    &lt;a href="ajax-talk-at-nest.html" title="Link to talk announcement"&gt;

    recently and we spent quite some time discussing AJAX and Javascript accessibility issues. I wish I knew back then about
    &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML" title="Link to accessible DHTML implementation in Firefox 1.5"&gt;
     this
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not only is there a draft of a specification for making widgets accessible, we even got a test environment with Firefox 1.5. I’ve only had the time to scan through specification, so my view should be taken with a big pinch of salt, but my first impression is definitely positive. We’ll see how it develops after I had time to digest it and make a few tests.

    Every now and then, but especially when I build pages that combine index of images together with a preview of one of them, I wish there was a way to tell a browser to remember a part of a current page and apply it at appropriate place on the next one from the same domain which also has same ID.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The gist of a problem is that I sometimes want bookmark-ability of separate pages without throwing away a product of an expensive operation. I want my cake and eat it too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is impossible, since there’s no way to actually store DOM objects and I’m not even sure it’s a good idea. Nevertheless, I certainly do miss the feature.

    Building XHTML using DOM methods is annoying as it is without strange errors making things worse. Today I stumbled on a new problem when testing improved organizer in Internet Explorer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are creating INPUT elements with non-default types (that is other than text input), then you have to change their type BEFORE you attach them to document tree. Otherwise Explorer might complain.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I haven’t had time to test this  sufficiently and frankly I’d rather do something else on Sunday evening, so there might be some cases where above doesn’t hold true. But if you find yourself looking at such an error, it doesn’t hurt to try my remedy.

   &lt;p&gt;
    Ever since I listened to Andy Clarke’s talk at @media, I’ve been convinced that what we’re missing is a simple way to distinguish between visitors which need accessible version of the site and those who would prefer to use a non-accessible version.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still think that by and large sites should be made accessible to everyone and done so completely. But just as Braille signs are used only by those who need them, there’s no reason why everyone should be using the same user interface when not doing so can be beneficial.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Those who’ve been dabbling with Javascript and AJAX for a while have probably noticed that it can be very difficult if often not impossible to make every piece of interface accessible. A common approach was to add javascript as a layer on top of an accessible website, which could be turned off when necessary. I find this a rather blunt instrument, since all or nothing approach removes even pieces that may be useful and accessible. Yet, there didn’t seem to be a better way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Accessibility preference would ideally be provided by a browser in a way that can be picked up with Javascript (environment variable?), but lacking that, I was looking for a way to signal such preference through user defined CSS. My idea was to define a syntactically valid, but normally not used combination of a page element, CSS property and its value that could be interpreted as a switch for accessible version of the site.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, now
    &lt;a href="http://osflash.org/flashaid"&gt;
     there’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    another way to learn if screen reader is used (
    &lt;a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/77#comment-container"&gt;
     via
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Jeremy Keith), which uses Flash 8 and its JS-Flash bridge to read if such a device is present. Obviously its use is not universal, but it covers scenario that troubles me most.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still a real fix would be a better support from user agents. It doesn’t seem to be that hard to add an environment variable and a preference switch, so is there some other reason why it hasn’t happened yet?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

     friend
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of mine is having a lousy year. He broke a leg, but further complications have brought him back to the hospital. I wanted to lend him some DVD’s to shorten those long hours in bed, yet who has the time to transcribe all those titles?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, if you’re a Mac user, then there’s a program called
    &lt;a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/"&gt;
     Delicious Library
    &lt;/a&gt;
    which lets you (among other things) input those DVD’s by simply scanning the barcode with a camera. I have to say that calling that program awesome is an understatement. I simply can’t think of a better designed piece of software. It is as if every piece of the program, every line of code or UI ornament was specifically minted for your satisfaction. True craftsmanship.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I once heard that persian rugs were always created with one deliberate mistake, since only god was allowed true perfection. Well, there’s a mistake like that in Delicious Library. I tried to buy it for more than an hour, probably more like two, and it simply wouldn’t budge. You can’t buy it through a browser. You have to use its own interface which in my case simply refused to work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Finally I gave up and wrote a message about my tribulations that in hindsight could be more friendly. I’ve soon received a friendly message from Mike together with an evaluation license, which allowed me to produce the list.

    Now I only have to find a way to actually pay for it, since the product and people behind it more than deserve it.

    As mentioned in previous post, I think @media javascript panel deserves its own post and this large blob of text that follows is my take on it. You can also read
    &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2006/06/media_impressio.html"&gt;
     PPK’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    view or Paul Hammond’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/2006/06/atmedia2/javascript"&gt;
     transcription
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’ll be relying on them to augment my memory.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I started my programming career pretty far from web stack and it took me a while to accept that this is what I’m mostly doing. As I listened to the panelists, I was wondering if this may be the reason why I perceive things a bit differently, although I doubt it. Still, @media javascript panel raised some good questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Are Javascript libraries unnecessary?
     &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    It seems obvious that panelists would be disinclined to say yes, since they are the people who need them the least. I don’t use them yet either, but on the other hand I’m certain that they are needed and that I eventually will. Their proliferation is one of more obvious confirmations for this and even if some of them are pretty daft (especially
    &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/"&gt;
     those
    &lt;/a&gt;
    who try to twist Javascript to look and behave like some other language), it doesn’t follow that all of them are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t buy the argument that they obscure too much. I don’t see what would distinguish them from programming libraries used in other environments. You don’t use them if you don’t need to, but it also doesn’t make sense to develop a complex piece of code, if there’s an existing version out there, which was tested and debugged by many and is actively maintained.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you hit a bug in a library, you are left with same situation as otherwise. You can report a bug and wait for the fix or dive into code yourself and try to solve it. As with open source software you’re actually better off than you’d be if you worked with closed source.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nothing actually stops you from learning how the library works, if that’s what you want or need. It would be great if we all knew intrinsically what is happening on the computer and how the whole process of displaying a page works, but let’s face it, we don’t and there’s for all intents and purposes a huge black box underneath that sort of does what we want and we sort of understand why and how it does it. Using a well developed and documented library doesn’t change much.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also don’t buy
    &lt;a href="http://simon.incutio.com/"&gt;
     Simon Willison’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    argument that libraries should be obsolete and that browser should be enough. Libraries happened because browsers take too much time to develop and spread and I don’t see this changing any time soon. It would be nice, if parts of todays libraries were standardized in tomorrow’s browsers, but I’m sure innovative people out there will always find stuff they’d like to do which their current environment doesn’t let them. And when that stuff can be generalized, it should be put in a library.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     So what’s really wrong with libraries?
     &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    One problem is that many of them are quite large and it may take a while before they get downloaded. Even worse, downloaded versions don’t get shared when used by different websites, since they don’t come from the same network resource. However, as already said, I think circumventing this problem by simply using an installed version on some other servers (you can use Dojo installed on AOL’s server) is daft too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Computer networks are fairly fragile and in some parts of the world even more so. It’s not a rare event when at least parts of the world are inaccessible. Do you really want to bet your success on your visitors accessibility of some resource completely away from your control?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think caching is not a bad idea, but it needs support from browsers. The same problem could be solved by giving each library plus its version a unique fingerprint, which browsers could use to identify possible hits in their cache. The most nonhackish way of calling a script that I could come up with was:
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://some.server.on.the.net/coollib.js?jslibPrint=sdrt32svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    A different approach would be to simply include most popular Javascript libraries as a part of a browser installation. But this approach has at least two downsides. First, it would be limited to chosen few and second, which is one of my real objections to current crop of libraries out there, you’d need a fairly mature libraries.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One problem with current libraries which was pointed out is namespace collision. It is not a new problem and although some languages (Python, Java…) provide a mechanism to avoid it, others like C don’t. For me even more annoying is lack of stable APIs. It’s simply hard to rely on a library that changes interfaces too often.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But none of these problems is either new or insurmountable. I think libraries are here to stay and that’s a good thing. I prefer a web with plenty of well-done web sites than one with a handful of masterpieces swimming in a sea of crap.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And
    &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/"&gt;
     Stuart Langridge
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is right.
    &lt;a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/"&gt;

    Q: How can you tell that you’re at tech conference?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A: The line in front of men’s toilets is longer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/"&gt;

    has finished. It was great and I specially enjoyed presentations given by
    &lt;a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/"&gt;
     Nate Koechley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/"&gt;
     Andy Clarke
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Those two alone made going worthwhile and if you have a chance to see any of them, don’t miss the opportunity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The conference was much bigger this year, which is one thing I didn’t like. It was harder to find people you were looking for and even if you did find them, they were usually already occupied by somebody else. If you’re an introverted guy like me and not a natural orator, then it can be a bit difficult to make the most of the time you have. I didn’t, but I’m glad I finally met
    &lt;a href="http://www.clagnut.com/"&gt;
     Richard
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , who’s an even nicer guy in real life.

    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/"&gt;
      Eric Meyer
     &lt;/a&gt;
     talked about last 10 years of CSS. An interesting talk, but for me even more important, he explained to me why
     &lt;a href="css-margin-collapse.html"&gt;
      margin collapsing
     &lt;/a&gt;
     wasn’t a daft idea.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I went to a design panel with
     &lt;a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/"&gt;
      Jon Hicks
     &lt;/a&gt;
     ,
     &lt;a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php"&gt;
      Veerle Pieters
     &lt;/a&gt;
     and
     &lt;a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/"&gt;
      Cameron Moll
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , since I know a thing or two about Javascript, but I’m completely design illiterate, which this blog can only attest to. I can’t say how designers liked it, but it was certainly very educational for me. I knew I choose my colors as if I was colorblind, but I also discovered I need to learn more about grids.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/"&gt;
      Dave Shea
     &lt;/a&gt;
     gave a nice rundown of the state of web typography and pros and cons of different methods and Andy Budd entertainingly as always presented tricks and approaches to tackling browser bugs.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html"&gt;
      Jeffrey Veen
     &lt;/a&gt;
     talked about Web 2.0 and new applications and although he made quite a lot of good points, I’m not sure openness wins every time. My counter example would be instant messaging, where GTalk hasn’t changed the field much. I hope I’m wrong and this will change in the future.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Day two started with
     &lt;a href="http://www.simplebits.com/"&gt;
      Dan Cederholm’s
     &lt;/a&gt;
     interesting presentation, where I again learned a trick or two. I especially enjoyed the way to build scalable arrows using CSS.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Dan’s talk was followed with Javascript panel. Personally, I think the idea of centralized hosting of Javascript libraries to improve caching doesn’t make much sense. If nothing else you bet that your visitors will also be able to access your caching sites which might not always be true. It certainly isn’t in this part of the world, where partial break-downs are not all that uncommon. Still, the panel probably deserves its own post.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Cameron Moll also gave a presentation on the state of mobile web design. It wasn’t bad, but I hoped for more.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Nate Koechley’s talk was a revelation. An incredible amount of good information and it’s been eye opening for me to learn about Yahoo’s experience. Scary that they build an internet explorer emulating layer for Yahoo Mail though (why didn’t they just drop the original code and start over?).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I enjoyed last year’s session with Andy Clarke, so I decided to attend this years as well and I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve been a fan of Andy’s work for quite some time now and I’m definitely buying his book when it comes out. So should you.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is it. I hope to be there again next year.

    Today is this blog’s first anniversary. I posted my first post after I came back from last year’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia/"&gt;
     @media
    &lt;/a&gt;
    conference, which is where I’m going tomorrow. I’m sure it will be even better than last year, but I somehow don’t look forward to it. I got used to traveling with my wife and lost the lust for going solo.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In this year I wrote 176 posts (not including this one) or almost one every two days. A lot and certainly too many for them all to be worth reading. I hope at least some of them have been.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Reliable statistics are a bitch. I installed different packages at various times, each using their own approach to tracking, which produced lots of numbers of dubious quality. Still, for the interested few, this blog has been accessed by more than 12 thousand individuals at least 23 thousand times. Counting all visits including feed update checks, 116 thousand visits resulted in more than 264 thousand generated pages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Majority of visitors didn’t come from Slovenia (only 25.8%), so it was probably not a stupid idea to write this blog in English even if my countrymen read above average number of pages per visit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m completely humbled by the amount of time that was spent reading or scanning this blog, even if each visitor spent only a second on it. I hope it was worth it and that most of them don’t miss that second. I’m even more amazed that some of you liked it enough to subscribe to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since summaries like this are far more fun to write than to read, I’ll end this one and make it the last. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you again.

    I never got a hang of “release early, release often” policy. I’m sure it works nice in practice, but it simply feels wrong to bestow an application to public use that you know is faulty. It should be my job to suffer through its problems until I can’t find any.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still,
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/code/marelapys60.html" title="Link to download page"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    it is. First public version of a Marela uploader for series 60 phones written in Python.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It took longer then I thought, mainly because I overestimated my free time, but also because it grew new features. You can either shoot a new photo or choose an existing one, set its policy and tags and upload it to your Marela account. But whatever you do, you should treat it as you hopefully treat any first release. With utmost suspicion.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And you should do it in slovene, unless you change code, an easy enough task even if code is a bit messy. I didn’t try to support Flickr, but it shouldn’t be hard to do so for those (unlike me) with free time and without a conflict of interests.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Have fun.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I really dislike headaches and although I don’t get them as often as I used to, they are usually not as easy to shake of. That’s why we have several different pills in our home to battle this nuisance. I recently noticed that one of them, Plivadon, has its name stamped in Braille on the box (click for a bigger picture):
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="imageL" href="http://www.marela.si/photos/6581/?original" title="Full size picture"&gt;
     &lt;img alt="A box of Plivadon pill's" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/ndkvtPUIDCSxe-m9hlVPA8rI8xc.jpg"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    It’s great that
    &lt;a href="http://www.pliva.com/"&gt;
     Pliva
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (Plivadon’s maker) makes its product more accessible to blind people. At the same time, this is also a good example of how difficult good accessibility is.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a common misconception that all blind people either know how to read Braille or can learn how to. In fact, a large part if not majority of them don’t and can’t. The reason for this is that you can learn Braille only if tips of your fingers are sensitive enough and that’s usually the case only for those who were born blind or became blind in their youth.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But blindness can be caused by an accident later in life or by various diseases like diabetes, which means it’s far more common among older people, who through years of working with hands lost the necessary sensitivity in their fingers. They are in such cases forced to cope with their usual methods such as being very organized about where they put things.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Pliva (and other companies) could help them more. They could make the shape and size of the box more unique. They could stamp an easily recognizable pattern on parts of the box, just like they did with Braille. Anything that can make the tactile feedback more unique would probably help.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#pliva-2006-06-05"&gt;
      1
     &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a name="pliva1-2006-06-06"&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Alas they, as more often than not we, don’t do what they easily could.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div class="notes"&gt;

     Notes:

     &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a name="pliva-2006-06-05"&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      Braille sign on Plivadon’s box is distinguishing enough mark for as long as there isn’t a similarly sized box and a sign at the approximately same position.
      &lt;a href="#pliva1-2006-06-06"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Fry already

     described
    &lt;/a&gt;
    some of the graver errors. But his list is not nearly complete and here are some issues that bother me most:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     not only is Javascript often inlined, it’s also not degradable (crap like href=”javascript:void really has no place in modern web development)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divitis" title="Description of divitis"&gt;
      divitis
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     inline CSS
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     ridiculously long list of external resources (87 on main page), which result in excruciatingly long page loads on connections with high latency
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     poor contrast between text and background in large parts of a page can be an accessibility problem
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I could go on, but I don’t want to complain too much. As I’ve said before, this page is a clear improvement over the previous one and it’s also obvious from it that their creators do care about modern development and its often forgotten parts like accessibility.  This is exactly the reason why I decided to write about its failings and not about some other, more atrocious one.

     Zavod Embrio
    &lt;/a&gt;
    shows an ambition for good designs and although I don’t think they’re quite there yet, I’m sure they soon will be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And I guess my notion that there’s no need for workshops on XHTML, CSS and web standards in general has been proven wrong.

     keyboards

    or monitors in Slovenia. I hate it almost as much as buying clothes, although looking for decent clothes is usually less futile.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We need to replace a monitor, which developed an affection for pink, so we went out to find a replacement. A 19″ or larger LCD monitor with decent picture would do nicely. Surely a reasonable expectation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems you can get anything you want as long as what you want has a picture that is either misty, has shadow or has a glossy enough screen to see yourself clearly in it even when turned on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since nothing was worth buying, we bought nothing. I actually don’t mind that they mostly sell cheap crap, if that is what is selling. But it is hard to imagine that there are so few people looking for decent monitors not to warrant at least one or two decent models on display.

    I like Firefox extensions and use a few myself. Web development without
    &lt;a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/"&gt;
     Web Developer toolbar
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/"&gt;
     LiveHTTPHeaders
    &lt;/a&gt;
    extension would be pretty gruesome. However, there’s a downside to their use that is slowly starting to bother me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They often influence the way Javascript on page gets executed and can produce weird errors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I first noticed this while using Web Developer toolbar. Every now and then I got a strange exception, but I didn’t worry too much. After all, it wasn’t really surprising coming from an extension that by its very nature dabbled with the way browser interprets and displays a page and it didn’t really stop the script from working. Not pretty, but you learn to live with it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Comes this weekend and I get a report that file upload doesn’t work in latest Firefox. I suspected extension conflicts and further examination proved the point. Page worked just fine in the same environment sans extensions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what can you do, when you stumble on a problem like that?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Testing your site in various browsers can be troublesome enough. Testing all combinations of extensions even for one browser would simply be impossible. You can’t exactly expect your users to uninstall their extensions just for you, but making workarounds for them doesn’t seem feasible either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So far I don’t see a good solution. Any ideas?

    I thought it would be nice to give a quick update on status of my Marela uploader for series 60 mobile phones. I have a working version, which is about two annoying bugs and a missing installer away from first release.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    My prognosis of a good day or so development left has so far been correct. I’ve spent a bit more than a day working on it since then and I don’t see bigger obstacles in front of me. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m also quite satisfied with its speed. There are few rough edges where API is lacking, but in general it’s fast enough and not visibly slower than your average mobile Java application.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll be busy with work for next couple of days, so I expect to release it (together with source) somewhere in the middle of next week. And Python for series 60 phones definitely rules.

    A Marela member notified us, that file upload doesn’t work in
    &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/"&gt;
     Opera Mini
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s true, because Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads which you can easily check by visiting two
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/inputfile/index.html"&gt;
     demo pages
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with valid XHTML. You shouldn’t see a file input element on either of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe (but as an outsider obviously can’t prove) it lacks upload support for security reasons. Every web request handled by Opera Mini gets transported over a proxy, which fetches the page in questions and translates it in a compressed format suitable for viewing on small screen devices. This means that file uploads would be sent to proxy as well which depending on what is sent can be seen as a security violation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course it does allow logging in websites, a potentially unsafe action, which puts my speculation on shaky grounds. But the true point of this article still stands. Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads.

I’m left with few excuses from finishing my uploader and provided that other obligations don’t tax me too much, it should be finished in next week or so.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’ve stumbled on two small problems. I’d like to automatically tag images with phone model on which they were taken, but I don’t know how to read it. Is this possible at all?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other problem seems to be a limitation of PyS60 API or its documentation. You are limited to use of text as tab titles, which are too small for this to be useful. That’s why you see developers displaying tab title in place of application title. Is there a workaround for this?

    Cheaper than (outrageously) expensive is not necessarily cheap, it might be just less expensive. Personally, if people were screaming at me that 425 quid is too much as much as they do at Sony lately, I’d rather worry if 600 pounds price will simply be a disaster.

    I’ve been working on Marela uploader for series60 phones (those with Python support) and have had a great fun discovering the world of user interfaces on mobile devices.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you think there’s not enough space on your average web page, you really should try designing an interface for a device with stamp size screen with a resolution of
    &lt;a href="http://www.c64.com/"&gt;
     Commodore 64
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in full color mode (but luckily with far more colors) and input device that only kids could love. On top of that there’s a limited selection of existing UI controls to chose from and text can’t be too small to remain legible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I think the major problems have been solved and I’m maybe a day or so of development and a decent camera phone away from first working version. I’m hoping to get it done by this weekend, but realist in me keeps screaming: “Maybe next week!”

   &lt;p&gt;
    At least one participant of our recent
    &lt;a href="ajax-workshop-2.html" title="Previous announcement of AJAX workshop"&gt;
     workshop
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was under impression that I’m an AJAX advocate. It’s certainly a reasonable and not completely wrong conclusion. However, it seems I failed in limited time available to explain my perspective.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As any other useful tool AJAX has its advantages, but it can also create problems when used inappropriately. I won’t dwell on advantages. More than enough has already been said about them. There are three important aspects that still don’t get enough attention and bear repeating.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Write unobtrusive and degradable Javascript.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    It’s really not that hard with a bit of planning and it makes things easier in the long run. It’s easier to find, fix and change code when it’s cleanly separated from HTML and CSS. I’d expect everyone learned this lesson by now from PHP. Also, creating HTML version first and then carefully improving it with use of Javascript/AJAX can get us maximum reach without sacrificing flexibility.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Pay attention to usability.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    This one is much harder to get right, but if nothing else, you should have in mind at least next three advices. Show a progress indicator when doing something that might take more than a second. Put action trigger as close as possible to the part of a page it will change, so user has a good chance of noticing it and whenever possible assist them with change indicators like
    &lt;a href="http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7" title="Example of yellow fade-in"&gt;
     yellow fade-in
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Accessibility shouldn’t be forgotten either.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    This is probably
    &lt;a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/64" title="Accessibility problems with DOM manipulation"&gt;
     the hardest problem
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to tackle. It’s the most important reason (but not the only one) why I try to use Javascript/AJAX only when benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the problems it might cause.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Everyone makes mistakes and I certainly have. I’m sure they weren’t last ones either, but we can all strive for better.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A few days ago I read about
    &lt;a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/"&gt;
     IndieKarma
    &lt;/a&gt;
    on Jason Kottke’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/05/indiekarma-micropayments"&gt;
     blog
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I agree with most of his remarks and I have a couple of my own.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I dislike the fact that IndieKarma is another walled garden. It means that both the content publisher and visitor must use the same system for transaction to occur and that’s a lot to ask. Building a more open system, which would allow transactions between parties belonging to different systems and wouldn’t be prone to abuse, is difficult and is probably one of the reasons why it hasn’t happened yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But I think it’s also a necessity for small companies like
    &lt;a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/About.xhtml"&gt;
     PixelPass
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , since as a visitor I’m unlikely to use more than a couple of such systems. Same goes for me as a publisher. If my reach is limited to websites using same service as me, then they’ll have a hard time getting traction. It will also be impossible to compete with big boys if they decide to move in this space.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    IndieKarma is also a very apt name for a service that by its very nature is completely voluntary. Even if it was widely used on websites, it wouldn’t amount to much without people willing to spend money when they don’t have to. I’m sure there are lots of well-intentioned folks out there, but the enormous prevalence of ad supported services and the fact that most users
    &lt;a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/will-your-web-app-make-money"&gt;
     will be freeloaders
    &lt;/a&gt;
    makes me doubtful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, it’s a nice idea with approach that might work. I certainly hope it does.

    In true Don Quixote fashion, I made a new attempt to make email harvesting more difficult. It won’t work forever, but it will work longer than
    &lt;a href="hide-email-address-from-spammers-with-javascript.html"&gt;
     previous
    &lt;/a&gt;
    one, which hasn’t fail yet either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This time I use a bit different approach. Instead of replacing spam-proof, but not directly usable email addresses with mail links on page load, I create mail links on page load, but populate them when mouse moves over them. This way they are still perfectly usable, but less likely to be abused. They are also less friendly, since you can’t see email address until you move your pointer over it. But that was the point, to prevent javascript enabled scrappers.

    and I were sunbathing at a nearby cafe, sipping juice and talking as we often do about Python related things.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I noted how I’d hate to see
    &lt;a href="http://www.effbot.org/"&gt;
     Fredrik Lundh
    &lt;/a&gt;
    being swallowed by the black hole of Google, where too often good people go to never hear from them again. I simply can’t seem to write anything substantial in Python these days without relying on at least a piece of Fredrik’s code.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sebastjan doesn’t share my pessimism and he might be right. Forgetting my possibly unsubstantiated fears for a moment, which Pythonista’s loss would in your opinion hurt our beloved language the most?

    Sometimes I’m really glad my brains don’t let my mouth shoot off as quickly as it would like.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was checking latest versions of
    &lt;a href="http://prototype.conio.net/"&gt;
     Prototype
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/"&gt;
     Dojo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://www.mochikit.com/"&gt;
     MochiKit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a couple of days ago and while I liked the first two, I had a much lower opinion of the third. In fact, I couldn’t understand why
    &lt;a href="http://www.turbogears.org/"&gt;
     Turbogears
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has chosen MochiKit as its AJAX library and was about to write a post questioning just that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m glad I didn’t. MochiKit still wouldn’t be my choice and probably won’t be when I’ll start using existing libraries instead of mine, but that doesn’t make it a bad choice. A lot of thought and effort has been put into its implementation and it shows.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are obviously things I dislike about it and the major one being the way it loads dependencies. I despise document.write and I disagree with argument made in comments (Safari’s use of defer on generated scripts). But I guess this is something reasonable minds can disagree on.

     This
    &lt;/a&gt;
    brought a sad smile to my face.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There was a time when Javascript implementation in Internet Explorer was really top notch and other browsers had something to look up to (apart from memory leaking, which is just embarrassing). But it’s been 5 years since last IE and it will take almost another year to release version 7, which won’t bring any Javascript related changes (apart from native XMLHTTPRequest). I see myself as language minimalist, but
    &lt;a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/09/09/23.05.56/"&gt;
     there are
    &lt;/a&gt;
    things that I’d love to see implemented.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, IE is not the only thing developed with glacial speeds. Even though there’s talk of CSS3, we only received (another?) working draft of CSS 2.1 a couple of weeks ago. So, as many are not aware, even CSS 2.1 hasn’t seen a final release yet even though it’s been widely used for a while now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Slow development pace does have certain benefits. We get more time to learn and master new stuff and what we learned doesn’t age as quickly as it would otherwise. But when limits of what you have rub you the wrong way, it can be quite depressing to calculate how long it will take to remedy this. Especially if you’re bound not only to development of a technology, but also to its deployment. Thank &amp;lt;some deity&amp;gt; this is not an issue for me with Python 2.5.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the line of work that I do, I can pretty much forget anything in development which needs browser support, since it won’t be deployed widely enough in this decade. I don’t, since I’m a geek, but I could as there’s little I can do with it and there’s a whole history of great promises that didn’t make it in the end.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It does, however, pose an interesting question without an answer. When should I start learning something new?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    First part of AJAX workshop is behind me and I enjoyed it immensely. I hope our participants did as well or failing that, I hope we didn’t waste their time too much.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looking back I’m not satisfied with everything we did and I wish I’ve done my part better. I’m sure I wasn’t clear or coherent enough. Fry did much better, but I feel we could do better with examples.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we ever repeat this workshop, and we both would love to, we’ll have to make it longer, since there simply wasn’t enough time to talk about the details and quirks that can and usually do waste majority of your time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you were there yesterday, then please drop me a line or two about your experience. I’d also love to hear what you want from second part of the workshop, since it’s not too late to change it to suit you better.

    I tried to leave a comment on
    &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com/"&gt;
     Digg
    &lt;/a&gt;
    recently and had trouble deciphering its
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"&gt;
     CAPTCHA
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I was eventually successful, but only after I got annoyed. Simply put, CAPTCHAs are evil.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s no need to rehash why, since
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+accessibility"&gt;
     plenty
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has been said so far. They
    &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/"&gt;
     don’t
    &lt;/a&gt;
    really work and they
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Accessibility"&gt;
     exclude
    &lt;/a&gt;
    lots of people even if you do use an alternative audio check. As a left-handed person, who curses every time he picks up an “ergonomically” designed scissors, I kind of imagine how it is when things are designed for a majority you don’t belong to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, even if you could make them completely accessible (doubtful) and would somehow be able to resolve the overlap between smartest programs and, well, less-gifted humans (impossible), I’d still dislike them. What they say to your readers is: “I’ll make you work so I don’t have to.”

    Another piece of chicken fillet went into the trash bin, because I didn’t check its expiration date when I bought it a few days ago and hence didn’t see it expired on the same day.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Would it be really that hard to clearly label food that is going to expire in a couple of days?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    As a customer I’d appreciate this greatly as it would allow me to plan a little bit better by when to use what. Either no one has thought of something so obvious or

    A colleague of mine told me a story couple of days ago, how he sat up a linux box for a friend so he could watch movies on his TV. By itself nothing surprising, since I’m sure we all know plenty of people who do just this or something very similar.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, what did surprise me was the user interface my colleague built (as requested) for his friend. It has two buttons. First one starts playing first movie on the alphabetically ordered list. Second one deletes the first movie on the list.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s as simple as it could possibly get, but it forces you to adapt your behavior to it. Mind you that’s true for all interfaces, it’s just that this one makes it more obvious. Like in cinema you have to see the movie in one go or start from beginning and watch parts already seen. To see movie down the list you either need to see all before or chose not to see them at all. In a way, I’d say it’s an interface of a true movie buff. You watch all movies and when you do, you do it without compromising.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find it highly fascinating even though I don’t know why. Is it the strange interface, the fact that someone wanted it or something else? I’m not sure. I’m intrigued at how easy it has become to build your own interface and I’m sure it will get even easier. Yet this is not what fascinates me. But for some reason I just can’t get his story out of my head.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I knew it exists, but I haven’t looked into
    &lt;a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/python"&gt;
     Python on series 60
    &lt;/a&gt;
    until yesterday and I wish I did so sooner. My mind is just flooded with ideas of what to do and I can easily see myself wasting lots of time playing with it. I do wish it was possible to build stand-alone applications, which wouldn’t require a separate installation of Python. As such I believe series 60 Python is more or less limited to prototyping and personal use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s one thing that is a problem for an old goat like me (over 30 and loving it). It’s a pain in the ass to type anything substantial on mobile phone and although some new phones (like Nokia N70) have predictive dictionary for my language, lots of them including mine don’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do have an idea on how to tackle this problem. Most of us have a vocabulary of few thousand words (unlike Shakespeare, who I’m told used 36 thousand of them), but we only use few hundred of them in our everyday life. Therefore if my text input heavy applications would continuously build a dictionary of words typed by user, they would fairly soon get a usable predictive dictionary for this particular user.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are downsides. You start with nothing and there’s a problem of how to build  a dictionary without annoying. You could tackle this by staying in learn-only mode until your dictionary-hit ratio rises above some threshold (80-90%?).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are also pluses. You get a dictionary that’s much better fitted to your user than a generic one, since it actually has words he uses. That is if I’m not underestimating dictionaries used in modern mobiles.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What would make it even better is if such dictionary would be standardized so any application could use it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update: I was wrong, you
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.mobilenin.com/pys60/info_standalone_application.htm"&gt;
      can
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional
    &lt;a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/"&gt;
     CSS Reboot
    &lt;/a&gt;
    day. I find the idea at least odd, if not exactly wrong, so this blog won’t be one of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As can be clearly seen, I’m not a graphic designer. Even though I’m certain my current design is better than previous was, it’s not exactly good either. There’s also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability. Then again, it’s not my intention to discuss a particular design as much as graphic design use and its role in general.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year. It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence. This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same mold?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or where it’s the story itself. But more often than not it’s something that not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting value. I wish I was like
    &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/"&gt;
     Jon Udell
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published, but I’m not.  What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one coherent whole and it’s vexing that design by its singularity implies that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they should know better only implies values I don’t share, but certainly doesn’t enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern widely used content management systems which as all software embodies values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often rather ignorant users .

     We’re preparing a workshop at Spletne urice (???Web hours??? in Slovenian, a weekly meeting of web enthusiasts) that will focus on AJAX, hosted by me and another Marko. Actually we’re preparing two of them. The first one will cover the basics of asynchronous transport and data, the second one will add some DOM scripting and review some AJAX frameworks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    Being the other Marko I can say this workshop will totally rock. It has to, because AJAX is cool, right? Instant fame, riches and all that.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Seriously though, I do believe it will be a great experience for those who’ll attend. Everyone is welcome, but only first 10, sorry, 9

    will get this chance because of limits imposed on us by the choice of venue. It’s even free (not likely to happen again any time soon), so price can be hardly something to worry about.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    You can also help us make it better for you by contributing websites you’d like to see getting a makeover and telling us as much as you can about what you’d like to hear there (and what not).

    that email hiding technique I use won’t work anymore. However I still think it would be a great idea if I could remove a part of a page from search index, even if it won’t help me hide from spammers in the long run.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I’d really like is to specify which parts of a page are not its content and can be safely ignored by search engines. Ignoring it would also mean absence of those parts from search indexes. Spiders could still follow links inside those parts, because I can still use
    &lt;em&gt;
     robots.txt
    &lt;/em&gt;
    file if I really want to block their traversal. In effect, I’d like a more fine-grained approach to blocking, which doesn’t force the layout of my pages to even slightly favor spiders over people.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The way I imagine it would work is by simply applying a class name to the parts of the page I’d want shielded. I don’t care much (yet) if such class name would need to be specified in robots file or if it would be some name achieved by a web consensus. As far as I can see both approaches would work equally well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The benefit of this would also be better search results. Every now and then I follow a search hit that fit my query because of a combination of site content and its navigation. Judging by my logs I’m not the only deceived soul. So, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to tell which parts are content and which aren’t?

   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not sure how I missed the original announcement of Simple List Extensions (SLE) for feeds, but better late than never.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    SLE is a very simple specification to extend feeds syntax to better support some common scenarios that weren’t covered with original specifications of RSS and Atom. Previously there was no way to tell feed readers/aggregators to display feed items in fixed order (e.g. feed with most popular stories of the day) or delete items not present in feed anymore (e.g. auction site feed with items matching a query).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    SLE also adds support for grouping and filtering of feed items, which might not be very useful with you average 10-item feed, but will be, if feeds will indeed become a general mechanism for transporting data and not only a tool to highlight most recent bunch of updates. In any case, you can read a very short
    &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sle/"&gt;
     specification
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or visit
    &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/30/565222.aspx"&gt;
     latest announcement
    &lt;/a&gt;
    which includes more explanatory links to why and how they can and already are used.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By the way, I’m not sure if any reader apart from beta of IE7 already supports SLE, but I expect that most of them will soon. There’s little reason not to.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One of more popular javascript scripts I’ve written is a simple function that hides an email address from spiders by constructing a mailto link on page load. So far it has worked quite well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lately I started to have my doubts about this approach though. There was
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=mozilla+google+spider&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;
     a series of articles
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a while ago about Google’s new Mozilla-based spider that I didn’t take too seriously at the time. However, even if not true then, it’s still only a matter of time before a spider like this will show up. The new found popularity of AJAX/Javascript simply guarantees that, since search engines can’t and won’t give up indexing content hidden behind fancy scripts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Which means that my script will stop working in not so distant future as will all email obfuscating scripts out there. If it can be seen by a human, then it will be seen by a spider. So is there a way to publish my email address without it becoming public through search engines indexes, which is where most spammers seem to get our emails?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I could write a robots.txt file, which would exempt my contact page from being indexed at all. But this is a rather crude approach, since it means nothing on that page will get indexed. I could move email information to a separate page to let other contact data get indexed, but this is hardly any nicer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I’d really want is to be able to tell to search engines that only a part of my document is off limits. I don’t think there’s currently a way to do this, but if anyone has an idea how to do it, I’d really like to hear it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    I think all efforts, including mine, to prevent spammers from collecting published addresses are ultimately doomed. The basic premise of all such approaches is to cloak an address in a way that spider can’t see it or can’t recognize it if it does. By basing spider on something like Mozilla, there won’t be any difference between what spider sees and what user does. There’s a similar problem with recognition. As spiders gets smarter, as they invariably do, you’ll be getting ever growing overlap between smartest spiders and stupidest users until it’s big enough to be unacceptable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So we’ll either put up contact forms or I hope move to defending our inboxes with smart spam filters (those who haven’t yet).
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I recently noticed a changing behavior in how my family and friends go about buying a new mobile phone. The reason they have a mobile is to receive and make phone calls, but their selection of a model to buy is based mostly on secondary functions like built-in camera.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In itself this isn’t surprising. It’s normal and common that when features become ubiquitous, competition and differentiation moves elsewhere. Basic functionality of phones has certainly been fulfilled and it’s difficult to add a new call-related feature that would be a significant progress.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But what I find utterly fascinating is something else. Even though primary functions play no part in selection of a phone, they are still the main if not the only reason why we have them. In fact, they are what we use most and we wouldn’t buy phones otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So here’s an interesting dichotomy. Which phone is bought and when has nothing to do with why we have it or little to do with how we use it. We think we’re buying a phone and we’ll use it as a phone most of the time, but it’s features like camera or wifi that actually make a sale.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about it for a couple of days and I can’t think of any other product or service, where buyers would display the same behavior, but I have no doubt that this is only due my lack of imagination.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    This blog and other content of less dubious nature were inaccessible in last three days. A freak, previously unseen and therefore unforeseen scenario happened where two disks forming RAID-1, which haven’t shown a single sign of a problem, suddenly died simultaneously. As has been noted, a million to one chance scenarios crop up 9 times out of 10, so firm steps have been taken to prevent something like this from occurring ever again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve also rediscovered how I detest system administration and I’m happy to have competent friends to absolve me from it. I used to earn a part of my salary doing such work, which reminds me a lot of the war. Prolonged periods of preparations and shear boredom are pierced with short episodes full of adrenaline and occasionally terror of a fuck-up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another lesson form another unexpected discovery. I missed my blog as much as I did my email. A sad discovery indeed, showing I don’t prefer listening over talking as much as I should. However, there’s a silver lining in knowing that I haven’t longed for either too much.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is it. Everything should be back to normal, but if you find a dead link or something not working quite as it should, I’d appreciate a line or two describing the problem.

    Does anybody have problems with sgmllib.py?

    After I spent way too much time hunting a bug in my code, I gave up, read the
    &lt;em&gt;

    &lt;/em&gt;
    function in
    &lt;em&gt;
     sgmllib.py
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and I’m certain now that its parser is broken.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s say you’re handling a web page with inline Javascript code which also includes HTML tags. Even if you use a
    &lt;em&gt;
     setliteral
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method to skip processing data inside
    &lt;em&gt;
     &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    tags,
    &lt;em&gt;
     sgmllib.py
    &lt;/em&gt;
    will start doing so when it encounters first &amp;lt;/. It interprets this as a start of an end tag and tries  to close it. Even though code handles cases of known and unknown tags, it fails to do the right thing because it simply doesn’t expect a scenario where this isn’t a tag at all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other possibility is that I’m simply a dolt who should do stuff like this only when rested. By the way, where’s the proper place to make an ass out of myself complaining about standard library?

    But we get spam that drives me nuts, because it’s something that could be permanently fixed. You see, ALL of our trackback spam is directed to the same blog post. So, if I could turn trackback off only on that post, it would cut our spam to more than a half and leave my nerves intact.

    There’s an issue I’ve been struggling with for months now. Well, more than a year really. We built Marela so it would be used in Slovenia by people preferring Slovene language over the others. It’s not the only distinguishing point from similar services found on the web, but it’s an important one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, Internet and low fares airlines certainly shrank our planet and it’s not uncommon for many of us to have friends who don’t speak our language but with whom we’d still like to share parts of our lives and our creations. And this is a problem for Marela, which was (also) built to fill this need of sharing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s simply not possible to use Marela in any language but Slovene.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We decided to do this to avoid Orkut syndrome, where brazilian users (legitimately) subverted  a global service into a mostly Portuguese speaking one. We didn’t want to risk making our site unfriendly to Slovene-only speaking members by creating an environment in which a large portion of our community neither could or would speak Slovene.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe our interfaces are mostly self-explanatory and easy to use, but it’s difficult to tell how challenging they are for those who don’t speak their language. Judging by personal experience in using a dutch Windows 95 years ago, I’d say they are probably not easy enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, what can be done?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There was an idea to enforce Slovene only for logged in users, but this can work only as long as unregistered users are not allowed to contribute and the idea itself doesn’t feel natural to me. It seems such an artificial restriction and that never amounts to a good thing. And that was one of more promising ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I ran out of my own ideas long time ago. Any ideas you might have are therefore more than welcome.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s a vast number of potential Marela features that we are able, but not willing to implement, since they are detrimental to our design goals. There are also many, which we are willing and will implement, but it doesn’t change the fact that there will always be parts where we won’t compromise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, even though it seems natural that benefits to many should be more important than benefits to few, I never got quite comfortable with this. That’s why we also want to make Marela as open as possible to let our members customize it without affecting other people.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First, there are public APIs. They tend to work well for building new tools or interfaces, but offer little help in customizing existing ones. Which is what our users want most of the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Every modern browser lets users define a custom style sheet to change the presentation of websites. That’s why we recently added ID to body element, which lets users more
    &lt;a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/13291"&gt;
     easily customize
    &lt;/a&gt;
    the look of Marela alone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then there are tools like
    &lt;a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/"&gt;
     Greasemonkey
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which let proficient users using Mozilla based browsers customizing existing interfaces. Greasemonkey works quite well, if you’re proficient in Javascript.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think the biggest problem with Greasemonkey (and custom CSS for that matter) is that it’s tied to a browser and a computer. If you change either of them, your customization won’t work anymore without significant effort on your part. Sometimes, in restricted environments, it’s not even possible to make it work. It’s a bit easier to make and transfer CSS customizations, but you’re still forced to carry your file around.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not too bothered with CSS. I simply don’t see much need for it beyond what Marela’s design and modern browsers already offer and I’m still biased against skin-deep themes offered by some programs. In any case a possible solution for it would be practically the same as what I have in mind for a case that does trouble me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Idea is pretty simple. Define javascript hooks that get called after window.onload event when they exist. If there’s an easy way to add your javascript file to a page (say, by uploading it to our server), then you can create a simple, but cross-browser and cross-computer Greasemonkey.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Question that remains is, is this appealing enough for you to use it?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Few months ago, while exporting vCards from Apple’s Address Book (which uses UTF-16 instead of to me more common UTF-8), I discovered that there’s really no general agreement on which encoding should be used for storing vCards. It was quite a disheartening discovery, since you can’t get this information from a filesystem and it’s difficult to transform encoding to a uniform one, if you don’t know the encoding of the source.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I decided to tackle this problem once other problems were solved and I’m happy to say my procrastination payed off. Mark Pilgrim wrote another excellent
    &lt;a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/" title="Universal Encoding Detector"&gt;
     module
    &lt;/a&gt;
    which solves my problem better than I ever could.

    Universal Encoding Detector is a python port of code used by Mozilla to accomplish the same thing and is really very simple to use. Obviously it can’t be perfect since it’s not possible detect encoding completely reliably. But it works quite well and if you need such functionality, you should really give it a try.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I haven’t and I don’t know anyone who did. It’s also hard to imagine being otherwise if designs are done without taking existing XHTML into account. There’s always an element missing for attaching a part of your design to, unless XHTML was somewhat loose to begin with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t think this is a problem. There are plenty of real benefits to table-less designs and few, if any deficiencies. However, I do believe that this benefit, touted by many including me, is contrived.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or am I just wrong? What’s your experience?

    &lt;a href="http://web.zen.si/archives/2005/10/spletne-urice-2-mikroformati/"&gt;
     a talk
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about microformats last October and some people back then were doubtful about their usefulness. Yesterday I read
    &lt;a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/Blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry"&gt;
     a post
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Ray Ozzie on the need for web clipboards and accompanying formats and my immediate thought was that microformats were perfect for this use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Ray Ozzie talks about a need for easy interoperability and exchange of data between web sites and I believe most if not all of us who are working towards this goal agree that feeds (RSS or whatever) by themselves are not enough. Web clipboards seem to be a big step in right direction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The post itself has since been updated with more information and a
    &lt;a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html"&gt;
     great demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    how microformats could be used as a clipboard format for greater interoperability between different web services. You should check it out even if you don’t have doubts about the need for microformats.

    If you’re sitting in the wrong part of the world, then Google might be inaccessible to you right now. That would be only a minor annoyance, if the same wasn’t true also for Google Analytics.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s remarkable how many sites (including this one) use it and are right now more or less inaccessible to every poor soul suffering from Google blackout. That’s because browser can’t tell if external Javascript will use a method like
    &lt;em&gt;
     document.write
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and therefore blocks rendering until the code is loaded or it timeouts waiting for it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There should be a workaround for times like this and according to HTML4 specification there is
    &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/scripts.html#adef-defer"&gt;
     one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . By using
    &lt;em&gt;
     defer=”defer”
    &lt;/em&gt;
    we can signal to the browser that it can safely proceed rendering the page, because we won’t be using any dangerous methods in our Javascript files.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, it sadly doesn’t work everywhere. It works in Internet Explorer, but fails in Firefox and Safari. And that simply sucks.

    This week I had an interesting discussion with Ratnadeep Bhattacharjee about my
    &lt;a href="news-at-seven-javascript-i18n-that-almost-doesnt-suck.html" title="Older post with js i18n library"&gt;
     previous try
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to solve javascript i18n needs and it quickly become obvious that my library is not sufficient and likely also wrong approach to the problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are at least two unresolved issues with my current javascript i18n library:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     It doesn’t detect browser language settings and act accordingly.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     It’s one way only. After you changed the language used, you can’t change it again easily.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m sure these are not the only two problems, since I have a vague uneasiness about a few more things. Therefore I’d love to hear more thoughts about what you’d expect and need from such a library, before I continue down the possibly wrong path.

    &lt;a href="http://pages.google.com" title="Link to pages application"&gt;
     Nice idea
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but very poor execution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    It seems access to Google Page Creator is limited, so it would make sense if I spend some time explaining what I meant. What Google Page Creator (GPC) allows you to do, is to build a simple website using your browser. It differentiates itself from majority of such tools (but not all of them) in that it allows you to do this through a WYSIWYG interface, where you can easily see exactly how your page will look like when you’re finished with it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are things I like. Page creator is easy to use and you get a direct feedback on everything you do. Sadly, the overall impression is less positive, since there’s plenty I dislike:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     GPC is incredibly slow. True, G4 Powerbook is not a top of the line anymore, but there are tons of web applications with similar capabilities (some of them mine) which don’t drag their feet so much.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     As others have noted, HTML produced is simply crap. Font tags should be extinct by now and there’s really no excuse to produce them in 2006. You can get a glimpse of the horror by looking at the source of my page (linked at the end of this post).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     There are plenty of designs, but they mostly differ in color schemes used. It’s hard to find one that isn’t simply dull.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     GPC is simplified almost to the point of uselessness. You can stitch static pages together and build a simple static website, but there’s not much else you can do. I expected more. Something, anything that would make you believe the final result was done in the age of blogs, wikis and mash-ups and not 5-6 years ago.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short, it’s hardly an improvement over what was already available out there. You can see

     Things I wouldn’t do:
     &lt;br/&gt;
     Put up with any significant-whitespace whining. Here 99% of the Python community is with me. I think there is a meme that Python people are close-minded to suggestions for changes in the language. I think there is significant truth to that. But sometimes everyone else is just completely wrong. I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent their code. If you want to mis-indent your code you are an idiot. If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being absurd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Precisely. Yesterday was our regular
    &lt;a href="http://web.zen.si/"&gt;
     web talk evening
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is often followed by a lively debate. As usual we covered all sorts of topics, one of which was Python. To paraphrase a part of it:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     A: I don’t like Python because of significant whitespace.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     B: Do you indent your code?
     &lt;br/&gt;
     A: Yes, of course.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     B: And the problem is?
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t understand how this complaint doesn’t die. I can understand that some other language can tickle their fancy. People have different tastes and if some people like it rough, who am I to judge. But why in the world would you wish for a feature you’d never be stupid enough to use?

    What are possible reasons for a class of products to go the way of the

     Dodo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can think of two. The one I usually hear about is development of a new class of products that make old ones redundant. Popular examples being ice or whip making industries. I don’t need ice and when I do, my fridge is there for me and I rarely feel the urge to whip our car.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other one I can think of is a change of behavior as a consequence of a different price point.
    &lt;a href="http://www.burdamode.com/"&gt;
     Burda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    used to be popular, but I can’t think of anyone who’d still buy it. Price of clothes and shoes have become so low that most people prefer buying a replacement than repairing the old one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have flatfeet and highly value comfortable footwear. Disappearing shoemakers are a real problem for me so if anyone can recommend one in Ljubljana or Maribor, it would be greatly appreciated.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I caught an interesting
    &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/02/web_apps_single_point_of_subpo.html"&gt;
     observation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    on O’Reilly’s Radar. In my opinion there are two problems that web users should pay attention to. One, as noted on Radar, is privacy and the other is reliability of your service provider.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are limits to what we can do about either of them as a company. We built Marela on a fault-tolerant system using solid hardware and think user’s data is reasonably safe from data loss and intrusions. Like others we can’t rule it out completely, but I think it was worth it to build a safer system than our competition even if users often don’t care (until it’s too late).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We also don’t collect any personal data we don’t actually need and don’t store what we do collect a minute longer than absolutely necessary. However, there’s little we can do about our legal obligations. Even though legislation in Slovenia is not quite the same as the one cited in the article, it’s still true that it’s easier for law-enforcement institutions to legally access your data (unknown to you) if it’s not residing on your personal computer. We are eating our own dog food, so this doesn’t make us happy either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still think it’s dumb to have all your data stored only on your personal computer, especially since vast majority of computer users seldom if ever make backups. Encryption can go a long way in protecting data from prying eyes, but what I wish most is simply for people to be more aware.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Without awareness there’s little hope for improving the legislation and practices of our industry.

   &lt;p&gt;
    The pixel debate
    &lt;a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200602/setting_font_size_in_pixels/" title="Setting font size in pixels"&gt;
     is back
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Internet explorer out of the box doesn’t permit resizing text measured in pixels, which at the same time is the only reliable way of setting dimensions that produces same result everywhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The crux of the matter is simply who should have the final word in how the page is displayed, designers or users?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally I think it should be users. After all, it’s about them and if there’s a way for them to make their experience more pleasant or useful without degrading it for others, why shouldn’t they be allowed to do so? Good designs serve, not command.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I find it more interesting how many people have no idea what px unit actually
    &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units" title="Definitions of relative length units"&gt;
     means
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Pixels, as defined by W3C, are not the same as pixels used to define graphic resolution of a computer, even if they usually seem to be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For example, if we ever happen to get high-density monitors with say 300 dpi pixel density instead of these days common 96 dpi, then a 15″ display would have a graphic resolution of 3600×2700 dots, but it would still have only 1152×864 pixels in CSS model. Therefore one web pixel would be represented with around 9 graphic pixels.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, that’s the theory. In practice there’s a lot of cheating. Monitors have various sizes which are only an approximation of the stated one (15″, 17″ etc.). Operating systems try to pay attention to pixel density, but often don’t or can’t. And so on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The result of this is that size of displayed text and images is device dependent even when in theory it shouldn’t be. So the only way is also good only up to a point.

    Yesterday I talked about influence of language and tag design on ratio between the number of unique and all tags. I haven’t discussed why this number would be interesting and what would it tell us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s start with a simple graph:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Tag space" class="image" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/tag-graph.jpg"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Blue circles represent objects. Connections represent tags and rectangulars are pages with hits for a specific unique tag. As we can see, all images but one have two tags (number of connections from a circle) and the most popular tag is attached to 4 images (number of connections from a rectangular).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What ratio tells us is an average frequency of a given tag (how many connections does a typical rectangular have). The higher it is, more hits will be returned by search.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, tag connections and rectangulars also form a path between objects. Therefore higher ratio also means a better connected graph with (again on average) shorter paths between different objects. For example if we look at the red path on example graph then left top object is at least two clicks away from the top one and at least four clicks away from the bottom right one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If tag browsing and searching are main methods of exploration, then a loner like the most right circle is practically unreachable and more tags an object has, the better chances it has to be discovered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now, I presented a very simplified graph with a fairly even distribution of tags. Normally you wouldn’t have this. A word like cat is far more likely to be used as a tag than something like hippopotamus resulting in creation of super-nodes with far more connections to objects than system’s tag frequency ratio.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With time you’d also expect this ratio to grow. Vocabulary, especially of commonly used words, is far more limited than number of pictures people can take and with time it becomes harder to create a unique tag. Flickr has tens or even hundred millions of tags, but certainly far less unique ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Graph topography and things like super-nodes not only skew the picture, they can also change the perception and application use. I’ll write more about how in few months, when there will be more knowing and less guessing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tags</title><link href="/tags_.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-02-08T18:01:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:,2006-02-08:tags_.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tags are increasingly popular and rightfully so. I’ve built my share of applications with their own taxonomies and I’m certain they simply don’t work. They sort of work if they were built for specialized needs and are used only by trained, disciplined people with excellent organizational skills.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Which means almost never.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tags (aka folksonomies) are messy. There’s no real system, any bozo can attach whatever it wants and you’d be a fool to blindly trust any specific tag. They are the worst possible system apart from everything else we tried so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why we decided to implement them in Marela. Language used on Marela is Slovene and that led to slightly different design that commonly found elsewhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We decided to treat multiple words separated with spaces as one tag and use commas as a delimiters between different tags. First reason for this is that tagging something like
    &lt;em&gt;
     New Zealand
    &lt;/em&gt;
    becomes more natural. The other was that in Slovene compound words like handbag are very often separate words. For example, handbag would be
    &lt;em&gt;
     ro??na torbica
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another problem, which we haven’t tackled yet, but probably will have to, is that Slovene is
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_grammar" title="Short description on Wikipedia"&gt;
     a complicated language
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in ways that make tagging a nasty problem. There are six cases, but nominative is usually used. Still three different grammatical numbers (singular, dual and plural) together with three different genders (masculine, feminine and neutral) leave multiple options for the same thing. If you were looking for
    &lt;em&gt;
     blue
    &lt;/em&gt;
    objects, you’d need to search at least for tags
    &lt;em&gt;
     modra
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     modro
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     modri
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     modre
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Right now you have to do this manually.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And then there are problems that plaque other tagging systems as well. Most common of them are misspelled words, like
    &lt;em&gt;
     Wein
    &lt;/em&gt;
    instead of
    &lt;em&gt;
     Wien
    &lt;/em&gt;
    for Vienna.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All these lead to a fairly flat tag space with a ratio of 5.6 between all tags and unique ones. I’m not sure how it would change if we treated spaces differently or even what is a common ratio for other languages and other applications. I’m guessing it wouldn’t change the ratio too much because of noun cases, but it remains to be investigated.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, why does it matter?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, that’s a matter for another post, which I’ll probably write tomorrow.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Probably the most common misfortune every creator encounters is that something he thought up doesn’t or won’t work as planned and it has to be changed. In a way half of work is done by just recognizing and accepting that it doesn’t work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But how do you do that?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our change of image navigation was in retrospect quite easy. As a friend said: “You don’t have to satisfy everyone, but you should satisfy at least somebody.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It wasn’t easy for me, because I was quite attached to it and I failed to recognize it as a problem. And this wasn’t even a close call.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, how do you decide when to give in to requests conflicting with your vision?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Relying on a personal hunch might work for a while, but as a long-term strategy it’s probably not much better than rolling a dice.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As noted in my previous post, we changed the way image navigation works on Marela. I already described “philosophical” reason for previous behavior and in this post I intend to visit other reasons and lessons learned.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I liked the old behavior because it made every page recognizable and there were no side effects, no special cases that would require different handling and make interface bigger. It made under-developed mathematician in me feel all fuzzy and warm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I mean by recognizable is that you could quickly tell where on Marela you are just by looking at the displayed page. Hence it should be easy to know how to proceed and what you can do. Very predictable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Except it didn’t matter and nobody cared.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    New behavior brought special cases and I’m quite certain we haven’t met all of them yet. Example of one would be navigating through set of images grouped by a tag and deleting that tag from the current image. Where does that put you?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The picture obviously can’t be a part of that set anymore so its neighbors can’t be from the set either. That’s why you fall back to photo-stream of the author. Except that most people still expect to be inside of the tag-stream. There wouldn’t be much change if we stayed there, only side-effects would be different. We could only select how to confuse users, not if.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As it happens, it’s not a big deal either. It’s confusing at first, but not for very long, so nobody cares.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I relearned is that a tight mathematical model without side-effects, is not necessarily intuitive to human mind. In a way, we compensate for any small idiosyncrasies in a story our brains write from what we do. As with any good writing, we have guidelines that make us write better stories, but at the end it’s not they which matter, but the story itself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Interface should only help telling it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Undiscovered talent</title><link href="/undiscovered-talent.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-01-29T22:43:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:,2006-01-29:undiscovered-talent.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We recently bowed to pressure from our members and changed the way image navigation works. For those familiar with Flickr, let’s say you’ve searched for images with a given tag and selected an image from results page. When you view it, you get thumbnails of its neighbors from author’s photo-stream and not from results one. That’s how Marela used to work, but doesn’t anymore. Previous and next are now context dependent.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our change has been universally well received among our test users and it seems the only unhappy person is me. There are several reasons for this, but in this post I’ll concentrate on just one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    How does unknown new talent get discovered on the web?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are a creator, how do you get your work known? I believe, like
    &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail820.html" title="Podcast from Web 2.0"&gt;
     Barry Diller
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , that there’s a limited amount of talent in the world, but unlike him I don’t think it will necessarily get discovered. I’m not afraid of post-mortem discoveries, although it sucked to be Van Gogh. I’m afraid of talent not being noticed at all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A friend’s wife is studying old greek texts written on papyrus. I thought these things were rare and therefore have all been read, but I was wrong. As it happens, Britain has tons of this stuff and not only haven’t they read all of them, it’s not likely they’ll do it any time soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, if 10 million pages are added to web every day (and with rise of blogs I’d say this number is probably low), how big will this task be in the future? Even worse, if nobody knows of it, who’ll be diligent enough to store and preserve it?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You’re probably reading this words on my blog and there’s a good chance you came here because Google offered this link as a match to your search request. There’s a significantly smaller chance you came from one of the aggregators that follow blog’s feed or even more unlikely, you’re a regular reader who at some point belonged to first or second group of visitors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In effect, I’ve been discovered by you (until I get forgotten), but there were several factors working in my favor. First, I write on topics which these days are fairly fashionable in certain circles. Second, because I mostly write about technological issues, my posts often feature keywords that people might reasonably use while searching and which are related to each other. It’s therefore possible to extract an idea of what I’m writing about even with rather crude tools available now and for Google to rank my page highly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What if I didn’t? If I was a writer of short stories?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With little or no related keywords and texts without a common theme, it would be very difficult for Googles of this world to understand my writings and even less how valuable it might be to someone else. Algorithms to extract the theme of a text exist, but we are practically completely naked when it comes to evaluating quality and talent. So pages like that will never crawl out of the depths of Google index.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since computers can’t do it, we usually rely on humans. If you like this, then you might like something liked by others, who also liked this. The problem however remains. Such scheme can only promote works that somebody else already liked and to be liked, it has to be seen first.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s another, more fundamental reason, why search engines and searching can’t solve this. Motivations are wrong. Unlike browsing you know what you’re looking for and need to have at least a vague idea how to describe it to be successful. That description and intent alone limits what you can find. The other problem is that search engines don’t care about variety, they care about best fit. Neither do we, users, at least most of the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we want to discover, we first have to be willing to get lost.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most people plan their vacations and so do we. There’s nothing wrong with this and I’m sure we’d enjoy them less if we didn’t. However, some of my most vivid and precious memories are of things we didn’t plan at all, which just happened against our plan.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is what I was trying to do. I tried to create a small alley, where you could end up by accident and discover something completely new, but from which it would be very easy to get to the main street and also very obvious. It even worked, but our members didn’t like the experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have no illusion that my dropped feature alone wouldn’t solve this problem, but I can’t help feeling we might have made a step in wrong direction. Maybe I tried to solve a problem which doesn’t exist, but isn’t this akin to saying we have enough culture and shouldn’t produce more?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When I was in Stockholm, I listened to a podcast of Bran Ferren’s talk at Web 2.0 conference. He made a case that knowledge workers need tools and user interfaces that put increased productivity as a goal above ease of use or learn. It’s well worth
    &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail852.html"&gt;
     listening to
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , if you haven’t heard it yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The point is certainly valid even if mouse and other stuff Doug Engelbart invented were created with this same goal in mind. I disagree partially with iPod example, since I believe easy of use is what made iPod wildly popular instead of something like Creative Zen (which still can’t get real traction in the market), but there’s a need and opportunity for tools that make us more productive. I’d count Unix command line between them, which makes me more productive even if it’s not easy to use and even less to learn. There’s a problem though.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nobody is a knowledge worker in every field.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or as Alan Cooper
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672316498/ref=ase_codinghorror-20/102-1133436-5350547?s=books&amp;amp;v=glance&amp;amp;n=283155&amp;amp;tagActionCode=codinghorror-20"&gt;
     said
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , we are perpetual intermediates who most of the time want to learn only as much as needed but not more. We can be experts only in very few things. We have neither the time nor inclination to become proficient with everything we do and do we have the tools to make other endeavors as painless as possible?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think when talking about gadgets and computers the answer is generally no.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem lies not in keyboard and mouse. They are general purpose tools (like hammer) widely used mainly because computers are also general purpose tools and most of us use them as such. When specific needs become crystalized enough, we usually get input devices to match, like tablets for designers or joysticks for gamers. I’m sure more could be done and Bran seems to be the kind of person who will do it, but I don’t think it’s where computers fail us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it’s the software, which should be either fun and easy to use or make us more productive, preferably both but by large does neither of those.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll be the first to admit that iPods are rare and you’ll often find (as with Unix CLI) that you have to choose between making a more productive tool and making more fun one. But not being a beginner is not a permission to abuse me and most software would benefit if it dropped the pretense of being an expert tool and rather worked really hard on being easy to manipulate. As a rule of thumb, if you can’t charge at least 300$ for it, it’s not an expert tool.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is what we are tying to do with
    &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si"&gt;
     Marela
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,  it’s our mission. We have and will continue to work on making life in digital age enjoyable. It’s big and ambitious enough goal to keep us busy for a while.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And I still think mouse was just a brilliant invention.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    According to Steve Jobs at Macworld Apple sold 14 million iPods in last quarter of 2005 and 32 million during the whole year. iPod remains by far the most popular portable mp3 player even though it’s neither the cheapest or the most feature laden of available options.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what is it that makes iPod so popular and what does that tell us?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For the purpose of this post I’ll talk about the whole family of iPod products as one, since I believe that my points can be more or less equally applied to all of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     1. Easy interface = happy users
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Using iPod is very easy and when something is easy to do, it’s more likely to also be enjoyable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    iPod achieves this mainly by using familiar elements (playlists, slideshows…) and sticking to simple usage model. Even wheel is just an evolved volume knob from hi-fi equipment. Which doesn’t make it less innovative.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Exceptions to the mental model are expensive, since they significantly raise the cognitive burden and should therefore be reserved only for occasions when their benefits far outweigh their downsides.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     2. Number of features is not important. Their selection is.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As already noted, iPod isn’t the player with most features. It’s not even the player with most features per buck.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a common fallacy to think you need more features than competition. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t add any. A product should certainly meet baseline expectations and have features most of its customers expect. But you should be careful that those it has significantly add to the purpose of the tool.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Don’t try to build a swiss army knife.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     3. If you build it (expansion option), they will come (developers).
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can’t add every feature and you shouldn’t even if you could. However you should make it possible for other developers to build on top of your product. This way everybody wins.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Your budget can be smaller, majority is not bothered with features it doesn’t want or need, but somebody else can add them for those who do. That’s why web services matter and you should think about adding them if you haven’t yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     4. Less is more (minimalism rules)
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Less design, less features, less burden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s like going on a trip. You can’t take everything you might possibly need with you. You have to decide what’s useful or important enough and make it fit within limitations imposed on you either by airlines or your own body.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;

    Nobody wants to watch ugly stuff. If we are going to look at it, then it should be pleasant to do so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Flashy designs might get your attention at first, but they age quickly more often than not. Light, understated design might not be so eye catchy, but it’s this inconspicuousness that makes them usable over longer periods of time.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    To sum up, when I think of iPod, two words come to my mind. Easy and restrained. Are these the same two words you’d use to describe your website?

    This is another news that I missed while I was busy elsewhere. Developers have added
    &lt;a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/darin/archives/009594.html"&gt;
     a ping attribute
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to link elements in the latest builds of Firefox.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Ping attribute allows website producers to specify URLs that will get pinged when user clicks on a link with this attribute. Meaning, it makes user tracking easier.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Argument being that tracking was already going on using redirects and that this feature will allow users to control this and makes browsing faster (by avoiding redirects).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can see the logic, but I’m not sure I agree with developer’s conclusion. Redirects were at least visible to a user and he had a choice of continuing to use such web site or going elsewhere. Pings can be turned off by those, who know this option exists, but tracking will certainly be less transparent to everybody else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m still on the fence about this one. How about you?

   &lt;p&gt;
    Quite a lot has happened during time when I was away from this blog and I’ll probably talk about some of it in next few days, but I’d like to start with news from Google.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wrote a
    &lt;a href="do-a-lesser-evil.html"&gt;
     badly written post
    &lt;/a&gt;
    when Google Talk was unveiled. What bothered me most was the fact that it didn’t communicate with anybody and was in fact another walled garden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, they
    &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html" title="Open federation announcement"&gt;
     fixed it
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and Google Talk now actually talks to other jabber servers including ours.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are some problems with presence notification, but it’s hard to say yet who’s fault it is and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was ours. Sad thing about jabber is that there are few if any open source server implementations that wouldn’t be just a notch above suck.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short run this won’t change much. Most people will still be on competing services and it might be difficult to get them off. But as a newborn optimist I see a promise of an open, working IM, where you’re not tied to wishes and development of one company even when that company is mine. And that can only be good.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Have you ever encountered a problem with XMLHttpRequest (XHR), where its handler couldn’t read request status or the status was set to 0?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, I did, a few days ago.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It took me a while to find the cause of this problem and in my case it was form submission. It’s stupid to use AJAX to submit a form, but nevertheless it’s what I’m doing for dubious reasons that I’ll probably be ashamed of in a few months or years. And it used to work fine, until I changed submit buttons from
    &lt;em&gt;
     type=”button”
    &lt;/em&gt;
    to
    &lt;em&gt;
     type=”image”
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First type needs javascript to do anything worthwhile, while second type submits form when pressed, which I somehow missed. So, when I thought I was sending only a normal XHR request, I was actually also submitting my form which lead to described strange behavior.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have no idea why, since XHR state change handler shouldn’t be triggered by other requests, but it was and it was fixed by simply canceling form submission in image button
    &lt;em&gt;
     onclick
    &lt;/em&gt;
    handler.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you ever encounter this problem, check your forms and their submit buttons. It’s very likely that solution is hiding there.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a few hours I’ll be going on a trip to Stockholm, so this is probably the last post of this year. It also happens to be the 100th post since it was started six months ago, making it a perfect place to recapitulate this year and this blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It has become a custom by now to flood web with such articles at this time of the year, so I’ve decided to limit mine to a much less talked topic, a state of web in Slovenia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s certainly been an interesting year. We’ve experienced a rise of web standards
    &lt;a href="http://www.siol.net/"&gt;
     based
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.bof.si/main.cp2"&gt;
     designs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and even got
    &lt;a href="http://rkg.gov.si/GERK/"&gt;
     first slovenian AJAX application
    &lt;/a&gt;
    intended for wide use. Truth be told, I don’t really know when it was launched, since I more or less stumbled upon it, but it seems that until this year, most of my colleagues weren’t aware of it either. Also it’s the year when feeds started to appear on prominent websites (with most of the public blissfully ignorant of them).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sadly, it’s still safe to say that most new designs were done with table-based layouts and many table-less left much to be desired. Most of them are abusing or flatly ignoring semantic part of HTML tags and drowning in superfluous div’s. Little thought is spent on usability and even less on accessibility of new sites.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As customary by now, we seem to be lagging at least a couple of years behind the world. Slovenian web of 2005 is still very much the web of closed gardens. Feeds may have appeared, but their shy use is limited and there are few if any public APIs for developers to use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I expect this will change in new year with public launch of
    &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si"&gt;
     Marela
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and hopefully other new services. Still, we’re not pioneers and it seems we don’t want to be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On a personal front, it’s been a very busy, but also a very good year for me. Our service is about to go from a closed beta to more open one and first signs from our users are very positive. We started
    &lt;a href="http://web.zen.si"&gt;
     a series
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of web related talks through which I met many, from whom I’ve learned a lot. There’s more talent out there than I was aware of and it certainly gave me hope for the future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I discovered the fun of writing and had a good fortune of having insightful readers who helped me tame my ignorance at least a bit. There were more of you reading this blog than I probably deserve and certainly many more than I’ve ever expected. I’m grateful to you all.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So to end this all, what are my blog resolutions for the new year?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wrote more frequently than I first expected and probably should. In new year I’ll try to reduce the number of posts in favor of more useful content and prose that doesn’t feel like chewing cardboard.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll try to write shorter posts except when content actually demands a longer one. I’d also like to hear what my readers would like to see more or less of so if you can spare a moment or two, please drop me a line in the comments.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wish everyone all the best in new year.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This has been bugging me ever since I’ve heard a podcast of Vinod Khosla at Web 2.0 conference a couple of days ago, who touched on a theme that seems to crop up in Slovenia every now and then. He said something along the lines of there’s less need for teaching facts to children today, because they can find them online. Instead they should learn how to think critically and how to sort through information.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No arguement from me about the thinking and sorting part. They are skills definitely needed today more than ever, which seem to be sorely lacking in many, if not most people. Improving them can only be better for them and society as a whole.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I disagree strongly about the need to teach facts though. Current approach to teach them may be wrong, but if anything, we know too few and not too many of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First problem is that you need to know something to be able to ask a question at all. If I take the title question as an example, there are three keywords in it: dutch, painter and diplomat. Dropping any of them would probably lead to a different result and likely never to the same one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The less we know, less questions we can dare to ask. Without facts, there’ll be less we’ll be able to imagine. Ideas are not something that comes from a thin air. They are offspring of the things we already know. They may be a descendant of a previous idea, but if we trace it back far enough we’ll sooner or later find an ancestor which will be a fact.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We might also know enough to get by in our every day life, but in a society where creativity is growing in importance, it’s probably not enough. Knowledge is the soil on which creativity grows. Richer the soil, richer its crop.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What we know doesn’t only limit to what we can aspire, it also defines who we already are. It’s easy to think of knowledge as something that can be separated into useful and useless. Useful being any piece of knowledge that we get to directly apply at least now and then (like basic arithmetics or driving a car) or clairvoyantly know we’ll need some day and useless being everything else. It’s easy and it’s wrong.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We were molded by whole of it, not just with the parts we happen to like or use. We can’t desire what we don’t know and it’s easier to fear unknown. What we know is largely who we are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve spent most of my life learning as much as I can about as many subjects as possible; about some of them even very deeply. But I wonder if I’ll ever stop feeling being an ignoramus. Acknowledging the limits of personal knowledge and wisdom isn’t an absolution from its pursuit. And it should never be one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    P.S: The answer to the question in this post title is Peter Paul Rubens. I’d like to know enough to tell if he’s the only one.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A light bulb in our hall died a while ago and it has taken me ages to unscrew it. To my defense, this is not your normal light bulb and the procedure involved a variety of tools, a ladder, few missteps and a couple of moments of fear. You tend to become a bit of a chicken as you get older.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So today we were shopping for a replacement. Not the best day in year to do so, but since we were already out and near the store, it just made sense to fetch it. Experience has certainly been educational.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We visited a store close to our home near the center of Ljubljana, which has been hit hard by newer stores that opened in suburbs. Easier parking, bigger choice and at least competitive if not cheaper prices do that to you and it’s doubtful, if you can survive something like this in the long run. It seems to me the only possible competitive advantage left is having a superior customer experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However it’s hard to imagine that this would mean getting a shop assistant to print out a receipt that you need to carry to the only cash register in the store where you’re served by an unbelievably rude clerk who loudly lets everyone know that she’ll be gone in ten minutes if there’s her replacement or not.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t see myself going back again. But I was reminded of a problem observed many times before. Company problems lead to demoralized workers, which lead to work done poorly and that to even more problems for the company. It’s a vicious self-destructing cycle that is not easy to break and just as hard times can’t be completely avoided.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But you’ll be gone if your customers suffer too much and it’s absolutely amazing that so often they still don’t get much more than a lip service. It’s about meeting their needs and nothing else. Good customer experience is the cheapest advertisement there is. It’s also the most effective one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now I only need to replace the light bulb.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I first heard of structured blogging a few days ago and at first I thought it was an excellent idea. I mean which geek wouldn’t like its promise?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, the more I think about it, the more skeptical I am. I’m not the first and other people said it better than I could. Shelley Powers
    &lt;a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/12/19/aint-no-cobwebs-here/"&gt;
     questions
    &lt;/a&gt;
    the need for such a thing since modern publishing tools should provide more sensible, tailor-made solution. I may be down on WordPress, but this is something it gets right today. Paul Kedrosky
    &lt;a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/002215.html"&gt;
     sees
    &lt;/a&gt;
    user laziness as a problem, which might limit SB to enterprise as
    &lt;a href="http://gilbane.com/blog/archives/2005/12/post.html"&gt;
     pointed out
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Frank Gilbane.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I basically agree with all of them. First I don’t like the current implementation with embedded x-subnode format. I’m trying to move stuff like CSS and Javascript out of the document and it seems odd that I would now litter the same document with different kind of inline data. Contained blocks are a different representation of content and not a script, so it smells of tag abuse as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like microformats, but that’s because I find it clever how you can use names to add meaning and structure to what you already have. It can be a cheap way to add value to existing data. In my opinion they are most suitable for pages that need multiple formats to describe contained data and each of them represents a fairly small chunk of the whole page.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then there’s a question how you can get this data. I think there are 4 ways you get data from users:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     it’s fun for them to do so
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     benefits to them by far outweigh the pain of providing the data
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     by accident
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     it’s forced upon them
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It certainly isn’t fun. It’s difficult enough for me to select categories in which to put a certain post. Often they don’t fit in just one, so which interface would I have to use then?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And why? There are no immediate benefits or at least not any obvious ones. That strikes option number two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By accident simply means what we already have. Google seems to be good at getting information out of unstructured data, but it’s certainly not what SB was supposed to be. Strike number three.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what we are left with is environment with little choice, more often referred to as a job. It certainly not a novel idea, although it probably hasn’t been applied to blogs yet. I’m not all that convinced it will be, but I’m willing to be surprised.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Conclusion? No, thanks (for now).
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A while ago I wrote a
    &lt;a href="wordpress-sucks.html"&gt;
     post
    &lt;/a&gt;
    berating
    &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;
     WordPress
    &lt;/a&gt;
    UI that got more attention than I wanted. I still stand behind my words, but I’d rather be known for something else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hearing that new WordPress is around the corner, I was eager to write something more positive. Thanks to
    &lt;a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/" title="Shelley's blog"&gt;
     Shelley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , I got a chance to test new WordPress (WP from now on) and see for myself improvements they made.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First the good news. WP provides a new WYSIWYG editor (
    &lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;
     tinyMCE
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) that certainly makes editing easier. It does just what you’d expect it to. I also like improved post preview, which uses
    &lt;em&gt;
     iframe
    &lt;/em&gt;
    to show post in real environment, using theme of the blog. This has been something that really bothered me in current version, since it makes post preview barely usable. Previews are also available for themes, so you can see what blog should look like before you apply the theme.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    WP has been “ajaxified??? and mostly for the better. For example you can add a new category while editing post. UI has been somewhat simplified by arranging it in boxes that can be closed or opened according to user’s need. User can also reorder them and since WP remembers their position and state, it’s a fairly effective way to customize UI to personal needs. Nice. I wish reordering was extended to other lists (e.g. links), but for all I know, this might be fixed by the time of 2.0 release.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, my old complaints are still valid. While posts can be edited by other people of appropriate level, this hasn’t been extended to pages. Not a week passes by in which I wouldn’t bump against this limitation. Theme editor still gives you the same stupid choice between security and usefulness.  User interface is more flexible, but still largely the same and often overloaded. There’s only so much that can be achieved by hiding stuff in boxes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nevertheless, WP 2.0 is a big step forward. Even bigger under the hood according to what I hear, but since I can’t be made to care about PHP, it’s not all that relevant to me. I certainly don’t think it sucks anymore, but I still think it has a far way to go before it will truly be a friendly tool for everyone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    Holidays are closer with each day and it’s getting harder and harder to concentrate on work, when your mind is occupied with loot coming your way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s also a time of the year when web sites are filled with various summations of year left behind and always present guesses about the future. I certainly am not above that and I’ll probably add a line or two of my own in next few days, but I also wanted to finish my little javascript i18n library before the year ends. I don’t want it to turn into a pumpkin at midnight like some girl’s ride back home.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You know, sort of a present for everyone as it befits this holiday.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Alas, it’s taking longer then planned. So many things to do and so little time. Since trip to Stockholm is just around the corner, I decided to release what I believe by now to be practically usable piece of localization code. If you’re interested just in the goods, then you can see new javascript file
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/3/translate.js" title="Javascript i18n library"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and demo
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/3/index.html" title="Javascript i18n demo"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There have been few changes since
    &lt;a href="look-ma-html-too.html" title="Previous post on this topic"&gt;
     last time
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . The whole thing has been objectified, but I kept  few functions (
    &lt;em&gt;
     stripStr
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     stripStrML
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and new one
    &lt;em&gt;
     printf
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ) outside of a class, since they’re too general to belong there. Nice thing about new class is that instead of looking for globally defined translation dictionary, it’s initialized with one. This also means you can use more than one translation object or translation dictionary per page, which sounds cool even if not all that useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I made a small correction to method
    &lt;em&gt;
     toEntity
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . A bug was pointed out to me by
    &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com"&gt;
     Opera browser
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is a great browser for testing against standards, if not common sense. I might think it’s OK to fetch a character out of a string with their index value, as you would fetch an element from a list or an object, but I would be wrong. That’s why a string method
    &lt;em&gt;
     charAt
    &lt;/em&gt;
    was defined and if working everywhere except in Opera is not good enough for you, then you must use this method. So, I did.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also renamed the function
    &lt;em&gt;
     _
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . It’s a nifty name widely used in other languages, but it doesn’t work quite like that when it’s a method in an object.
    &lt;em&gt;
     init.js
    &lt;/em&gt;
    demonstrates how you can still use it by defining an anonymous function.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is it for now. I think the library is actually usable, but it’s also lacking few things.
    &lt;em&gt;
     printf
    &lt;/em&gt;
    provides now a method of easily stitching  stings together and even using parameters in translations. However, it does require that those parameters are listed in same order as in original text. Better than previously, but still often awkward.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What’s missing is also a tool to translate between javascript dictionary/object and a widely used translation format like
    &lt;em&gt;
     GNU’s gettext
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . I’m currently working on this and I hope to have something usable ready in next few days.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last but not least, it needs a useful documentation on how to use it and work with it. It will get it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update: It turns out my code might be usable, but it’s certainly not good. Some issues were listed in
    &lt;/em&gt;

     &lt;a href="revisiting-javascript-i18n.html"&gt;
      later
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     post and some I discovered just recently. For instance it won’t work if you’re trying to translate text on buttons or if text to be translated includes HTML tags (case of tags is not preserved in DOM tree, which wouldn’t be a problem if Firefox and IE defaulted to the same one).
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to be a part-time system administrator and have a few colleagues who still are. So I’m fairly used to regular complaints about (l)users and a delusional sense of self-importance. Yet, it’s still a rare week in which I’d read a bunch of articles (with comments) like
    &lt;a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html"&gt;
     this one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and had so many discussions about what and how should our users behave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think most comments were simply rubbish. You have no reason to complain as long as they are polite and not intentionally obstructive.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The thing I always admired about
    &lt;a href="http://www.mobitel.si"&gt;
     Mobitel
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is the way they treat their customers. It doesn’t matter how little do they know about phones, phone plans or even their own needs and desires, you can be sure that Mobitel’s personnel will take the time and energy necessary to explain, show and resolve whatever is needed. They certainly don’t expect me to come loaded with information and spend more of my time to save theirs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I know next to nothing about plumbing and I’m sure it’s a fact well known and obvious to every plumber I’ve met. But did they ever treat me like an idiot? No, because it’s understood that they have to know so I don’t have to. I simply can’t know everything and wouldn’t want to, because there are other, more important things that I should be doing. I might help with my answers to their questions, but it’s not really expected of me to do anything more than to show the problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I understand frustrations when dealing with too many problems and too little time. I also know that there’s always a small percentage of users who simply are assholes. I don’t believe it’s ever acceptable to be impolite, but I understand it sometimes happens.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Life can be hard, but it doesn’t change the fact that our task is to provide a service, to serve our users and not the other way around. And if we have a problem doing this, it’s us who must resolve it not them. In fact, without them  “pests” there’s little need for what we provide. After all a perfectly configured and RFC compliant mail server is just a box of toxic waste without someone sending emails through it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Some professions get this. As Woody Allen rightly pointed out, it really is a bitch to get a plumber (on Sunday).
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Yesterday I wrote about my wish of making background
    &lt;em&gt;
     POST
    &lt;/em&gt;
    requests that don’t get accidentally canceled. I wasn’t specific enough. You can create background
    &lt;em&gt;
     POST
    &lt;/em&gt;
    requests just fine with
    &lt;em&gt;
     XMLHttpRequest
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , but you can’t use such requests for file uploads, which is what I want.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My first try was to post
    &lt;em&gt;
     form
    &lt;/em&gt;
    to
    &lt;em&gt;
     iframe
    &lt;/em&gt;
    in a different window. This didn’t work because browsers pay attention to source of request. Activating new request in source window immediately cancels previous unfinished one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A better idea was provided by always helpful
    &lt;a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" title="Dojo toolkit"&gt;
     dojo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    developers. Clone
    &lt;em&gt;
     form
    &lt;/em&gt;
    to progress window and submit it from there. This one works great in Firefox, but hardly anywhere else. It certainly doesn’t work in IE, since IE is very picky about what you do with nodes created with
    &lt;em&gt;
     cloneNode
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and you can’t clone form yourself, since it’s not possible to set the value of file upload elements.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Is this game over for unobtrusive file upload?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not yet. There are still at least two posibilities, both with downsides, but one of them definitely works. You can open file upload form in new window and change that window to progress bar. It works and I use it occasionally, but it’s not nice if you care about accessibility. It’s something users can do now, if they want, by opening upload page in new tab or window.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other, yet untried, possible solution would be to avoid cloning. Just rip the form out from original page, move it to status one and submit form there. Obvious problems with this one are that users lose information about what they’re uploading and that it can look confusing if not executed well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll try it anyway and will let you know how it goes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Update: IE also dislikes ripping and moving.

    I have a kinky wish. I’d like to submit a web form that wouldn’t get canceled if I clicked another link before its completion.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Browsers normally don’t work like this. They interpret subsequent clicks on active elements as a change of heart on user’s part and cancel previous clicks in favor of last one. Most of the time this is exactly what you’d want and expect.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, sometimes it isn’t. I’d like to open a new window for upload progress bar and release the old one so users can continue working without waiting for upload to finish. I suspect it can’t be done though.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

    This is a second post in hopefully a very short series dedicated to javascript internationalization. If you want, you can read the first one
    &lt;a href="solving-javascript-i18n-as-work-in-progress.html"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We left off with two supporting functions for striping whitespace and a simple function for translation lookup. Today I added another two functions, one for translating HTML elements and the other for resolving a problem with HTML entities. You can find new javascript
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/2/translate.js"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and a demo
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/2/index.html"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     translateNodes
    &lt;/em&gt;
    searches for elements with class name i18n, picks up their text content and translates it, if it can find it in translation dictionary. Sometimes it can’t, because what javascript actually sees is a real utf-8 encoded string, where X/HTML entities have been replaced with characters they represent. If this is not true also for source string in dictionary, then there’s a mismatch.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why there’s
    &lt;em&gt;
     toEntity
    &lt;/em&gt;
    function which translates all non-ASCII characters in given string to their entity representation. When
    &lt;em&gt;
     translateNodes
    &lt;/em&gt;
    fails to find translation, it uses
    &lt;em&gt;
     toEntity
    &lt;/em&gt;
    to get a possibly different representation and tries again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This way you can use entities, which are the only real cross-browser way to describe non-ASCII chars and translations still work. There’s a downside though. Your translation source string must either have all non-ASII characters represented as HTML entities or none of them. Otherwise translation will fail for obvious reasons.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are planned limitations (like building a system that handles only utf-8 text) and unplanned ones. I still don’t do anything special for strings with significant whitespace (like content of a
    &lt;em&gt;
     pre
    &lt;/em&gt;
    tag) and probably should.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Do nothing = I break it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be nice, if I started to pack this functionality in a more sensible form and build tools that make handling of the whole thing easier.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Next week, which starts in an hour or so, seems perfect time for that.

    Have you ever asked yourself, what’s the purpose of Google’s long living cookie?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, others
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=google+cookie"&gt;
     did
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m not quite as paranoid as some of them, but judging by recent experience it’s definitely used for more than just preferences. I was helping my wife and was looking for term
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=conventions+scope"&gt;
     “conventions and scope”
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , when I’ve noticed that I get completely different answers than she does.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t know about you, but my results are obviously aimed at programmers unlike those of my wife. Google therefore clearly uses their cookie to learn from stuff I searched for about stuff I might in future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have no problem with this provided my profile is anonymous. My problem with Google was different. How do I get rid of its bias that normally works in my favor, but every now and then doesn’t?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I know I can turn cookie support off in my browser and that would solve my problem. However, I’m doubtful that many users know this. Should web application offer a way to turn off such bias and if yes, how? Should they reveal it in the first place?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think they should, but I understand it can be difficult to do so without looking intrusive. That’s why they usually bury it in documents that nobody reads, like terms of use or privacy statements.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    When we designed
    &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si"&gt;
     Marela
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , we obviously wanted to make it as close to perfect as possible, but we paid even more attention than usual to words and language used, since I find bad copy consistently the most annoying element of web site design.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This might look odd coming from me. But not being a chef doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy or respect good cooking. So I read articles like
    &lt;a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/resurrect_your_writing_redeem_your_soul/"&gt;
     this one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , hope that more people would do the same and try to do my best. I think we’re doing alright so far; no doubt largely because there are enough capable and caring souls fixing after me my stupidity and sloppiness.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If the tone and words used influence how we feel and percept others in our daily communications, why is it so difficult to imagine that this is equaly true when communicating through a web site or user interface? It’s still communication.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And to make this post at least moderately useful, I give you a short and far from complete list of words used in tech industry and what they actually mean:

    &lt;/li&gt;

     works most of the time
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

     &lt;/strong&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A while ago I was moaning about a sad state of javascript i18n tools. When I finally started working on it, I faced a dilemma.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Should I wait until it’s finished and then reveal it like Moses to chosen people? Look guys what I etched with a toothpick during my lunch time break! You know, I was waiting for my Crème Brûlée and had to kill those few pesky minutes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or should I choose a more honest approach, showing steps and missteps between embarrassing first version and hopefully usable last?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, there’s nothing better than public humiliation to instill some humility so let’s see what is behind the door number two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The goal is still the same. Develop a short and relatively fast library that allows you to translate javascript code and HTML content and to do so with as little fuss as possible and with a clear separation between HTML, javascript and translations, but without breaking pages in case translation doesn’t exist yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/translate.js" title="Translation functions"&gt;
     here’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    my humble start together with a
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/index.html" title="Link to demonstration page"&gt;
     simple demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Three functions, two of them a support needed later on. stripStr and stripStrML just strip whitespace at the start and end of string with stripStrML doing it on every line of a given string. We’ll need this later on so we can find strings to translate even if they are enclosed in whitespace to make source display more pretty.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then there’s a function called _, which takes a string and translates it if javascript object i18nDict exists and has this string as an attribute with a non empty value. Otherwise it just returns the same string, so it doesn’t break page even if translation doesn’t exist in
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/i18n.js" title="Translation dictionary"&gt;
     translation object
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s what is usually called a proof of concept prototype.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s it for today. I’ll try to post updates every couple of days or so, if progress warrants it.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I started playing with AJAX before it got its silly name and true to X I used XML in my application. At least at first.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I discovered is that flicker caused by processing data and simultaneously writing results to document can be completely removed if I do a Google and fetch javascript object instead (what later became
    &lt;a href="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/index.html"&gt;
     JSON
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) and use that. Difference was so vivid, I dropped XML almost completely.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Fast forward to autumn. There’s a debate after our regular weekly talk and a question comes up. Why would Google or anyone else for that matter choose to use something else than XML?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Relying on personal experience I offered speed as obvious and most important reason. I couldn’t back it up, but since I’ve seen it with my own eyes, I didn’t doubt it either. It wasn’t the sole reason. I find dabbling with javascript objects simply easier than handling XML and I’ll care about XSLT when javascript in Safari can access it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I got reminded of our discussion when I read
    &lt;a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2005/11/30/tuning-ajax-performance.html"&gt;
     this article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Read it, if you haven’t yet, because it’s well worth it. Anyhow, I decided to make a new test. I wrote a simple
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/test.html"&gt;
     test page
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , that fetches
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/jssample.raw"&gt;
     sample json file
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and basically equal
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/xmlsample.xml"&gt;
     xml sample
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and measures how much time it takes to fetch same data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Result?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After 15 minutes of wild reloading in different browsers (Safari 1.3+, FF1.0, IE6) and different local and non-local servers, I can’t see a difference that couldn’t be attributed to latency. It seems browsers have moved on and there’s little reason to avoid using XML today.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So use whatever you like most.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    Jensen Harris posted an interesting
    &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/11/29/497861.aspx"&gt;
     observation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    few days ago regarding “help” in programs. Microsoft’s usability tests showed that help is mainly used by experts and enthusiasts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t have data to back or refute his observations, but I did check our logs to see how often is our help accessed and the number is so low that I’ve seem to have talked about it with practically everyone who actually visited it. Sure enough, all of them belong to more experienced users who probably need it the least
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#invhelp1-2005-12-04"&gt;
      1
     &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a name="invhelp01-2005-12-04"&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So let’s assume that Harris is correct and inexperienced users don’t access help. I think there are three basic questions you’re faced with when designing a help system
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#invhelp2-2005-12-04"&gt;
      2
     &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a name="invhelp02-2005-12-04"&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    :
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     How do you get users to discover and use help?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     How do you meet the needs of those who do?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     What about the rest?
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Harris’ observation doesn’t change questions, but it does lead to possibly different answers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    1. How do you get users to discover and use help?
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The least you can do is to make it accessible from a standard place, which is in the top right corner and to make it easily recognizable. If everyone says it’s Help, you should too and don’t hide it with small font size (we might be guilty of this) or inappropriate colors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We tried to go further than this by also offering various means of help in close proximity to where we think our members might appreciate it. It’s still too early for any conclusive remarks, but compared to general use of our help, I’d say it’s showing good promise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    2. How do you meet the needs of those who do?
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If Harris is right and I believe he probably is, then this translates to what are the needs of experienced users and how to meet them?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What we have so far is simply a FAQ of real questions that have been asked previously. It’s amazing how many companies think FAQ is a place where they should put questions they’d like users to ask.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not much and certainly not enough, but there’s been little need for more so far. What I’d like to add is tips and other ways to deepen the knowledge of those, who’d like to do so, but so far we’ve lacked the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve certainly discovered that absence of tutorials teaching basic use of our service is not a problem. At least not so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;
    3. What about the rest?
   &lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No matter how hard you work to make your product simple to use and how easy it is to get to help for it, there will be people who won’t know how to use it and either can’t or won’t use help. How do you help them?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One way is to make mistakes really cheap. Everything that delays a successful completion of intended task is a burden, a price payed not in money, but in satisfaction. We’re trying really hard to make it as cheap as possible with lightning fast pages and non-destructive interfaces where it’s easy to fix mistakes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it’s already clear that this approach works very well. I believe it’s partially responsible why our help section is rarely used.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are options like tooltips, that we haven’t used yet. There are probably options we haven’t thought of. We’ll try new stuff and when we do, I’ll let you know what we’ve learned.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Notes:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a name="invhelp1-2005-12-04"&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
     Before I go on I should point out that it would be nice to think that we got our interface right and most people don’t need to visit our help section. However, without data to back that up it could also mean help is just too difficult to find. It’s something we’ll have to investigate.
     &lt;a href="#invhelp01-2005-12-04"&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a name="invhelp2-2005-12-04"&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
     I assume that all conscientious designers strive for a design that would remove the need for help. I also recognize that this is often not possible.
     &lt;a href="#invhelp02-2005-12-04"&gt;
      ↑
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I’ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This week was a bit special with higher frequency of errors than usual on account of my talk. First I became Marko Semastur. Then a day or so later Makro Samastur was in vogue, which it’ll remain to be until the subtitles on footage are changed. I find the tech
    &lt;a href="http://www.insultmonger.com/swearing/mauritius.htm"&gt;
     pimp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    connotation of Makro highly amusing, but not quite a T-shirt material.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was talking to a friend yesterday who’d like to put up a website displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can’t say I persuaded even myself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I’d like to know is how important do you think is your name or the name you choose for a company for your recognition and success?

    I love going to our weekly web talks not so much for the talks themselves (although they are great), but conversations you get to have there. A part of a recent one rendered from memory and shortened for readers pleasure:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Fry:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Those delete strings of yours should really be post requests.
     &lt;a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/" title="Link to web accelerator that shouldn't be used"&gt;
      GA’s
     &lt;/a&gt;
     pre-fetching might destroy user’s data.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Me:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     &amp;lt;beeeeep&amp;gt; Google. RFC says should not must.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Fry:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Well, since it also says multiple GET requests should yield same result, it really is a must for delete.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Me
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     (not ready to give up): True, but so many form buttons will look like crap.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Fry:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Well, you can hide them by removing border, setting background-color to background and fixing font size to 1 em.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Me:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Uhm, this might work, but probably doesn’t, because browsers use controls from operating system.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Fry:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Well, try it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I may be stubborn, but I’m not a complete moron. So I did and here’s
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/hidebutton.html" title="Demo"&gt;
     the result
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As can be seen, it works beautifully in Firefox (1.0+) and Opera 8 (I share my visitors indifference to earlier versions). It doesn’t work in Safari at all, but since its buttons are not obnoxiously ugly, I can live with that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, it has unseemly big padding in Internet Explorer, which is the real deal-breaker for now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think demo’s style sheet is pretty self explanatory, but here’s what I did by mostly following Fry’s instructions:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     set border to 0
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     same for padding and margin
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     set background-color of the button to the same value as background of the document
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     did the same for color of text
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     set the size of button text to 1 em so it’s displayed in right size in every browser
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     set cursor to pointer, since it’s not done automatically for buttons
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.friedcellcollective.net/" title="Fry's web home"&gt;
     Fry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was also correct that bold and italics work and underline doesn’t, but you can simulate later with border-bottom. Except in IE of course, on account of padding.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s another shortcoming to consider. If background is an image or a color gradient instead of a solid color, this trick won’t work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, any ideas about what to do with IE?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

     FSF Europe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has prepared a
    &lt;a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/ipred2.en.html"&gt;
     short document
    &lt;/a&gt;
    describing problems with IPRED2, the new “Intellectual Property” rights directive from European Union. If passed, it could lead to jail sentences for intellectual property violators. Proposal doesn’t distinguish between kinds of intellectual property, but it does limit itself to sadly undefined willful infringement.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not being a lawyer makes it hard to judge, if FSF’s objections are valid. According to
    &lt;a href="http://wiki.ffii.de/IpredEp051122En"&gt;
     a report
    &lt;/a&gt;
    from FFII, big IP companies are not happy with it either. Directive’s proposal certainly leaves a lot to interpretation and FSF’s scenario doesn’t seem far fetched. Especially for those of us who’ve seen how difficult it can be for lawyers to agree on anything.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short, it’s another piece of ill-considered legislation that wants to help entertainment industry in their fight against reality at the expense of almost everyone else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wonder if someday people will look at IP legislation of late 20th and early 21st century the way we see now tax on windows (not to be confused with windows tax, which opens gates to completely different discussion).

   &lt;p&gt;
    This year’s first snow fell couple of days ago and while I enjoy it immensely, I’m getting more and more annoyed by our snowplowers.
    &lt;a class="imageR" href="/images/firstsnow.jpg"&gt;
     &lt;img alt="First snow" src="/images/firstsnow_small.jpg"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Snowplowing in Slovenia is a state provided service without any business competition and like most such services it sucks. In fact, we relive the same story every year:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     some time in the fall there’s a story published, how everyone is ready for snow this year and there won’t be any problems with our roads
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     we get a correct weather forecast a few days before the first snow
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     snow falls, plowers are nowhere to be seen and there’s a complete mayhem on slovenian roads
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     snowplowers provide some meaningless statistics about resources used and journalists write stories about how they were surprised by the snow
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now, could you treat your customers and users like this? Probably not.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Except if you, like them, are the only provider of vital service. It’s probably still a poor business strategy because even if you are, like telecoms used to be, can you be absolutely sure that this will remain so?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I’d just like to know how is it possible fo them not to be embarrassed infront of their family and friends.

    I’ve been a netizen since ’93 and I saw web for the first time in ’94, when a friend showed me
    &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;
     Yahoo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I felt dizzy just thinking about possibilities.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I had no idea what was coming, but even though web came a long way since then, I never felt so excited again up until now. It’s hard to predict future and I avoid revealing my stupidity if possible, but it really looks like a no-brainer predicting a vastly different, more open and collaborative web in few years time than we have now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Feeds were a big step forward. It wasn’t necessary to scrap pages to reuse information anymore. Even more importantly, feeds changed the attitude so sharing and reusing content is now again a normal and good thing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems
    &lt;a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html"&gt;
     atom publishing protocol
    &lt;/a&gt;
    will soon be ratified and with it a standard way of editing web resources. In fact making sharing a two-way street. The final piece was provided by
    &lt;a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/PersonalSpace.aspx?_c01_blogpart=blogmgmt&amp;amp;_c=blogpart" title="Ozzie's blog"&gt;
     Ray Ozzie
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and guys at Microsoft. A synchronization protocol for RSS feeds called
    &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/" title="Protocol specification"&gt;
     SSE
    &lt;/a&gt;
    published under creative commons license that should be really useful for synchronizing calendars, contacts etc.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve read it a couple of days ago and I couldn’t find an obvious defect in it (apart from a small error in the example at point 2.2.2, which I’m sure has been spotted since). Truth be told, I didn’t expect it to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a simple, easy to understand specification. I wish people would stop using date-time values conforming to RFC 822, but nevertheless SSE shouldn’t be difficult to implement.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It probably really is the easiest thing that could work and it’s up to programmers to show if it might be too easy. There’s always a tension between things you specify and things you leave to implementation. Freedom given can and usually is a point of misunderstandings and until there are enough implementations in the wild, it’s hard to judge the quality of compromise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I won’t be surprised though if final specification version won’t be significantly different than current one. I’ll try to make our implementation as soon as possible and hopefully by that time there will be others to test it with.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’m not sure if there’s still a custom in our primary schools to go on a few days long school trip at the end of last year. I know there used to be one when I was there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We went to
    &lt;a href="http://www.tz-vis.hr/"&gt;
     Vis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a small and beautiful island in Croatia, which back then was still in the same country. It was the end of May, when sea is still very cold, at least if you’re not used to that sort of temperatures. We weren’t  and were basically stuck for a few days in a small village with nothing to do. That was back in the days, when there was no gameboys, portable DVD’s or whatever entertains kids today. However there was an ice cream parlor, where a scoop of ice cream costed only 1000 DIN compared to 2500 DIN back home.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So for three days my friends and I were regularly visiting that shop, buying copious amounts of ice cream. I haven’t spent even 1 DIN on it back home, because I thought it was too expensive. I spent more than 100 000 there, because it was so ridiculously cheap and I wasn’t alone doing it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lucky for me I didn’t get a bellyache, but I did get a lesson on how cheaper pricing doesn’t necessarily equate smaller profits. Odd that music industry still
    &lt;a href="http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=145210" title="Article about possible iTunes price hike"&gt;

    We use
    &lt;a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/" title="MoinMoin's homepage"&gt;
     MoinMoin
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for all our documentation needs, since it simplifies almost all related tasks. It’s nice when everything is available at one place through a familiar and easy to use interface.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is why I also wanted to use it to build a FAQ for our site, which is more needed with each day. There’s an abundance of software for building and managing such documents, but I haven’t found anything that would match our needs. Apart from using wiki pages as the source of wisdom, I also wanted:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     A good and fairly easy integration with our site (but not automatic).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     A very malleable solution, where it would be easy to change FAQ organization as requirements change.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end I decided to build our own thing using
    &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/index.html"&gt;
     Beautiful Soup
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a python package I raved about a while ago. Since we wanted each question to have a permanent link that could be bookmarked, we had to give them an identifier that wouldn’t change even if we rephrased the question or changed the answer. The simplest way was to assign a unique number to each question as it can be seen on a
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/samplefaq/faq.html"&gt;
     sample FAQ page
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . This way it’s easy to add and remove questions as long as you can count.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    MoinMoin produces very sensible HTML that is easy to work with.
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/samplefaq/faq.py"&gt;
     Here’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a proof of concept module that extracts information from a page like the sample one and packs it in a dictionary with identifiers as keys and a list
    &lt;em&gt;
     [ question, answer ]
    &lt;/em&gt;
    as value.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not something very useful on its own, but I think it’s a nice example of what can be done quickly with existing tools like MoinMoin and BeautifulSoup.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Notes: In principle there’s no need to use MoinMoin as long as produced HTML fits following assumptions:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     FAQ is stored inside a
     &lt;em&gt;
      div
     &lt;/em&gt;
     element with
     &lt;em&gt;
      id
     &lt;/em&gt;
     set to
     &lt;em&gt;
      content
     &lt;/em&gt;
     .
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Questions are inside a heading element which also acts as a delimiter between them.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Identifiers are integers.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If it doesn’t, you’ll need to change code a bit.

    To me the most annoying business habit is calling someone when it’s not urgent, even though you have his email address and it should be obvious from your relationship that he prefers email to other means of communication.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I hated phones since I was a wee lad, but I dislike them even more now, because:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     They break my concentration; rarely for a good reason.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

    blog. I don’t know much about their service, but I really like how logo gives you a direct clue to where you’ll go when you hover over it. It’s little things like this that make good interfaces great.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand I’m not fond of alpha or beta signs on services that are not finished yet. It’s been my experience that most users, especially more inexperienced ones, have no idea what that was supposed to mean.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why we went with
    &lt;strong&gt;
     “v pripravi”
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    stamp on
    &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si"&gt;
     our site
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is a short slovene description that we’re still preparing this yet unfinished site. It’s been very well received even though stamp doesn’t look real and doesn’t fit the rest of design all that well either. I believe the importance of language used can’t be overstated and jargon that you don’t share with your users must simply be completely avoided.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By the way, for those who’ve seen Marela, the reason why there’s a mismatch between the stamp (together with the first page) and otherwise great design is that former was done by me and later by immensely talented guys at
    &lt;a href="http://www.clearleft.com/"&gt;
     clear:left

     “Considering the exclusive right to invention as given not of natural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thomas Jefferson, 1813
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Guardian published a well written
    &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1646125,00.html"&gt;
     article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about intellectual property and ownership of ideas. I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, as I’m certain other entrepreneurs often do. Especially those with companies where assets are mainly good people you work with and intangible stuff like software. And ideas, which many think should be owned and protected.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve never been one of them, but I understand that patents are a complex enough subject which is difficult to explore and where policy has been based mainly on personal beliefs of people involved in creating it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As Jefferson has already said, exclusive right to invention is not a natural right, but a right given for the benefit of society. So, are patents still benefiting society at large? Would we stop innovating without patents, as some suggest?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t want to repeat ideas and arguments stated so many times by people more eloquent than me. However, I’d like to make a simple reasoning on what patents mean and what we could expect if there weren’t any.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe there’s an agreement from all sides that a patent was supposed to protect an invention from competitors for a limited amount of time. It should prevent others from profiting on it and therefore makes it easier to do so for inventor. This means a patent’s exclusivity reduces pressure from competition and therefore somewhat reduces competitiveness of environment for the inventor.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Thus abolishing all patents would lead to an extremely competitive environment. How would companies and any would-be entrepreneurs react to a world like this?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a world, where there’s no shortage of people willing and able to manufacture products at costs far below of those achievable in Europe or USA, it’s inevitable to keep producing new ideas if you want to differentiate yourself. Not inventing is simply not an option as long as you’re willing to compete.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There always were and always will be those willing to compete, if window of opportunity between invention and its replication by competitors is large enough to recoup investment and making a profit. A canonical example of industry like this is a software industry, where it’s fairly cheap to develop new stuff. No need for patents there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, in industries where that window is too small, there simply won’t be an industry if it’s either not made bigger or the investment made cheaper. Canonical example for this is pharmaceutical industry, where window is enlarged with patents and investments are cheapened by governmental grants.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hence question evolves to what kind of future is coming. Will most new stuff require long and expensive development cycle or will it keep getting shorter and cheaper?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My bet is on cheaper and shorter. Not only because we can see this already happening, but also because there’s every reason to believe this trend will continue for foreseeable future. Hardware is getting more generic and differentiation is moving to embedded software exactly because it’s faster and cheaper to develop. This is true for every product that has at least one button on it (mobiles, cars etc.) and even for a lot of those, that don’t (popular example being a modern hotel doorknob).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If this is how future will look like, then legislation should reflect that and patents should be limited only to design patents and to industries that genuinely need them or abolished completely and in certain cases replaced with already existing grants.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s a plethora of reasons I haven’t even touched, why modern intellectual property laws (and patent laws in particular) are hurting our society already. But I think what makes it even worse is that we are stubbornly marching in the wrong direction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Benefit of society, not personal or corporate gain is what this was supposed to be all about.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I spent a good part of last year studying things like marketing, pricing and so on, which are completely untechnical in nature, but very much essential for a success of any company. I’m far from being an expert in any of these fields, but every now and then I come across an example, that leaves me dumbfounded in its amazing stupidity. It seems like incompetence is limitless and some people receive quite a lot of money to show off theirs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Practically every textbook I’ve read taught me that the basic approach to marketing is to have a clear message of what you’re offering and why this is beneficial to people you’re selling to. With enough repetition you might have a chance of making them remember you. I certainly don’t think this is the only way to do it, but it’s probably the most tried and tested method out there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, there’s a new fashion in Slovenia. Create ads that don’t tell you anything. I’m not thinking of weird ads that don’t seem to have anything to do with a company or product they’re pushing. No, I mean ads with literally nothing on except a word like
    &lt;a href="http://www.izimobil.si"&gt;
     IZI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (bastardized easy) or
    &lt;a href="http://www.t-2.net"&gt;
     T-2
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I guess it might have been intriguing if it wasn’t so overused.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, last example with izi really takes the cake. First there were ads showing either just izi or if you were lucky, also a link to
    &lt;a href="http://www.naizi.si"&gt;
     naizi.si
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . As already mentioned, they were ads for
    &lt;a href="http://www.izimobil.si"&gt;
     izimobil
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Now, go look at the
    &lt;a href="http://www.naizi.si"&gt;
     site
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and find anything that could point a visitor to
    &lt;a href="http://www.izimobil.si"&gt;
     izimobil.si
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll buy you a beer, if you can do it in next 24 hours. Or any other beverage of your choice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Back? I couldn’t do it either. It’s hard to imagine there isn’t one, but it’s certainly well hidden. ’cause you know, people really want to dig around the site looking for what you’re about, right?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Their ad campaign has been expanded in last day or so as they came out with jumbo ads promoting izimobil more directly and they’re trying to do so with a slogan:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     “Prvi slovenski virtualni operater mobilne telefonije.”
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or in English:
    &lt;strong&gt;
     “First slovenian virtual mobile operator.”
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Say what?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Was that supposed to persuade me to do something? Does virtual mean they’re not real? Which part should register as something positive with me?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Apart from being almost meaningless, it’s also wrong, if being virtual alludes to using some
    &lt;a href="http://www.mobitel.si"&gt;
     other company’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    mobile network.
    &lt;a href="http://www.debitel.si/"&gt;
     Debitel
    &lt;/a&gt;
    did it first, although not as a prepaid operator and I know of no one, who would find that fact alone appealing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not saying their ad campaign won’t have positive effects. Hell, you can get them by showing dancing bananas and pie fights, as long as you’re willing to spend enough money on it. But somehow I doubt it’s an economical way to market your product.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    After a bit less than a month, but enough traffic to give me an idea what to expect, I decided to remove Google ads. I earned a dollar. Well, almost anyway.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My decision to end it was made easier when I discovered this, where ads were supposed to be:
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" title="Full size screenshot of search ads"&gt;
     &lt;img alt="Search ads?" height="65" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" style="border: thin solid #666; margin: 5px;" width="370"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Wtf?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tried to follow Google’s advice. I picked the most successful formats (but also experimented with others), put them at premium places and choose colors that blend in. Result was a buck and a revelation that on my site even old-fashion banners would be more profitable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have no real explanation for disappointing results. Since I’m not fond of ads either, I stayed with number of ad boxes I felt most comfortable with (usually just one) and used only text ads. It’s possible that I’d have more luck with image ads, but it doesn’t really matter, since I dislike them enough that they wouldn’t be acceptable anyway.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s also possible and even probable, that the problem was with content of pages. I’ve certainly noticed what often seemed at best a poor match between displayed content and ads.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sadly there weren’t enough clicks to merit a more involved analysis. Maybe some other time, when I have a new idea worth exploring and get better results.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Ever since I created my first blog, comment spam was an ever present evil. I can imagine it must be really annoying on very popular blogs with lots of comments, but the variety I have is more puzzling than anything else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What’s the purpose of producing spam comments that can’t pass even a simple filter included in default installation of WordPress?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I find it highly incredible that someone would be competent enough to write a spamming software and incompetent enough to avoid the only trap WordPress presents. Or is there a benefit to blog spam no one else but me sees?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are other problems with it that make it easy to recognize and handle it. I’m grateful, because I don’t have to annoy anyone with captchas or other comment preventing mechanisms.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A few years ago, before terrorism became an important and everyday topic, I was visiting a good friend of mine at Cambridge, who was doing his PhD there. He got a scholarship from a fund with Prince of Wales as a patron or something of the sort. I can’t remember the details anymore. Anyhow, he (and lots of other postgraduate students) got an invitation to a dinner with Prince Charles.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was staying at his place and he didn’t feel like going, so he came up with a marvelous idea. I should go pretending to be him. It’s not like he knew anyone, who’d be there. Since I didn’t have a suit with me, I borrowed a wool jumper, aiming for a sort of modest, academic look, which is the sort of idiotic notion you get by watching too many movies. It was also the only preparation we did.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I ended in a room (5 x 5 meters) filled with people in suits, whose idea of mingling is talking about their thesis and mentors.  Two pieces of easily obtainable information that I didn’t have. So I’ve spent the most adrenaline filled 4 hours of my life waiting for dinner and trying to hide my wool jumper covered ass from police and anyone who could uncover me (a lot of people as I’ve found out). I had no idea it would be so difficult to avoid talking to anybody.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s amazing what you can get away with if no one expects you to be that daft. At the end I didn’t have to find out if police would believe my story and I discovered that, if I may be immodest for a moment, a sum of two highly intelligent people can be a cretin.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, what does this little story tell us about group intelligence?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Absolutely nothing. I was just dying for an opportunity to share it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand, folksonomies, wikis and most of what is these days disgustingly known as Web 2.0 do. Even though I think open formats and uninhibited access to own data should be a basic right and largely form Marela’s raison d’être, I believe in the long run it’s social part of “new” web that will prove to be really revolutionary.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nothing exemplifies this more than
    &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;
     Wikipedia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and its sister sites. It’s exploding popularity is shocking on many levels and although most articles seem to focus on its growth and statistical data, it is relation to facts and truth that most interest me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Critics of Wikipedia often point out sample articles of dubious quality; premise being you can’t actually know which articles to trust and which not. But it’s really the
    &lt;a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/29/wikipedia_reputation_and_the_wemedia_project.php"&gt;
     supporters
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , who I think are even more misguided.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Critics are not wrong. It simply doesn’t matter they are right, because we don’t care about veracity all that much. Authority is very much dead.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Web hasn’t made us critical thinkers. We don’t actually question information we find, unless we disagree with it. If anything, then first ten years of web made us more sloppy, more willing to believe unchecked statements.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Paradoxically I think it’s this naïvety that was and probably still is needed for Wikipedia’s development. It simply wouldn’t grow to its current size without satisfied readers, who are in effect a form of payment for voluntary work. Without users I doubt it would ever gather critical mass to evolve perception that you can contribute even if your knowledge might be lacking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For all its faults, Wikipedia still is a huge body of knowledge that greatly exceeds what was available to most of us not so long ago. It’s an amazing achievement and web is markedly different place now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After a good year of using different services I’m amazed how well simple things, which at first seemed like interesting toys, work to capture group intelligence. Tags proved to be simple, flexible way for organizing and finding things and I believe tag clouds will in future be used even more for capturing zeitgeist. I’m sure we’ll get more tools and learn to use better those we already have.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They are not perfect but as with Wikipedia, it doesn’t really matter, because they don’t have to be. They don’t have to give perfect answers as long as they avoid giving really bad ones. Rare are occasions in life where we’d prefer a perfect, but long coming answer over a good enough, yet a quick one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course there are exceptions, where group intelligence fails and we need an authoritative answer. New tools won’t replace old ones and neither will groups be only source of wisdom. But they won’t go away and I’d advise against ignoring them.

    Wednesday’s conversation with
    &lt;a href="http://www.friedcellcollective.net/"&gt;
     Fry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    provoked me to think more about where and when to use AJAX. I thought I’ve got it figured it out, but I’ve discovered that my opinions don’t really match my behavior and I find this a problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    AJAX rage of 2005 hasn’t brought many articles exploring benefits and downsides to AJAX. There were few, even very good ones, but I’d like to see more of them and less articles describing latest gimmick or service which would probably be overlooked if it didn’t use an AJAX trick or two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I had a dentist appointment today, something I’m sure everyone looks forward to, which at least provided me with ample time to think about this. My basic premise was that we should use technology that already works and use AJAX to build on top of that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since basic web model has been around for a long time, is well understood and mostly works, I tried to look at places where it doesn’t or at least not as it should and came to a short list of possible criteria for choosing when to apply AJAX:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Browsers ought to support this, but mostly can’t or don’t.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Example: autosave support for textarea, which is the most requested feature among my friends.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Browsers support it, but badly.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Example: progress bar for uploads. I don’t know why you can get a usable dialog for downloads, but you’re out of luck if you want to upload.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Connection problems (narrow bandwidth or high latency).
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     If this is a known, but otherwise unsolvable problem, AJAX can be used to reduce ammount and frequency of traffic.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Have I forgot anything else?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t think these are only valid scenarios for AJAX use, but we did discover that fast serving of well designed pages greatly reduces the need for AJAX.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    One of the downsides of running your own company is that you have to get familiar with things you could never care for and amazingly often make sense only to really twisted bureaucratic minds.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    In Slovenia, if you collect personal information of any kind, you have to register such database 15 days before its first use with
    &lt;a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/index.php?id=2243&amp;amp;L=1"&gt;
     Inspectorate for Personal Data Protection
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m all in favor of laws protecting personal information and in general I think Slovenian laws are not too bad in that regard. But if inspectorate by their
    &lt;a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/porocila/poroc_ivop_2004.pdf"&gt;
     own words
    &lt;/a&gt;
    rarely inspects cases that weren’t reported to them and all such inspections seem to be limited to state institutions, what good is such register than anyway? How does it protect anyone?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can read online
    &lt;a href="http://www2.gov.si/mp/katalogz.nsf/(wwwUpravljavci)?OpenView&amp;amp;Count=30" title="Online register"&gt;
     a list
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of companies that registered their databases together with a short summary of what kind of data they collect and what for. I’ve checked a company where I administered such database for two and a half years (never experienced an inspection of any kind) and it’s quite clear that no one actually checks if provided information is true or complete.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What you’re left with is another meaningless obligation you have to fulfill. Preferably by sending them email with data AND a printed form (email only is not allowed). Nice. You can do more work so they don’t have to.

    It seems like ages ago, but it’s really been less than a decade since I was busy being a localization lead of
    &lt;a href="http://www.lugos.si" title="Link to slovenian Linux user group"&gt;
     slovenian Linux user group
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . There was a lot to be done and I had great plans how to achieve it with few of us working on it. If only we’d execute my plans timely and precisely, we could make a mini computer revolution in Slovenia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

     “A mind of a soldier and a heart of a poet.???
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to believe this old description of me from an Indonesian friend was simply a compliment. I haven’t recognize then how wonderfully he had praised and berated me at the same time. And rightfully so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I hadn’t grasped then is that setting the rules, making plans and pushing people to do what you think is the right thing to do in general doesn’t achieve much. Lucky for me — and for others — I’ve left after I’ve done my part and hopefully before I prevented others to do theirs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve learned through the years — and spending so much time designing things certainly helped me with that — how subtle changes can have big consequences.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I won’t pretend I know why and how to fix it. There are certainly wiser and more informed people than me trying to do that and little would be gained by me joining them. But ever since I’ve read
    &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/cahill/index.html" title="Thomas Cahill's home page"&gt;

      How the Irish Saved Civilization

    &lt;/span&gt;
    , one image has stuck in my mind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Thousands of hungry “barbarians??? waiting for Rhein to freeze so they could risk (and awfully many lose) their lives to enter Roman empire. Not to end it, which eventually they did or to become romans, as many tribes before them. They just didn’t want to be hungry anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And on the other side you had a nation too self-absorbed and still proud of their civility and achievements, unable to fathom the fragility of their great civilization,  unable to see imminent end to 12 centuries old empire and rule of law.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s hard for me as european and history buff to not see similarities between then and now and it’s even harder to believe that problem can be solved by simply not letting people in. Like that was ever possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What is really bad is not that some of us have too much, but that too many have too little. Or nothing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I remember when towers fell in New York. I remember my anger at USA, a country I’ve never been to, and the feeling of injustice, of not being heard or simply being ignored. I wish I didn’t and I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, but is this the anger painfully felt in France?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We were cooking miso soup today, a dish my wife and I both love and I was thinking about Japan while doing it. I’ve always been fascinated by Japan and its culture and even though I’ve spent a great effort and a lot of time studying it, it was obvious today that my wife is a much better cook and that I haven’t got a clue about the land of rising sun.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tried to remember what I was taught in school about it. Or about any other place outside of Europe. It wasn’t nothing. In fact it was quite a lot, especially for time allotted to it. Time — that is — which wasn’t spent learning about history of Europe and even more of our nation in it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But it’s been clear where the focus was and I don’t think our history lessons are in approach much different from history lessons elsewhere. Simply by choosing the focus of lessons we subtly  or even not so subtly show what’s important and build patriots. So far a sense of a nation seems to be the only way of maintaining a state longer than a few decades.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the same time we guarantee and promote ignorance that clearly doesn’t help us and which leaves people like me with profound sadness and too many unanswered questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When I started this blog, it was my intention to create a place, where I could share little knowledge that I have as a developer and I intend to continue doing this in the future. But it became obvious today that I’ll be able to do so only after I’ve written this post, no matter how unheard and insignificant it is. I at least have a way and opportunity to speak up.

    I’ve just noticed that a lot more time has passed than planned since my last post about Linux. I wanted to write a follow up to installation post a week later, but it completely slipped my mind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a few weeks now and my Linux box has become the place, where I do most of my work. There are three reasons for this:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     kioslaves like fish let me work with remote filesystems over various protocols as if they were local
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     abundance of tabs which can be navigated with keyboard (terminal, editor and browser all support them)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     bookmarks in file dialogs even for remote filesystems make using even a complicated directory layouts a joy
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are other things I really like, but it’s really hard to live without those three. The only thing really ruining my happiness is a sucky USB keyboard. So far I had no luck with finding a reasonable replacement.

    I’ve been looking for Javascript localization resources on Google and came up fairly empty handed. There seems to be
    &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MultilingualWebsites3.asp#4"&gt;
     little
    &lt;/a&gt;
    useful information and even less useful code. The only thing I found, that is actually usable, is a
    &lt;a href="http://johnnydebris.net/javascripts/i18n.js?frames=no" title="Link to javascript i18n library"&gt;
     library
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Guido Wesdorp.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find this utterly amazing after a decade of Javascript being in wide use, although I probably shouldn’t be. A likely explanation for this is that Javascript is most often used for short scripts inside web pages. If used on a multilingual website, it’s usually fairly easy to have separate javascript files for each language.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I expect this will change with rise of more complicated, involved web applications. However, so far AJAX toolkits that seem to spring up these days like mushrooms after rain, have been busy with obviously more important things like animations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I could be wrong. In fact, I hope I’m wrong. Is there a javascript i18n library with following characteristics:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     easy to use
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     supports translation of javascript code and HTML
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     small and relatively fast
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     translations are separated from HTML and javascript code
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     handles properly nodes with superfluous whitespace and those where it can’t be collapsed
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     supports translation of nodes with other HTML tags as ancestors (not only text nodes)
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Guido’s library is a good tool that meets many of these needs, but sadly not all of them. Writing my own one seems to be the only solution.

    I’ve spent this evening building RSS2 and Atom feeds with
    &lt;a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html"&gt;
     PyRSS2Gen
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href="http://kid.lesscode.org/index.html"&gt;
     kid
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://www.defuze.org/oss/atomixlib/"&gt;
     atomixlib
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , as
    &lt;a href="searching-for-atom-feed-generator.html"&gt;
     proposed
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by helpful people few days ago.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’d like to add feeds promiscuously to our service (right now we have exactly one). But before we can decide how to tackle this, we need to know how fast we can generate a feed on average.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     DISCLAIMER: I tried to generate feeds with same data using what seemed a reasonable python code to do so, but I didn’t try to save every millisecond as I only cared about crude speed approximations. I have no problem believing that someone else might get completely different results. No serious statistical analysis has been made and rigorous scientific approach has been almost completely absent. Better make your own tests, if speed (or anything else really) is important to you. But if dubious numbers delight you, then please continue.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, here are my results. Time to generate a feed with 10 entries on 1GHz G4 Powerbook:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     with PyRSS2Gen somewhere around 70ms
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     with atomixlib around 120-140ms
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     and with kid around 30-35ms
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In other words, you can generate between 8 and 30 feeds per second on my notebook and (I guess) 2-3x as many on a modern server. This is more than enough for most cases, but I’m afraid it probably won’t be enough for us. Which means either producing feeds by gluing strings together or having a more intelligent approach than building a new one on every request.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a side note, I found all three packages easy to work with.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     Update: Sylvain has released atomixlib 0.3 which makes it even easier to create atom feeds and brings also significant speed improvements. On my computer it takes now around 60-65ms to build a feed.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another update: I made a couple of quick tests with mixed results on fairly new Opteron server. PyRSS2Gen was actually slower with 80-85ms and I have no idea why. kid was blazing fast with times between 8 and 9ms.  Definitely good enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But I couldn’t get atomixlib to work, because 4Suite failed to build, so it will have to wait until I can figure out why it chokes on a perfectly legitimate XSLT.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Update 3: 4Suite has been promptly fixed (thanks!) and atomixlib 0.3 takes now 18-19ms. I believe this is an excellent time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/friendship-and-hand-holding.html"&gt;
     discussion
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about friendliness of communities.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My personal experience with Python community has been absolutely wonderful. I’ve written
    &lt;a href="no-language-feature-is-optional.html"&gt;
     posts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that could be seen as inflammatory, but the response I’ve got was just amazing. I haven’t been nailed to the cross for it and have learned a lot from people I admire, who took the time to leave a comment on my blog for which I’m really grateful. A couple of days ago I
    &lt;a href="searching-for-atom-feed-generator.html"&gt;
     needed help
    &lt;/a&gt;
    developing atom feeds and got it immediately.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find Python community very friendly and forthcoming, but I also believe Ian is right that Ruby might feel more friendly simply because a kind of youthful innocence. I wouldn’t really know, since I don’t use the language or follow up their discussions. I have however experienced in other communities the problem of a disconnect between old timers and newer members, who don’t share cultural history just yet. I think this is inevitable, since experience unlike knowledge can’t be easily given.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand, I have a different problem with web related talks we’re organizing. It’s been our goal from the start to use talks as a conduit for slovenian web community building, which hasn’t happened to the extent I was hoping for. Our talks are well attended, but at the end our audience mostly leaves, which kind of saddens me. I’d like to get them more engaged, but I have no idea if the problem lies with us, organizers, or is just a result of slovenian culture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess community building is just hard.

    In last couple of weeks I’ve begin to notice that ever larger part of my visitors are coming to my site through search engines, most of them from Google. I seem to be the most unsatisfied WordPress user or at least the loudest of the lot. I find Google’s ranking algorithms highly perplexing and therefore extremely interesting. So far the only thing I learned about them is that I haven’t got a clue.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve added Google ads to this blog a couple of days ago. A move, which unsurprisingly didn’t lead to instant riches and a life of a professional writer and won’t do so anytime soon. But I am learning and when I’ll have enough data for an actually meaningful statistical analysis, I might even write a word or two about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course lack of data doesn’t stop me from thinking about it and the question that’s been on my mind these last few days is, does showing Google ads influence your page rank in their search engine?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let me be clear upfront. I don’t think it does and also have absolutely no reason to think otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But opportunity is there. Obviously it doesn’t make sense for Google to promote websites solely because they show their ads. Bad search results would lead to exodus of their users to other search engines fairly quickly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, let us imagine a scenario where we have two websites with the same calculated rank for a given query. One has Google ads and the other doesn’t. There’s obvious benefit of favoring the one with ads, but the risk of doing so is probably quite small. After all, they have the same rank.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Google favors “their” websites in situations like this and truthfully, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it.

    My blog has become one of many showing ads from Google. As many have said it before me, I did this mainly to learn more about them and their effectiveness. Honest. Volume of traffic on this site is simply too low to expect more money than maybe, just maybe enough to buy a CD every few months or so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The fact is that we’re thinking about ad based business models (not for this blog, but the service that’s coming up really soon now), but we lack experience with click-through based models and I believe this site might be a good enough test case to learn more about them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have a request for you. I’m not looking for sympathy clicks and would really appreciate it, if all clicks were generated because of your personal interest in presented offers. I might earn more otherwise, but I won’t learn what I want.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Thank you.

    I get a feeling sometimes, that most blogs are an outlet for people to complain about something. I know I do it more often than I’d like to. I’ll do it less, but this post is another rant.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lately, whenever I read or hear anyone mentioning Apple, my blood starts boiling. Reason for this is quite simple; today is a two-month anniversary since I took my broken iMac to local Apple service and it’s also the day when they let me know, they got another broken motherboard from Apple so they can’t tell me when they’ll be able to fix it. But they can give me my money back.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be awful even if this was the only time I ever had a problem with Apple. Sadly it isn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can understand that every manufacturing line produces a certain percentage of faulty products. I might accept, unwillingly,  that Apple products on whole fail less often than competition and that it’s just my bad luck that got me a faulty computer. But this hardly matters, if you have no real idea when they’ll be fixed, when they actually do break.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it’s far better for me, as a user, to have a product that fails twice as often, but which can be and more importantly, will be fixed in a couple of days, then something that presumably almost never fails, but when it does, it might take an unspecified number of months before you’ll get it fixed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, I’m quite certain I won’t be buying anything hardware related from Apple anytime soon. I have to decide if this includes getting rid of this iMac or not. Getting rid of it means I’ll probably won’t get my data back and I certainly won’t finish a couple of projects.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other dilemma is what to say, when friends ask me about Apple products, which every now and then they do. I had a good experience with my local Apple reseller (more or less Apple only shop)  and would like to recommend them, but it’s impossible for me to recommend products they are selling. Truth may set me free.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wish Linux had a better video and photo editing software. It’s the only area I can think of where it doesn’t actually exceed my expectations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    I’ve been sporadically using
    &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/"&gt;
     Flock
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for last two days and it’s an interesting take on a modern browser and social computing. Two features that I found most useful are bookmarks (or favorites, as flock calls them) integration with
    &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;
     del.icio.us
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and history index. Especially the last one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Flock indexes every downloaded page, so when you start typing a query in search window, it presents a list of matches from your history. Everytime I try to find a page in my browser history, I find myself amazed at how many pages I read every day.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s one of those in hindsight obvious features that I hope, expect really, to see in other browsers fairly soon. It’s just makes sense.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s less obvious how you make money with software that you can’t charge for. Opera demonstrated (and Flock intends to
    &lt;a href="http://www.decrem.com/bart/2005/10/creating-sustainable-value/" title="Description of Flock's business model"&gt;
     follow
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) there are other business models that work at least for now. I hope it’ll also work for Flock.

    I finally got a new machine yesterday and I immediately installed SuSE 10 on it. Ubuntu seems to be the flavor of the moment, but I was never much fond of Debian and even less of GNOME.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So far I really like the experience, the only exception being a problem with a keyboard. For some unknown reason my old PS/2 keyboard doesn’t get recognized in Linux and therefore simply doesn’t work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s the first time in almost a decade of being a Linux user to experience something like this and I have no idea what could cause this and how to fix it. Google hasn’t helped either, so if anyone has any idea about this, I’d be immensely grateful if you could share it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m using an USB keyboard for now, which works. Well, sort of. It seems to be impossible to buy a decent USB keyboard in Slovenia so I’m stuck with

    I’m not ashamed to admit, although I maybe should be, that Thursday evenings are reserved for TV. I’m a sucker for good detective series and it’s then when most of them are on. I haven’t really noticed until recently how important a theme song is to set the mood and I got to think more about it yesterday, while watching CSI: NY (by the way, CSI: Miami is just crap and should be scrapped).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Shouldn’t every website and program have its own soundtrack?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not talking about annoying
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_music"&gt;
     muzak
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of flash intros. I despise them as much as the next person and much good would be done if they all disappeared tomorrow. I’m thinking of soundtracks more as a development tool. When we are building stuff (websites, programs or whatever), we try to imagine things like who our typical user will be and what kind of mood or feeling are we trying to provoke, which is not always easy. It’s easy to create a bland descriptions alright, but I find them of limited help when trying to really imagine, to connect with what they’ll experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We all listen to music that talks to us. And it also talks about us. Isn’t it sometimes just easier to describe what we are trying to do with a song or two?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we did that, what would happen when listening to them while using the website?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think a good website would blend with a soundtrack previously made to capture its emotional experience. If it doesn’t, then there’s a problem and if I’m sure that soundtrack is just right, then I should change my website until I don’t feel a dichotomy anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     Jeremy Keith
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has written a response. This is just the lastest, but certainly not last exchange on this topic and I think we’ll continue to talk about it for some time to come.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think I find myself somewhere in the  middle. Part of our service follows Jeremy’s school of thought and part of it is firmly on Justin’s side. I think Jeremy’s argument that the problem is due lack of planning is just wrong. I spent literally months contemplating and trying different things before I finally accepted that not everything can be done in nicely degradable manner without making sacrifices.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or to use a misplaced example. You can start with a bicycle that more or less everyone can use and try to add features, that will enable it to go faster and with less physical strain, but you’ll never produce a
    &lt;a href="http://www.ducati.com" title="Ducati motorbikes"&gt;
     Ducati
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . At most you’ll finish with something like:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.ebikeshop.co.uk/detailscruiser.html"&gt;
     &lt;img alt="Electric bicycle" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/ebike.jpg" style="width:190px;height:186px;border: 0;"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I’m not saying electric bike is bad. In fact it has many features that Ducati will never have. They are just different and what’s better depends on what you want and who you want to serve.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe the same applies to Javascript degradation. You have to decide what you’re building and for whom. When developing our service, I probably haven’t thought about anything more than this issue and the choices I made were certainly not done lightly. I did discover a simple question, that often makes such decisions easier:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     “Would anyone ever want to bookmark this?”
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If yes, then degradable javascript is the only acceptable solution. If no, then there MIGHT be a case for non-degradable solution, but it certainly doesn’t immediately justify it.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     tema ima vsaj opazno povezavo s spletom

    Vse ostalo je prepuš??eno vam.

   &lt;p&gt;
    Vsa mnenja so dobrodošla, še posebej pa predlogi predavanj (prosim navedite pri??akovano dolžino predstavitve). ?e vam ni vše?? naslov, predlagajte novega. Nove predloge za naslov sre??anja zbiram v komentarjih, predloge za predavanja pa lahko pošljete TUDI na

    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Rok za oddajo idej je 1. november. KPT?Ž bo, ??e bom takrat imel vsaj za 45 minut predstavitev in ne bo o??itnega upora sami ideji. V nasprotnem primeru bomo leto zaklju??ili kot ponavadi; z odli??nim predavateljem in debato, ki ponavadi sledi predavanjem.

    Another Wednesday, another talk. I was sorry not to see more visitors, but I guess we have ourselves to blame. Talk would certainly benefit from a better description, but it is a topic that I find interesting, yet hard to describe. The running joke of evening was that we should prefix all talk titles with PHP to lure all those developers who seem to respond mainly to known keywords. It’s a shame that curiosity is such a rare trait after a certain age.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    . As fate would have it, he’s also father of RSS.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And it’s RSS that I was thinking about later on, when I was contemplating the role of microformats on web. First version of RSS came out some 8 years ago and it wasn’t until last year or two that feeds gained enough traction to actually become relevant. Still, most web users have no idea what they are and I believe really interesting uses of feeds are still to be seen.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also believe the same is true for microformats. We are at the start of the road and we are yet to see really interesting stuff. I think there’s a definite need and opportunity to describe information on web in ways more suitable for further use.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’ve been thinking about Python’s global interpreter lock (GIL) again. Since I’m a glutton for punishment and haven’t been crucified in a week, you get to hear about it too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Has anybody thought and wrote about avoiding GIL until you need it? What I mean is creating and using GIL only when you start using code that might not be thread-safe.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, what’s wrong with this idea?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Things that come to my mind:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     garbage collector is not thread-safe
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     majority of interesting modules are not thread-safe, so there would be little ROI
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     dynamic nature of Python means you can’t know in advance if you’ll need GIL and it would a bitch to fall back when you do

    I think HTML forms  are probably the least well designed part of X/HTML specifications and at least
    &lt;a href="http://www.whatwg.org/" title="Link to WHATWG"&gt;
     some people
    &lt;/a&gt;
    agree. They were fine when they came out, but time has moved on and form elements just didn’t follow. There are too many things wrong with them, but personally I mostly miss a good control for date handling and a slider.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So
    &lt;a href="/examples/slider/index.html" title="Slider example"&gt;
     here’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    my take on a slider, implemented with javascript. You can also download this example packed in
    &lt;a href="/examples/slider.zip"&gt;
     a zip
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It works at least in all major browsers, but I don’t consider it finished. However, since I haven’t found the time to finish it and I don’t think I will any time soon, I’ve decided to publish it anyway. It may be useful to somebody.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s fairly easy to use, if you can live with its limitations. You can create a horizontal or vertical slider. I believe example is self-explanatory, but if you find it difficult to use, please let me know and I’ll help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Couple of things to remember. Code expects to find an image of button in subdirectory
    &lt;em&gt;
     img
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and it shouldn’t be bigger than this one. If you need a different size, just correct javascript.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Also
    &lt;em&gt;
     addEvent
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     delEvent
    &lt;/em&gt;
    functions in
    &lt;em&gt;
     slider.js
    &lt;/em&gt;
    should be replaced with something more robust, when
    &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/" title="PPK's blog"&gt;
     ppk’s
    &lt;/a&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I think our first talk was a success. It certainly exceeded my expectations and I hope that most of those who were there feel the same. I was happy to see that a lot of us didn’t just leave, but stayed to enjoy conversation with other visitors. I hope this will become even more common and expected.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I got a chance to talk to several people I wanted to meet or whom haven’t seen in a long time and I immensely enjoyed myself. Our conversations covered many topic, one of which was
    &lt;a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/"&gt;
     WordPress
    &lt;/a&gt;
    where I made some statements that on reflection probably deserve an explanation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I said that WordPress sucks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is not true and I don’t actually mean it, but it is as true as what
    &lt;a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/"&gt;
     wordpress.org
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has to say about its product:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I use WordPress, but I can’t say I enjoy the experience. It’s certainly not worse than most similar stuff out there, but I think best have moved on. I don’t find default installation particularly pleasant to look at, its usability is questionable and in an age of WYSIWYG editors and online spell checkers, it’s hardly state-of-the-art either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s still a good software and I wouldn’t nag, if the page didn’t also say:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your blogging software, not fight it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now that is pure crap. It would take too long to list everything I believe they got wrong, so I’ll concentrate on a couple of issues to illustrate my frustrations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are things that are plain stupid. Theme editor tells me I could edit my template directly, if I made files writable. True, and I wouldn’t be the only person who could do that anymore. So you have a theme editor that is either useless or a security problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And then there are things like user levels. As an administrator of WordPress you have to decide what level a user should be, but there’s not even a word of explanation in user interface about what that means. No hint, nothing. Sure, it’s explained in wordpress documentation, but is there a link to contextual help available on that screen? To any help whatsoever? No.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s stuff like this that makes me think WordPress has a long way to go for an average user.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A while ago I agreed to organizing a series of talks about web and web technologies. They were and will be the cause for occasional outburst of Slovene on this blog. As Slovene speaking readers already know, the first one will be tomorrow at 19.00 in
    &lt;a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org"&gt;
     Cyberpipe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is a rather cool place I almost never visit, because I’m weird and don’t like it all that much. But if you’re into net art, free wifi, cyber cafe and like meeting like-minded people, than it’s the place for you in Ljubljana.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I agreed to a job with no salary, fame or groupies and I did it whorishly quickly, because I thought it would be really cool to get Slovenian web community be, well, more communal. A better thinker than me would certainly notice that I’m not actually necessary for this plan to work and so could leave this task to someone else. But I’m as much a sucker for leaving my mark and doing it my way as any dog out there. Or better a cat. Yes, definitely a cat. Tomcat that is.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, here we are, on the eve of first talk, which I’m certain will be a great (success) as all others will be and I’m working on November’s and December’s schedule, which are not coming together as easily as I’ve hoped. Series is aimed at experienced part of community and there are awfully lot of Wednesdays for something as small as
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia"&gt;
     Slovenia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I mean 20 thousand square kilometers and 2 million people. If any smaller it wouldn’t be a country, it would be a city.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore I’m asking both of my readers which option is least annoying:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Forget a regular schedule. Have a talk when you can, but let it be worthwhile.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Have a regular schedule, but keep it regular with more basic talks (e.g. how to build your first web page).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Have a regular schedule, but keep it regular by having regular speakers.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like variety, even in food, although between you and me, I could eat pasta every day. I’d prefer to have as many different speakers as possible, but I’d rather listen to the same lot (if good) then nobody or even worse, to talks I can’t care about anymore. How about you?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    P.S: If there’s anyone that would like to give a talk and is willing to come to Cyberpipe, please let me know. Reasonable costs of transportation can be reimbursed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A few days ago I
    &lt;a href="scaling-image-buttons.html" title="Previous post on this topic"&gt;
     wrote
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about a difficult goal of having a pleasantly looking submit button that is also as accessible as possible. I also had a simple
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/imgbutton/index.html"&gt;
     demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that almost worked, but not quite.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I played with it a bit more and actually got it working as far as I imagined I could. You can see the result
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/imgbutton2/index.html" title="New demo"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (just change the size of fonts).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I did is set base font size in all browsers to a known value as described by
    &lt;a href="http://www.clagnut.com/blog/348/" title="link to description on Clagnut blog"&gt;
     Richard
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It isn’t really necessary to use 62.5%, but it does reset initial size to 10 pixels, which is a value that is easy to work with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then I just set height of an image button to its real size, but using em’s instead of pixels. In my case that’s 25 px or 2.5 em’s.  I also set font-size of input button to 1 em, which for some reason is needed in browsers other than Safari, to enforce 10px size for fonts and 25px height for the button.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s it. Button is now resizable and has its original size by default.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Solution, which is entirely CSS based, is not perfect and I don’t believe it will ever be. Or at least not using incarnations of XHTML and CSS that we have now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As can be clearly seen on the demo, it all comes down to a choice between better legibility of scaled
    &lt;em&gt;
     type=submit
    &lt;/em&gt;
    buttons and more flexible design of
    &lt;em&gt;
     type=image
    &lt;/em&gt;
    buttons.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I imagine I could do better with multiple sizes of an image for each button and using javascript swapping, but it wouldn’t work where javascript is missing and multiple images would significantly add to production costs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I think web sites should have a design readable for vast majority of its readers even without text scaling and this trick can be good enough for the rest. However, at the same time I don’t expect to use it often.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’ve slept only a few hours today, to wake up early and drive in awful rain to Koper.
    &lt;a alt="Tim's page" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/"&gt;
     Tim Bray
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was speaking at
    &lt;a alt="Conference's page" href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/ooocon2005/"&gt;
     OOoCon 2005
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I didn’t want to miss it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Tim Bray" class="imgleft" height="160" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/bray.jpg" width="150"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wasn’t disappointed. He’s an excellent speaker and even though I can’t say I’m a dedicated user of any office suite, I found his talk very engaging and thought provoking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As every WordPress user knows, blogging interfaces can be rather underwhelming.  And WordPress is just an example, as the same can be said about most of them. But users are certainly not getting help from current versions of suites. Sad state of Blogger plugin for Word only exemplifies that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore OpenOffice of the future should recognize the rising popularity of blogs, wikis and personal voice on the web and do for them what yesterdays suites did for business communication (forgetting downsides for a moment). Making personal publishing less painful and more flexible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If I understood Tim correctly, he wants to go even beyond that and imagines a world where OpenDocument is a sort of an HTML of tomorrow. Meaning it’s an open container for our data, that would get used by a different applications in myriad of ways, but would never lock our data in.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been looking at Atom and its publishing protocol lately and just thinking about it and about Tim’s talk, makes my head go dizzy from all the possibilities.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sometimes, I really am an idiot. A couple of years ago I was involved in development of a front-end Zope application for a major Slovenian ISP with more than 100 000 users. No matter what we did, Zope just wasn’t fast. In fact it was so slow, it was soon abandoned for one more suitable solution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The failure of our project was largely my fault, because I haven’t made sure Zope was a good fit for what we wanted. I learned a lot, but it also left a bitter aftertaste and a question, why are people using it?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The obvious answer is of course, because it DOES fit their needs. It’s just that they are not building a site or an application that needs to handle few hundred simultaneous requests. They handle a few at most, so Zope or Plone or what-have-you is more than speedy enough and it’s their features that count.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It really took me awhile to grasp this and it only became really clear this week, after reading a little
    &lt;a href="http://www.larsen-b.com/Article/217.html"&gt;
     Plone benchmark
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and having a discussion with
    &lt;a href="http://seba.antiwisdom.com" title="Sebastjan's blog"&gt;
     Sebastjan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about slowness of Slovenian sites.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On a positive note, we generate pages in less than 6 ms now and can reduce it even further, if needed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s one thing that really bothers me, when it comes to design of forms. Well, more than one really, but let’s limit this discussion to just one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Submit buttons.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t stand their look, especially geek chic design of early nineties presented in Firefox and its relatives. I guess industrial look and Motif widgets were never really my taste. But even more pleasant design of buttons in Safari can look out of place with some designs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s also an alternative that is often used. Image input buttons (type=image) can provide a more pleasant look, but they have one big disadvantage compared to submit buttons. They don’t scale. Not really something I’d want in an accessible interface.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used a hardly novel
    &lt;a href="http://clagnut.com/sandbox/imagetest/" title="Clagnut's image tests"&gt;
     idea
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of defining image measurements in relative units. Browsers usually don’t do this. They lay it out in original size using absolute values. Hence, when you change the size of fonts, the size of image stays the same. But if you use relative units, you get desired scaling effect. It might look like crap, but at least it can be readable for people with impaired vision.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As you can see in simple
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/imgbutton/index.html"&gt;
     demo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , experiments with em’s haven’t worked really well. There are two distinct problems. First is to find the relative size that doesn’t stretch an image in either direction. Second, to do this in a cross-browser compatible way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My demo kind of works in Safari, but not really in Firefox and I have no idea about rest of the bunch. So, has anyone solved this problem?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update: I managed to get a better result. You can read about it

    Why is it that we still celebrate national sport teams as demigods and cheer a bunch of guys (or gals) only because they come from the right part of a planet?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Slovenia was caught in a basketball euphoria when it looked for a while that it might actually win a medal. Personally, I have no beef with people playing it. I haven’t done it in a while, but I used to enjoy it a lot. I don’t mind people watching basketball or any other sport either. I rarely do, but I do recognize inherent drama and sometimes amazing display of mastery.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also don’t mind cheering in general. We’ve all encountered individuals or teams, who exemplified rare qualities we admire and wished them best luck. I do find it a bit repulsive to cheer for a person or a team just because they come from the right town or a country.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems rather primitive to pick a side mainly because of nationality or locality; as if our nationality is itself a quality worthy of admiration and pride. They are our lot, our tribe, and that makes them better?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Is it then a wonder that after all this time and relative progress we still have so much troubles with each other? If intimate human relationships can’t survive feelings of personal superiority, how can it ever happen with nations?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve always been attached to this place where I grew up and culture that shaped me to who I am today and I can’t imagine giving it up. But long gone are days when I felt the same about my nationality and I’d be ashamed if they came back.

    I was reading Roger Johansson’s blog and came to a
    &lt;a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/"&gt;
     post
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting"&gt;
     top-posting
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     &amp;gt; Because it messes up the flow of reading.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Why is replying about quotations annoying?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Could you please stop with that? I don’t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it’s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn’t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
     &lt;list&gt;
      archives proves this.
     &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     It’s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it’s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can’t be a reason to howl down somebody.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don’t think I’m a lesser being for it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Until recently I’ve been using Python 2.3.x almost exclusively and I thought it was about time I get more familiar with what 2.4 series has to offer. I’ve skimmed the list of new features when point zero version came out and found some things that I like (e.g sets) and some that I disliked (e.g. decorators).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this time I invested a bit more time to actually read and understand what was on offer and how these features came about. I still haven’t found a need or a sympathy for decorators, although I can see why some people want them. Personally, I believe they’ll more likely be a cause for less readable and harder to understand Python code than they prove to be useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still think Python is a wonderful language, but gone are the days when I was looking forward to each release and goodness it brought. These days I’m afraid to look and discover another feature that helps more with keeping habits from other languages than adding something new and genuinely useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like minimalism in all things and therefore see every new feature as a burden that should be more than offset by its usefulness. I’m not a language designer and hence can’t really say or tell if Python is going down the wrong track, but there is something that I find most annoying.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about languages quite a lot recently; how we use and abuse them and what impact our language proficiency has on our communications. There’s one thing I find very different with programming languages than those used for normal human interaction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s very little optional about them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It really gets my goat when a language feature is defended as being optional. You may have a choice in using a feature, but you certainly don’t get a choice in learning and understanding its use. Even if you don’t use it yourself, you’ll quite likely have to interact with somebody else’s code, which does and unlike with English, it’s not enough to just get a sense of meaning from its context. You actually have to really understand what it does and hence need to be familiar with feature itself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It might still be worthwhile to add it, but let’s not pretend when we do that it’s completely optional.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    P.S: Isn’t it amazing that after all these years, we still have a global interpreter lock? Wouldn’t it be better if we worked on removing that disgrace?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I thought Harold Evans’
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language"&gt;
     last column
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was quite good.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s no shocking revelation that I’m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I’d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I’ve used for more than three decades.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I’m sure I still make mistakes like this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there’s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you’re talking about and not well enough to actually do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Play with fire and you’ll get burned.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve just spent two days hunting a bug that just didn’t make sense. No matter what I did, there was at least one browser, which didn’t want to behave properly and it was driving me nuts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Finally I gave up and decided there’s nothing wrong with my code and the fault must be with the browser. And so it was, up to a point. Or not, depending on your point of view.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem was a timing conflict resulting from a use of
    &lt;a href="framestack-technique-and-accessibility.html" title="Description of technique"&gt;
     framestack technique
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and the way modern browsers work. Browsers don’t wait for the whole page with its data to load, before they display it to users. They display as reasonable presentation of received data as possible while they are trying to load the rest. For example, onload handler set to body tag is triggered when body of HTML document has loaded, but possibly before images and other external resources have. When they do, page layout might change somewhat and if your script is reading and using layout data in the meantime, it’s quite likely it’ll end up using wrong values.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The easiest (and right) way to fix this is to start javascript with
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.onload
    &lt;/em&gt;
    , which is triggered when everything has loaded. This might be a problem, if you’re using something like framestack to avoid reloading page on subsequent visits, but at least in my case I’ve decided that the cleanest and easiest solution was to use window.onload and just force reload of problematic page on each visit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s also possible to get in similar timing conflicts by using
    &lt;em&gt;
     innerHTML
    &lt;/em&gt;
    method. If you try to stuck a large piece of HTML inside a page using innerHTML call, you may encounter an unwelcome surprise. Reason for this is that at least some browsers don’t wait to parse and insert data in DOM before they proceed to the next statement. Injection delay is usually barely noticeable, but big enough for statements that manipulate inserted data to fail, if they are in close proximity to innerHTML call.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can’t necessarily avoid innerHTML problems with window.onload, but you can by using (more cumbersome) DOM methods.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It still annoys me though that I knew all of this and wasted two days just because I didn’t think of it.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is the second post on this subject. You can find the first part
    &lt;a href="latency-bandwidth-and-speed-of-applications-part-i.html" title="First par of this article"&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, how do latency and bandwidth relate to the speed of execution?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As mentioned, latency is time needed for any amount of information to travel a certain distance and bandwidth is the amount of data that can flow through it at the same time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let me give you a real-life example. If you imagine people walking down the corridor, then latency is amount of time one person needs to walk from start to its end and bandwidth is number of people who can do this at the same time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can measure latency quite easily with ping, a tool available on every major OS, which will give you a round-trip time from client to server (2+5 from our original 7 intervals). The only problem is that it will tell you just your personal latency at that time, which can vary significantly for people on different networks and even for you at different times. There are similar tools for measuring bandwidth and they have more or less the same problems.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, sometimes you can tell a bit about what you can expect. For example, if you’re building an application aimed at mobile users using GPRS, then it’s quite reasonable to assume that bandwidth will be scarce and latency will be high. On local networks it’s usually the opposite of that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In general, latency rises with distance between server and client and bandwidth can’t be wider than the narrowest bandwidth on the way and the question is how do we react to our situation?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Basic rules are:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     if latency is high, then we should make as few round-trips to server as possible
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     if bandwidth is wide, then we can transfer more data at each trip
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In practice we should always try for the most balanced approach between this two factors. If latency is fairly high, but bandwidth is not severely limited, then we might transfer also data we don’t need immediately, if it might spare us another request later on. If latency is low and bandwidth is narrow, then it might make more sense to transfer only what’s needed, but make those requests more often.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another way we can sometimes cut down response time, when bandwidth is not the limiting factor, is to multiplex connections, which is a bit fancy way of saying to simultaneously open multiple connections from client to server. It’s nice to keep in mind that some browsers like Internet Explorer will limit number of simultaneous connections for HTTP protocol to 4 (as specified by its standard), but you are more free to do what you want, if you write your own program. It’s also nice to keep in mind that if order in which responses are coming is important, you’ll have to handle that yourself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A different approach is to simulate multiplex connections over one connection. In this case client sends multiple commands inside of one network request and receives answers to all of them at once. It’s easier to handle order, since you get all data at the same time, but you give up possibly faster response for some of the data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are other factors that can influence our decisions, such as possibly increased load on server from more requests. Or the speed with which we can generate a request and process reply, if we need to pack and unpack more data. But this are issues worth exploring in some other post, if interest justifies it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Latency, bandwidth and speed of applications - part I</title><link href="/latency-bandwidth-and-speed-of-applications-part-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2005-09-14T21:10:00+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:,2005-09-14:latency-bandwidth-and-speed-of-applications-part-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems we’re back to discussing the importance of bandwidth and latency on perceived speed of application. In a way it’s amazing that after 10 years of widespread use of Internet and local networks, we developers still discuss these issues.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, what contributes to speed of execution in network applications?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Each network request can be divided into seven time intervals:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     time needed to send a request
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     latency, which is time spent for any amount of data to travel between client and server
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     data transfer time
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     time needed to process a request, form a response and send it
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     latency again, but this time in other direction
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     data transfer time for response
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     time needed to process response and present result to user
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sum of all these parts is time lapsed between issued command and presented result. How fast this needs to be depends on application and our experiences. For example, we expect faster response to our key presses in SSH client than we do waiting for search results.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, if this sum is under a quarter of a second, it will be generally regarded as instantaneous, but you really should aim for 1/10th of a second to satisfy even the most twitchy users.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Usually, we might get to control all parts of this equation only when client and server are located on a local network and we develop both of them. So, a well behaving application needs to take in account environment in which it will run and act accordingly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This means, among other things, to give user feedback that something is happening whenever there is even a remote chance that response might take a while, to react sensibly to network disruptions (such as timeouts) and offer a way to abort user actions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, how do we speed up the application itself?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Absolutely the best way to speed up a network request is to not make one. The usual way to do this is to cache result over its life span and use it when possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other way, lately often mentioned in relation to AJAX, is to make our requests asynchronously. Unlike synchronous requests, which are direct results of user actions, asynchronous are those were data is transfered in expectation of future user actions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    An example would be a mail program where we transfer message headers of yet unread mail in background before we actually need to display them to user, since it’s fairly likely that he’ll want to check them in near future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are also downsides to this approach. It can be difficult to predict what to transfer next if no user action is more probable than rest. It can also incur significant costs if bandwidth is expensive as often is on GPRS networks in Europe. And when number of simultaneous connections is limited (HTTP allows 4, but not all browsers comply), it can occupy a resource when you need one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, it’s a useful tool when it can be applied.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     &amp;lt;span class="change"&amp;gt;billg at microsoft dot com&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    with
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;lt;a href="mailto:billg@microsoft.com"&amp;gt;billg@microsoft.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are few caveats to its use. You’re not allowed to use any HTML tag inside of span blocks, which have class set to change. The script also expects such blocks to have only one class definition. If change is only part of class attribute value, this script won’t work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You are free to use script as you please and to make any changes necessary. But if you choose to replace “at” and “dot” as delimiters, pick replacements that make address easily recognizable for those who don’t use javascript.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Note: The reason why this script works is that spammers use programs which search for email like pattern in page. They don’t interpret pages using javascript interpreter, since it would make collecting addresses significantly slower and more expensive.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update: Jay Samec let me know there’s a bug in my code, since it didn’t handle emails with multiple dots (e.g. those with subdomains). Script has been fixed now.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update 2: Holger Rindermann pointed out another bug and provided a patch to fix it that is now a part of the script.
    &lt;/em&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been a Python programmer for more than 6 years now and during most of this time it’s been the language I used professionally. It’s safe to say, I know it fairly well and I’m quite attached to it. I also have to admit that I can’t stand Twisted and Zope.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a continuous wonder for me, why Python community chooses to promote projects that feel most unpythonic to me. I became addicted to Python, because it was a very simple, yet expressive language which lived up to its mantra of making easy things easy and hard things possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what is actually easy with Twisted and Zope? Practically nothing. At least not as long as you don’t dedicate yourself to their use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You see, Twisted and Zope are not products. They are religions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They were not built in a way that would make it easy to integrate them with wonderful things others built. It’s not easy to just pick the parts you like and use them elsewhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No, like a good disciple you were supposed to study the way they work, use their new vocabulary and dedicate yourself to live within confines of chosen religion. If you do this, then you’ll get some payoff and you might after a while even think you enjoy it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But you’ll be missing on a hell of a lot of stuff others made and you’ll have to live with limitations of not your choosing. Well, at least not completely.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess I wouldn’t find it so distressing, if I didn’t feel Python developers are getting too eager to add new features to please Zope and Twisted developers. Or features that were inspired by these two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So this language I loved is with each new release becoming ever less clean and beautiful and it’s getting easier and easier to imagine a day, when I’ll switch to some other language as my main development tool.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Disclaimer: When I talked about Zope, I actually meant version 2.x, because it was the one I actually used on a project and left me scared badly enough that I can’t make myself to even check X3. I heard it’s better in many regards, but I really don’t care anymore.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also think developers who created Zope and Twisted are amazing. I just think that their product is, well, unpleasant.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    I’ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I’ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it’s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Customer relationship management.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you’re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I’m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There’s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn’t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it’s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Why is this so hard for others to learn?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By the way, if you need to buy computer hardware and you want to get a good price with as little fuss as possible, please let me know and I’ll send you his email address.

   &lt;p&gt;
    This is probably the last part in series of post dealing with Beautiful Soup. At least for a while. Good news is, I found the bug that caused observed weird behavior and it was partly self-inflicted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My problem appeared, because I was using variables that resembled html tags (e.g. imgs, ul…) and didn’t put space after &amp;lt; in statements as good practice dictates. So I  had statements like:
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     if (i&amp;lt;imgs.length)
     &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Beautiful Soup relies on
    &lt;em&gt;
     sgmllib.py
    &lt;/em&gt;
    for processing of documents and it’s sgmllib that causes havoc by processing CDATA (found in script and style blocks), when it shouldn’t. But the problem is not really with sgmllib, which has a literal switch to turn processing off. It’s just that Beautiful Soup doesn’t use it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So fix is really adding one line
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
     &lt;br/&gt;
     self.literal = 1
     &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    after
    &lt;em&gt;
     if
    &lt;/em&gt;
    statement on line 835. Or
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/BeautifulSoup.py" title="Link to fixed version"&gt;
     downloading fixed version
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Reading source I also realized another potential pitfall. If you use javascript to inject javascript with document.write method, you’ll probably confuse sgmllib (and hence Beautiful Soup). When processing CDATA, it doesn’t try to understand it, it just copies data until it finds an endtag (&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; in javascript’s case). But if you’re doing that, you have yourself to blame.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     BeautifulSoup 2.1.1 is
     &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/index.html"&gt;
      out
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , which fixes my bug and several others. So you better fetch that version.
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems I praised Beautiful Soup too quickly. I was playing with it yesterday and discovered it mangles Javascript included in file. I can’t say it does this every time, but it’s fairly obvious if you have few kilobytes of code stuck in file. There you have it, another argument why Javascript and CSS should be stored in external files.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s not an option for me though, so I’ll have to work around it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s still a great module, as long as you can work within its limitations, but it’s not panacea. At least not yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If I find time, I’ll try to fix the problem, since I really dislike idea of processing files using usual methods (regular expressions &amp;amp; co.).
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    We’ve been working with a talented group of designers, whose work I admired for a long time, on a design for our new service. Initial concept was exactly what we were looking for and the only changes that needed to be made, were consequences of our bad choices earlier on. In fact, everything was great except one thing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We didn’t like proposed color schemes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Every time I work with a designer, I’m afraid I’ll have to say that. It’s probably the most common complaint they hear and I really hate to join this particular crowd. Sure, they’ve always been graceful (at least the good designers), but I’m certain they wouldn’t mind spiking a voodoo doll of me, given a chance.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That got me thinking, is there a specific, but very common complaint for every trade out there? I couldn’t recall one for programmers, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. I certainly would love to hear your experiences.

    So, I’ve been working on this project for some time now, where I’d take user supplied HTML templates and transformed them into new templates, that our system can actually use.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I needed to mangle and change them, but I also didn’t want to require from users things like well-formedness and other stuff that makes sense only to web developers (and sadly not even to all of them). Mainly, I want this stuff to be used by everyone, even those with retarded web editors and if it’s good enough to be displayed in their browsers, it ought to be good enough for me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This decision was made a lot easier, when I discovered
    &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/index.html" title="Homepage of Beautiful Soup python module"&gt;
     Beautiful Soup
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s a python module that makes  screen-scraping much easier, but what is even more cool, is that it makes changing documents, even those with bad markup, extremely easy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are a python developer, who needs to extract information from or possibly change documents with bad markup, this is the module to use. It will save you time, keep you sane and make you rich. Well, two out of three ain’t bad either.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    So, Google
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/talk"&gt;
     has an IM
    &lt;/a&gt;
    now. Nice that they are using Jabber, but it would be even nicer if their server talked to others too. Otherwise this is just another walled garden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    True, there’s an offer to federate with others, but this makes as much sense as having connection agreements between email servers. If they want a really open IM, then they should let their server work as Jabber was designed. Everyone can play and set up their own server.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On a different note, does anyone know of a good open source Jabber server that can actually handle 10k simultaneous connections and doesn’t go crazy every now and then?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update: According to
     &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249"&gt;
      Joe Beda
     &lt;/a&gt;
     there are 3 reasons for staying close:
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Missing code needed for interoperability.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     They want to develop abuse/spam countermeasures.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     They want to ensure everybody really talks to everybody.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can certainly sympathize with first reason, if true (and I have no reason to doubt it). But it’s harder to agree with other two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You already have a contact authorization to limit such behavior. If this is not enough, the correct way would be to be as open as a lot of Jabber servers are and switch on protective measures after you’ve developed them together with Jabber community.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It also shouldn’t be up to Google to dictate how open other providers should be. That decision should be left with administrators of Jabber servers and they shouldn’t be coerced into Google’s policy. Basically they should keep the same freedom email server administrators enjoy right now.
    &lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’ve been working on our project for a very long time and it’s been clear all along, that our site, when it’s finally revealed, will look and act very similar to what is already out there, although in a different language and with many, sometimes subtle, differences.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, should I feel offended or be afraid, as has been suggested by some, of being accused of plagiarism? Or more importantly, should I make a special effort to be different?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t think so. When revealed, site will indeed be very similar to its inspiration. I don’t expect this will last long and I think in few months it will be clear that we took a different approach, but at least at first, it will look like a little brother of some other well known website. I already talked about this and there’s little sense in doing it again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Real question therefore is, how valuable and important is originality or when is it important to be original?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it’s important to try to build something better than what is already out there. This may not be always completely true. E.g. it might be sensible to build a localized copy of established global service to bring it to people who would otherwise be kept away because of a language barrier.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I find this kind of development doesn’t contribute much to my personal happiness and is hence not really something I’d like to pursue in the future. But I also don’t value difference just for the difference sake. I think if something works well and I’m not able to significantly improve on it, there’s no good reason to build something else just to be original.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe almost every web retailer’s website looks more or less like a copy of Amazon, because their design works well. It also means less of learning curve for new visitors, which is a nice thing as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what do I do?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If something works well, I’ll use it. If it doesn’t, look at how I could improve it. But before I actually do anything, is the difference big enough to bother actually creating it?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    It has dawned on me recently, that I’m not using Linux as much as I used to. True, all my servers are Linux based and all new code is eventually deployed on them, but I haven’t been using it for a while on a desktop.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Probably the main cause for this was my Powerbook, where practically everything I create starts its life. It’s just so much easier to carry all your work with you. Linux cause also wasn’t helped by a fact, that my PC is incredibly loud and makes air in office unbreathable in a matter of minutes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mac OS X was never a perfect match for me and I always missed some things like true network transparency. But lately I became tired of various software bugs and hardware troubles that plague me and started to think about Linux more. I also miss being part of open source community.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, after this pre-launch mayhem is over, I’ll look for a new Linux machine. It’s time to go home.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s a small quirk that developers hit now and then when they are processing a list of elements returned by getElementsByTagName function.  Usual, but still unexpected behavior is that not all elements of the list have been processed and if you are using javascript console, it might complain that there’s no element in the list at index, where you’re certain it should be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The reason for this is that returned list of elements is not really a list. It’s a live view of matching elements. If you delete one of them in document, it will be removed from the list as well. List will become shorter and some elements in it may change their position to fill empty slot formerly occupied by deleted element.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore, if you loop through such a list and its possible that you might remove current element, it’s best to loop from last element to the first. This keeps positions stable and predictable even when you delete.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It can be a bit trickier to handle if you add matching elements inside such loop. Sadly there’s no easy solution that would work all the time and you have to take in account your situation.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’m usually quite fond of weekends. There’s never a good reason for it, since they’ve looked like normal working days for quite some months now. But the feeling of a time off still lingers and I’m usually happy when it’s Friday.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m also quite happy that there are only few more hours of this hellish weekend, when nothing went right. Among other things, I got so exhausted  that I slept straight for almost 12 hours (personal record) and I got acquainted really well with spinning wheel on my Powerbook. Probable cause: dying disk at time when that’s least needed. One more thing made by Apple (beside iMac and iPod) that I need to take to service when I get around to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, not much work has been done in last few days and I won’t be able to finish even what I promised to do.  This never fails to annoy me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have been thinking, while strolling around lake,  about when to reveal our very buzzword compliant service to the greater public. Is the right time when it’s finally useful, but still obviously inspired by other services found on web or is it better to wait half a year or so,  when it will gain the really interesting parts?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still think the right time is this autumn, even though this will lead to accusations of plagiarism. At this point they won’t be really unfounded even if I believe we are just borrowing ideas from others to build something interesting and different (hopefully somebody will someday return the compliment).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, it would be good  to see how others react to what we build and to fix things now  when this can be done more easily then if we wait longer. I also learned the importance of releasing things to keep developers motivated and at least somewhat happy. Nobody likes to be completely irrelevant.  At last, there’s also the ever present problem of money.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If anybody actually gets around to reading this, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this subject. What do you prefer, big bang revelation or evolution of service?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    When I started my company with a friend two years ago, I had many plans for it and myself. One of them was to make interesting, innovative stuff. Hard problems others weren’t tackling or we thought we could do better.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A year and a half ago we started to work on what is slowly, but clearly becoming Marela (which should see light of the day this autumn). It’s interesting how you start working on one clear idea and with each week that passes, your idea and your view change a bit until after a while, they are very much different from what you set out to do. Same passions, same goals, but quite a different result.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What really changed in last year is what I personally want to do. I’d still like to do things that nobody has done yet, but more important now is to take ideas from others and try to make them more accessible, easier to comprehend and use. I’ve noticed that most of my innovating these days, as much as it happens, is directed toward these goals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lately I’ve been having awful time using stuff made by Apple. Ipod refuses to wake up from sleep without reboot, Powerbook added broken Superdrive to random freezes and new iMac seems to find ever new ways to annoy me. So I’ve spent a good amount of time last week to recover pictures from last vacation and fix other random iPhoto quirks and while I was doing that, a wonderful thing happened.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Something shifted in my head and for a while I could see clearly how computers look to people, who unlike me haven’t spent a better part of two decades behind a keyboard, but use them with the same understanding and confidence as I can use lathe.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    God, it’s awful how much crap we produced and still produce. I’ve never seen so much wisdom in Jacob Nielsen’s words as in those moments. Gray backgrounds with blue links and black text might be dull, but you certainly don’t have to guess a lot on what to click after you’ve seen one such page.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Luckily the insight isn’t completely gone, but I wish I’d keep more of it. I’m not saying we should abandon everything and return to bleak past, especially since the problem is self correcting one, but I do feel impelled to make my work more accessible to more people.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a way, I think there’s a dilemma of who you want to reach. I believe younger generations don’t and won’t have problems with most of the things designers and programmers come up since computers and technology have always been a large part of their lives. However, in general, it’s a bigger problem for those, who haven’t picked up idioms of computer user interfaces young enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I think making things easier for later makes it easier for former too and therefore a reasonable goal to pursue.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    Back from Ireland, a place everyone should visit at least once. If you have time, take a few days to explore Dublin and travel to west coast. Those like me, who find abundance of national pride and flags creepy, might skip Northern Ireland.

    I still haven’t managed to write my promised or planned articles, including framestack technique, but I’m still optimistic to finish them before the end of month. Well, sort of anyway, since time is not on my side.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The thing that probably hit me most at @media was accessibility and issues surrounding it. I’m still one of those evil people, pushing Javascript too far. But hey, I do care and I’m trying to find good, accessible solutions for what I’m building and failing behind schedule as result. Not far enough to worry yet though.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems same thing is on other people’s minds as well and they wrote a lot of good stuff about it.

   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’d just like to add a word or two about situation in Slovenia, where to the best of my knowledge we don’t have such legislation and almost nobody cares about it. What I found encouraging in London was the number of people who cared and I believe legislation has played a part in making people notice.

    and
    &lt;a href="http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/"&gt;
     Derek
    &lt;/a&gt;
    at javascript get-together and they certainly convinced me that I could and should do more to make my web applications accessible. However after a few days of thinking, I still have issues that seem to lack a good solution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First of them is
    &lt;em&gt;
     window.onload
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .  Ppk already
    &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/11_june_london.html"&gt;
     explained
    &lt;/a&gt;
    the problem quite well. There’s also a workaround, which I admit I’m using right now, and that is to have an inline event handler on body tag.  There are only two problems with this approach:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     inline event handlers are even more despised than inline CSS styles
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     we are mixing XHTML/HTML with Javascript, which is a no-no as well
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     it doesn’t really work if you don’t have at least a simple function to check and handle, if external javascript code has been loaded yet
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I think all points make a lot of sense when not taken to extreme. I sincerely doubt that webpage/application suffers a lot, if this is the only inline event handler in the whole document and inlined code in head is kept to minimum. We often use CSS to add behavior (a:hover), where it just makes sense and I think we should be able to use inline Javascript on occasions as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In my case, I’m living in a country, where majority of users are still on a dial-up and most of them will stay there for a while. Since parts of my application can fetch 20 or more 5-10K sized images on a single page, I don’t want to force users to wait 20 seconds or more before application starts to behave reasonably. I also can’t rely on x/html layer behavior because of framestack javascript technique and their problems, about which I plan to write more in the following few days.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The only other alternative I see right now is to hide UI by default and display it using Javascript, which is hardly an improvement. If anything, it’s a step back.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess I’m in this mess because I didn’t build an html version first and upgraded it with Javascript. Why this happened and how come I don’t think it was necessarily a bad thing, is a topic for another day. But it certainly left me with a puzzle to solve.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, any ideas, apart from obvious one of having a working html version with added javascript?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/strong&gt;

    This is a first post on my new development oriented blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I returned from @media2005 yesterday, where I got the feeling that either you have a blog on which you share your thoughts and possible insights or you have no good way to join the discussion except few times a year on conferences like the last one, which certainly can’t be and isn’t enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore I decided to make a new start, this time in English and about subjects where I might have a bit more interesting things to say than what happened to my non-existant cat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, welcome to anyone who happened to come to this place and I hope you’ll find it at least mildly useful, if not entertaining.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
