  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining
    &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    . A must watch is

    on
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov"&gt;
     Vladislav Surkov
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I
    &lt;a href="40.html"&gt;
     became 40
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
    &lt;strong&gt;
     not
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"&gt;
     quantified self
    &lt;/a&gt;
    movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading"&gt;
     Again
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
     mjp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It
    &lt;em&gt;
     is
    &lt;/em&gt;
    something to keep an eye on this year.

   &lt;p&gt;
    As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don’t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best:

      Smut: Stories
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Alan Bennett. Sex is rarely as funny as in this two stories, but the second story kind of peters out as if the author ran out of ideas to resolve the twisted mess.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253/"&gt;
      Developing Backbone.js Applications

      Backbone.js Cookbook
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Vadim Mirgorod. A quick dive into Backbone.js best when paired with previous book on the topic.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Vagrants-Novel-Yiyun-Li/dp/0812973348"&gt;
       The Vagrants
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Yiyun Li.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can’t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp/dp/1482374811/"&gt;
      Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jeff Knupp. A short but informative collection of tips on how to write “pythonic” code. The only real downside is book’s price.

    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Andrew-Miller-ebook/dp/B0052RMN1U/"&gt;
      Pure
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Andrew Miller. Works best when establishing atmosphere of late 18th century Paris and easy engaging read that turned out to be a bit of disappointment for me. I wish author had as much courage as he does talent.

       Soldiers of Salamis
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Javier Cercas.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/"&gt;
      The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024"&gt;
       The Quiet American
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Graham Greene.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn’t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567"&gt;
     GEB
    &lt;/a&gt;
    even if I discover that I don’t like it.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now
    &lt;em&gt;
     know
    &lt;/em&gt;
    some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can’t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There’s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don’t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn’t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There’s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won’t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you
    &lt;em&gt;
     can
    &lt;/em&gt;
    do, better. Which is what I am doing now.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I meant more books from authors translated into English (so not “Anglo-saxon”). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less satisfying picks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus 7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they were easily exportable and creating them wasn’t such a hassle.

     I bought this book because I wanted to understand why some places in my neighborhood work so much better than others. The book is easy to read, short, but packed with useful information and I can’t recommend it enough.

      Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Karen M. Tracey. Book has some flaws: 50$ price on Amazon, sometimes too much details, obsolete Django 1.1. Nevertheless I would recommend it since it does provide a very good and mostly still relevant introduction to this topic.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      by Sándor Márai.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation (from Hungarian via German).

      The Misunderstanding
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Irene Nemirovsky. I completely disagree with the review on Amazon. This would be a very good book even if its author wasn’t 21 when she wrote it. Certainly not sentimental, but also not a overly judgemental look at life of a doomed affair.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     PADI Open Water Diver Manual by . Lots of good information, but poorly organized with bunch of infomercial crap at the back. Still much better than cretinous videos and definitely helps to pass the exam.

      Life of Pi
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Yann Martel. Read it after I accidentally saw the movie which I surprisingly (to me at least) liked  a lot. The book and the movie are really two takes on the same story, both standing on their own, but I liked the movie a bit better. The book is much darker and not for the squeamish.

     I bought this book after I’ve seen this remarkable play and it is equally impactful when “just” read. Can’t recommend strongly enough.

     by Mark Ethan Trostler. A book with (I think) slightly incorrect title. I wish ratio between explaining how to test Javascript and how to set up environment was more in favor of the former, but still good book to read on the subject.

      Books
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author’s view (which I do).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Raising Steam
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really like to build a couple of things I’ve been postponing for years now. Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A year that started with
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"&gt;
     Aaron Swartz’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    death and ended with
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela"&gt;
     Nelson Mandela’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at
    &lt;a href="http://aptivate.org/"&gt;
     Aptivate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra"&gt;
     Socotra
    &lt;/a&gt;
    sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur"&gt;
     my Github history
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trepca"&gt;
     Sebastjan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Instead of building tools like
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
     mjp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or
    &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet"&gt;
     image-diet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to
    &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"&gt;
     set things right
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I’ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#avoid-stupid-1-note" id="avoid-stupid-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Why am I trying to say this?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Is it a matter of a principle or degree?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#avoid-stupid-2-note" id="avoid-stupid-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
     .
    &lt;/sup&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Can I be persuaded?
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t always run through all these questions, but I’m sure I’m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regretfully I don’t have time to build this and it wouldn’t scale (I’m curious why Akismet doesn’t do something like that). So following Tomaž’s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don’t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn’t take more than a couple of weeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly Google Reader users or at least that’s how I imagined them. I certainly was.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Greader’s shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good time for late spring feed pruning.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the time it was up again, Greader wasn’t anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.

    So I am not much of a planner. I didn’t read tomes and I read few work related books, but on the other hand I really enjoyed most of those I did read. Still it seems to be a challenge for me to really dive into world literature. I purposefully slowed my reading in second half of the year with aim of getting work done which
    &lt;a href="2012-review.html"&gt;
     didn’t pan out
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that well either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I suspect I also didn’t read as many tech books as I wanted because I mostly buy them in electronic form and don’t enjoy reading books on computer screens including tablets. E-ink readers are nicer, but underpowered and have issues displaying code samples well. Postponing decision is not working out, but I’m not happy with existing choices. Not sure how this will be resolved or when.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Links in the list still point to Amazon, but without affiliate IDs and are as always present only for those that are at least fine. Bold is reserved for those I found best:
    &lt;em&gt;
     The White Tiger, Safe Area Goražde, Bright Earth, Next World Novella, Behind the Beautiful Forevers
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Sense of Ending
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . If you are a web front-end developer, then you should also look at
    &lt;em&gt;
     Undercover User Experience Design

       The White Tiger
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Aravind Adiga.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I bought this book by mistake and don’t regret it. An astonishing and brutal portrait of India’s underclass that grips you and doesn’t let go even after you finish its last page.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Experience-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321719905"&gt;
      Undercover User Experience Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Cennydd Bowles &amp;amp; James Box. Excellent guide on doing UX on the cheap that is also a good introduction to UX. There are few people who couldn’t learn something from this book.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Redbreast-Jo-Nesbo/dp/006113399X"&gt;
      The Redbreast
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jo Nesbø. Gripping enough if you don’t mind in-text ads for previous books or genre tropes. A good book for beach, if you are into that sort of thing. I don’t see myself reading another one from this series.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Joe Sacco.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Certainly one of the best graphic novels I’ve ever read which can teach something about conflict even those who have been following it closely. Deserves all awards it got.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-JavaScript-high-quality-applications-libraries/dp/1847194141/"&gt;
      Object-Oriented Javascript
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Stoyan Stefanov. An introduction book to Javascript (in browsers) best suited to programmers of other languages. Chapters about classes and inheritance are good reminders of less often used parts for intermediate Javascript developers.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      The Habit of Art
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Alan Bennett. Multi-layered drama with much humor. I saw its original production and I still think of it often.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140811514X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"&gt;
      The Stone
     &lt;/a&gt;

      In a Strange Room
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Damon Galgut. A book about traveling, un-articulated rootlessness and failed human connections that switches remarkably well between first-person and third-person narrator. It brought up some of my own almost forgotten memories and I would recommend it without hesitation.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375704027/"&gt;
      Norwegian Wood
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Haruki Murakami. I don’t really know what to think of this book. It’s well written, engaging and reading it I do not not feel like time was wasted. On the other hand I don’t see depth others see or a master writer others describe. Still not a bad book to pick up.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       Bright Earth
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Philip Ball.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     I bought this book after I heard his talk on the same subject but still missed that it is foremost about painting colors. It is an amazing book which has significantly changed my perception and understanding of paintings and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in colors or visual arts.
    &lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/"&gt;
      Venkatesh’s blog
     &lt;/a&gt;
     is among the most interesting ones I follow, but I was less impressed with this book on role of tempo in our lives and ways to work with it. There are certainly interesting ideas in it, but it often felt disconnected and too full of new jargon. I suspect I need to read it again with more focus and fewer interruptions.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Earth-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0062067753/"&gt;
      The Long Earth
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett &amp;amp; Stephen Baxter. The first book in upcoming trilogy. Fun to read and well thought through look at what could happen if we suddenly had infinite natural resources.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innumeracy-Mathematical-Illiteracy-Its-Consequences/dp/0809058405"&gt;
      Innumeracy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by John Allen Paulos. Easy and interesting read, but it’s not clear to me what the purpose of the book is. It’s unlikely to be read by those who need it most or offer much in ways of tools and techniques. It is more of a cautionary tale of mistakes and lament about state of affairs which is still the same.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     How to Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish without a Trace by Frank M. Ahearn &amp;amp; Eileen C. Horan. A warning book for those who are not particularly paranoid and less useful as a how-to. The rest of us largely won’t be surprised although you might find out a thing or two. I hated author’s voice.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Next-World-Novella-Matthias-Politycki/dp/0956284035"&gt;
       Next World Novella
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Matthias Politycki.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     A beautifully written multi-layered book about death, marriage, loneliness, memories… One of those rare books that not only can be re-read, but should be.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="https://smacss.com/"&gt;
      SMACSS
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jonathan Snook. A guide to writing modular CSS that should be easier to maintain and more reusable. A must read for web developers even if they don’t agree or use all described techniques.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553"&gt;
       Behind the Beautiful Forevers
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Katherine Boo.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     A devastating, uncompromising and well-researched look into life in an Indian slum. Together with White Tiger it significantly influenced and informed my view of India and I wholly recommend it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062009494"&gt;
      Dodger
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Terry Pratchett. An enjoyable and informative recreation of Victorian London with a story a bit too predictive, straight-forward and far fetched for adult readers. Read only if you’re Terry’s fan or not an adult.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Ending-Deckle-Vintage-International/dp/0307947726/"&gt;
       The Sense of an Ending
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Julian Barnes.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Opinions may vary, but I recommend it without reservations. Really well written and was able to evoke memories of my youth without really describing it. I enjoyed reading it till the surprising and devastating end. Doubtlessly I will read it again.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year? More useful education, more foreign literature and hopefully one or two longer ones that have been on the shelf for a while.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Happy and healthy new year!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mine started as it ended, in bed with a nasty cold. We were in one of few places in Slovenia where there was snow, great weather and I got to experience it all mostly through windows. In a way it was a perfect sum of last year: missed opportunities and unexpected disappointments, but at the same time actually quite good if looked at from a different perspective. 2012 was a year full of health scares, not all of which were resolved happily (so far). I certainly hope this year will be better for my loved ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I learned last year that I don’t miss Twitter. Occasionally I read
    &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/friedcell" title="Marko's Twitter account"&gt;
     Fry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ‘s stream, but otherwise end up there only by mistake. There’s still work to be done on how to manage empty distractions and I miss tools that would help me decide what to read and how much of it. Facebook account — also gone (I hope; who can really tell?). Rarely used, never missed and incompatible with my convictions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Digital sabbath continues to be a great idea and I can’t recommend it enough. Setting too ambitious personal goals…to be avoided. Explicit goals can lead to worse results when it becomes clear they can’t be met, even more so if they morph from a metric to a substitute of original purpose. Knowing this I nevertheless managed to become a textbook case of a goal-induced failure and will need to spend quite a bit of effort to get in a better shape. Need to keep focusing on whys too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Having a list of possible and finished projects on wall still frees my mind. I have just
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet" title="Image Diet - reduce size of images"&gt;
     released one
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of them, but it is obvious I haven’t really stayed the course this year, switching projects with predictable result of finishing few and losing a bet with
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trepca" title="Sebastjan's Twitter account"&gt;
     Sebastjan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . You could look at it as the most expensive dinner of my life (if valued by time spent) or a hell of a good investment in code I will use this year. I prefer the latter (and what kind of twat would object to paying friend’s dinner).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I actually did work on my personal research agenda in my spare time. I just don’t have enough of it and it is what I struggle with most. I found development proceeds more smoothly when done regularly, but to do that I need to maintain a very detailed to-do list which allows me to make a meaningful contribution even when there is only half an hour to spare. I have also added reminders to my calendar to regularly review (or re-awake) my work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I decided to stop using these end of year posts for commenting on  external developments. So far mostly impotent protests in Slovenia left a  bittersweet taste. I am curious what this year will bring, but these  reviews tended to be bleak and I’m not becoming an optimist.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am happier. It really is a privilege to, not just nominally, work with and for people from whole planet on stuff that matters. I learned a lot as person and a developer from
    &lt;a href="http://www.aptivate.org/en/about/team/" title="Aptivate's team page"&gt;
     my colleagues
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and I enjoy my work as much as when I started. However getting accustomed to our way of doing things and things we do can create a small worry of where I will be able to work, if I ever have to leave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It was definitely a year of personal change. Not sure who to “blame” for rediscovering a radical streak in me, but I am less willing to be silent when encountering prejudice and small-mindedness. Silence condones and some troubles should be embraced.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I would like to finish
    &lt;a href="http://www.delajozate.si/" title="All you ever wanted to learn about Slovenian Parliament"&gt;
     existing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/marela2" title="Great upcoming personal photo sharing app"&gt;
     projects
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that already have good foundations and to promote building web services for low-bandwidth environments (where low-bandwidth doesn’t mean just slow). That really should be enough. I expect it will be an interesting year.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    As a proponent of a view that 3D printing will radically change our society I read with great interest
    &lt;a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/digital_fabrication/the_future_of_3d_printing_mere_misnomer_or_something_more_23835.asp" title=" The Future of 3D Printing: Mere Misnomer or Something More?"&gt;

    &lt;a href="http://graehamdouglas.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/3d-printers-are-not-the-future-of-manufacturing/" title="erspective on 3D printers from a mechanical designer"&gt;
     enthusiastic outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    written by people who obviously have more relevant experience and knowledge than me. They don’t quite reach a consensus, but have a fairly uniform sentiment I would like to address. While I do agree with most of their arguments and conclusions, I don’t with all and more importantly I think they are kind of missing the point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The above linked articles are really worth reading, but hopefully I won’t do them too much of disservice if I sum them up with: 3D printing will be too costly, too difficult, not useful enough and of too low general quality to have the same pattern of adoption as 2D printers which means they won’t end up in every home (with some type of computer).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Each of these points is true right now. It costs more to print an otherwise mass produced item (especially if you need to also buy a 3D printer). Of course this becomes less relevant if you want to create things that are not mass produced (
    &lt;a href="pimping-my-notebook.html" title="My 3D print fix for a design problem"&gt;
     or at all
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ), but even then you would be better off using an existing printing service (as I did). However cost of printers and materials have come down tremendously in last few years and it’s not difficult for me to imagine that at some point they will become accessible enough to become an impulsive buy. If we only bought stuff we need when it makes rational economic sense, we would own far fewer things than we do. Often they just have to become cheap enough and as cars attest that doesn’t even mean cheap.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is also true that preparing models for printing is not easy. However it is much easier than it used to be and I don’t see why it wouldn’t become even more so in the same way as have tools for other once specialist tasks (like photo editing). I am old enough to remember word processing of mid 80-ies and as much as  incanting commands was unappealing then, you don’t see many people needing to struggle with this today. And there could be even more help in form of existing downloadable designs or 3D scanners which could reduce burden of design from scratch to making small corrections instead.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Will we need printers often enough? No idea. I print on paper only before traveling and would likely use 3D printer more often, but I suspect I represent mostly me. I don’t know why anyone would still need a printer, but enough of them do that there is no shortage of models aimed at home owners. I did notice how my brush with 3D printing changed the way I perceive plasticity of my environment and while it is hard to tell how my view and use would be shaped if printing was even more accessible (I expect more things would get fixed instead of replaced), it is even harder to imagine that they wouldn’t. I am sure this would be even more true for kids growing in environment which is more pliable than today’s.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    An often repeated argument is that quality of printed stuff is not high enough. This may well be in most cases, but I expect will be less so over time. I don’t expect cheap printers or materials to catch up with expensive brethren or other options anytime soon if ever, but they may not need to.
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Description on Wikipedia"&gt;
     Illuminated manuscripts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    were supplanted by printed books even though they
    &lt;strong&gt;
     never
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    achieved their quality. Books simply became good enough. As millions of Instagram photos prove deficiencies can also lead to its own esthetic (but I wouldn’t count on this).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is difficult if not foolish to predict future of a particular technology, but when I do attempt it, I try to do two things. One is to list all its current limitations and try to imagine a future without them. If technology is not interesting enough without them, then it’s really hopeless. The other thing I do is to look at development so far and try to extrapolate what will happen to those limitations and how soon from technological and wider social context stand point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t expect 3D printing to follow an adoption curve of some other technology as this rarely happens. There is indeed a fundamental difference best captured by
    &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other/" title="Check fourth paragraph"&gt;
     Jon Evans’ observation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that we print on paper to convey information and use 3D printers to produce stuff. I do believe home 3D printers will eventually be at least as prevalent as paper printers if for no other reason because our appetite for stuff won’t go away as much as our need to use paper as a transport medium. However I also expect them to be present in houses void of geeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But my real point is that this doesn’t really matter. It seems there is an agreement that this technology together with others will radically transform our society and that bespoke manufacturing for individuals will again become more prevalent. Unless your business model absolutely depends on pushing millions of these printers in every home, does it really matter if I will print my designs on my printer or at a nearby corner shop?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t think it does as I don’t care if additive approach of printers wins over subtractive one of mills (however I find grinding inherently less appealing). In any case I do expect personal manufacturing to influence but not eradicate manufacturing industry and it will be interesting to see how much of it will see it as a threat needed to be countered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a month since we returned from our  traveling around
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia"&gt;
     Bolivia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It was the most exhausting trip I have ever done and I ended up so weak that what ought to be a minor cold landed me in bed for few days. Luckily this happened only
    &lt;em&gt;
     after
    &lt;/em&gt;
    our return, but still I didn’t get to write this post then and I’ve been struggling to find time for it every since.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="imageR" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/sets/72157630657887612/" title="Photos from Bolivia"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am not sure why I was so tired. We did spend quite a lot of time trekking, but not really more than we are used to. I suspect it had something to do with high altitude and sheer amount of information my brains tried to digest. A month of travel may sound long
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#bolivia-note-1" id="bolivia-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    , but it’s really too short to get to know a country especially one so big and unfamiliar as Bolivia. Best you can hope for is to learn enough to give your ignorance a bit of  a shape.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is also too short because you will need more time than you expect. One advice you hear often is that something will go wrong. It happened to us too and though you can be disappointed at times, you’ll mostly have fun, be amazed
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#bolivia-note-2" id="bolivia-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    and sometimes even shocked. Our schedule was packed and it will take me months to process all that we have seen and experienced, but I hope we can return soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Finding reasons to visit Bolivia is easy. Finding help for organizing this trip may prove more difficult. Pick an agency and search will turn up somebody who had a horrible experience with them. Not us though. We met amazing people who really worked hard to make our trip unforgettable which leads me to real reason for writing this post.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you intend to go and would like some local help, here are our recommendations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no shortage of hotels in La Paz and mid range
    &lt;a href="http://www.hotelrosario.com/la-paz/"&gt;
     hotel Rosario
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has deservedly consistently high reviews. It has great front desk staff (especially Ximenia), nice rooms and location. Dinners are consistently great too, but I would avoid lunch. Same kitchen but apparently different team and what you get might not be
    &lt;em&gt;
     exactly
    &lt;/em&gt;
    what you ordered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.america-ecotours.com/"&gt;
     America Tours
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is a travel agency recommended by Lonely Planet which can help you organize your way around country. Speed with which they were able to organize alternatives to our cancelled our trip to Madidi (thanks Amazsonas for nothing) was simply amazing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most people who visit Potosi stay in town. It’s certainly cheaper than alternatives, but if you can afford it, then a good place to stay is at
    &lt;a href="http://www.hotelmuseocayara.com/"&gt;
     hotel museo Cayara
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that is about half an hour drive away. Museum and a chance to talk to Arturo alone are worth it. Hacienda that has been there since 1557 is in the middle of beautiful nature and away of polluted surroundings of Potosi and is a popular destination for daily trips organized by travel agencies in Potosi (a good alternative for those on small budgets).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Usual way of seeing the largest salt flat in world is to travel to Uyuni and take a trip with one of many unreliable operators who are often hostages to their prone-to-drinking drivers. I believe it is better to travel to Tupiza (if you have time) and take a slightly longer tour. We had really good experience with
    &lt;a href="http://www.tupizatours.com/index.php"&gt;
     Tupiza Tours
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but my advice to those who prefer email for arranging their trips, is to start at least a couple of weeks before they go because girls at Tupiza Tours seem to be swamped in work. Or call them if you can. If you pick them, then ask for Hernan Cordova, the best off-road driver we have ever met (and Spanish speaking guide), and Jeaneth Menchaca Condori if you need an English speaking guide. They went above and beyond their duty, really made every effort to anticipate our wishes and needs and had an unlimited amount of patience.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are many agencies in La Paz that will take you trekking and prices vary significantly.
    &lt;a href="http://www.andeansummits.com/"&gt;
     Andean Summits
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is certainly not among the cheapest, but they are very professional and accommodating (like with our last minute request to change dates of our trek). Ask also for Gustavo Miranda Hulliri, who apart from being a great cook and camp manager also seems to know every path there is. This can be really useful if you, say, get really weak because you were throwing up all previous day.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tourist guides in Bolivia have to be certified. Most of them studied tourism and are very good. Still we were especially impressed by Julia Catunta Janco who consistently surprised us with showing us things we wouldn’t even think of asking. She would be our first choice unless you go climbing. Contact me if you need her email address.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One sure sign that your guide was really good is that saying goodbye feels like leaving a good friend. It is a feeling we didn’t expect before, but felt repeatedly once we were there. Life is too short to visit every place we would like to see, but I still have no doubt that we will return. I hope this post has been of some help to those of you who might be thinking of visiting Bolivia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="bolivia-note-1"&gt;
     Popular stereotype of a Japanese tourist used to be someone who took pictures non-stop. Someone explained to me once that this is a necessary memory aid for short vacations with packed schedule because it can help you recall and organize memories later when you’re back. I don’t know if this is true for Japanese, but it is certainly true for me.
     &lt;a href="#bolivia-1"&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="bolivia-note-2"&gt;
     I knew Bolivia was rich in minerals, but I had no idea that there were so many mines which often exist in the most inhospitable places. Even big scale mining (such as for silver around Potosi) is usually done individually and this is even more true for small mines where there may be only 10 or so miners risking their life. It’s very hard and often short way to live that can still be better than alternatives.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We visited a wonderful exhibition a few days ago about two failed Antarctica expeditions led by
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="Robert Scott at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Scott
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton" title="Ernest Shackleton at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Shackleton
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I learned a lot, but what I keep thinking of are Frank Hurley’s glass plates.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hurley" title="Frank Hurley at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Frank Hurley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was the official photographer on Shackleton’s
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition" title="More at Wikipedia"&gt;
     Trans-Antarctic expedition
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (1914-1917). Shackleton and his crew encountered ice farther to the north then they expected and eventually got stuck in it. It is impossible to imagine how they felt when their efforts to free their ship Endurance proved unfruitful and had to spent arctic winter on it. Ship had to be abandoned by the end of October 1915 before surrounding ice crushed it. Crew then spent next few months on floating ice. They decided to seek safety on land which meant hauling what they needed by themselves and leaving everything else behind. Which brings us to Hurley’s plates.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    These were early days of photography and equipment was larger than it is now, but even today’s gear for taking large format photographs is pretty big and heavy as are prints made with it. Hurley had two cameras, a large format one capturing images on glass plates and a smaller portable Kodak using film
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#glass-plates-note-1" id="glass-plates-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . He made more than 500 images on plates which were too heavy to carry them all, but he managed to persuade Shackleton to pick and keep 120 or 150, depending on source
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#glass-plates-note-2" id="glass-plates-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Then he broke the rest.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I couldn’t find an explanation for his action in one of the most inhospitable places on earth where environment should soon enough destroy those plates without his help, but I think I know why he did it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Expeditions were expensive and selling publishing rights for images made during trip was an important source of funding. Breaking plates ensured them that their images would be the only ones that could be printed. Breaking them was in essence an enforcement of copyright.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is no moral to this story. It was doubtless a difficult decision in even more difficult situation. But it is hard to look at remaining images and not feel a real sense of loss. Such a waste!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are in London these days, then go and see this exhibition which you can find at
    &lt;a href="http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/"&gt;
     Queen’s gallery
    &lt;/a&gt;
    just next to Buckingham’s palace until April 14th. I bet you won’t regret it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Exhibition closed and my theory is wrong. As visitor pointed out (with Frank’s own words) plates were broken to remove temptation to return for them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="glass-plates-note-1"&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but three are probably enough. So here’s my annual list of books I read in 2011. I typed “this year” first. Obviously celebrating new year is not enough for my mind to completely switch and I’ll probably be in danger of writing 2011 where I shouldn’t for another fortnight or so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Why I stopped"&gt;
     stopped striving
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to read a certain number of books and I’m happier for it. Looking at the list I am mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice of books related to my career. It’s not that books themselves would be that bad (most weren’t), but why on earth did I spent so much time reading things tangentially related to what I do?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To safeguard from my tweaking of this blog’s theme, here are recommended spelled out:
    &lt;em&gt;
     Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Unfolding of Language
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . I also want to specifically mention
    &lt;em&gt;
     Copper
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     Atlas of Remote Islands
    &lt;/em&gt;
    both great in their own way which are not bolded but maybe they should be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon  and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following  these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of  another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise to fix it for next year’s list, especially since I’ve never earned enough to buy even one book.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Without further ado here is the list:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316069884"&gt;
       Eating Animals
      &lt;/a&gt;

      The Cello Suites: J. S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a Baroque Masterpiece

      The Yacoubian Building
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Alaa Al Aswany. I read this at the end of January, when Egypt was engulfed in protests against regime and it provided an excellent background to why protests were happening. A truly captivating look at modern Egypt society.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      Introducing HTML5

      HTML5: Up and Running
     &lt;/a&gt;

     . Without a doubt one of the best books I read in years and also one of the most heart wrenching. Literature at its best.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       Skylight
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by David Hare
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Great drama with amazing amount of substance. Probably not for you if you are politically right (wrong) leaning.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      The Elements of Content Strategy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Erin Kissane. Good overview which confirmed it’s not a problem I’d have. Or career I’d choose.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     EffectiveUI by EffectiveUI. Overview with some concrete propositions written for audience that doesn’t include me.

      97 Things Every Programmer Should Know
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Kevlin Henney. Mostly uncontroversial and insightful often enough to be worth at least a quick browse.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652269X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=059652269X"&gt;
      97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Richard Monson-Haefel. Kind of like the previous one, only for software architects.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      Confessions of a Public Speaker
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Scott Berkun. A fun book with lots of good tips which still can’t make you a good speaker without practice.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449307116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449307116"&gt;
      Think Stats
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Allen B. Downey. I read this book too soon, before it was published. Content was promising, but code was sloppy and buggy. Most useful to (Python) programmers who want to learn basic statistics.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AH7GO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0056AH7GO"&gt;
      Dry Side Up
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Martin Ony. I know Martin so I may be biased, but I also don’t like travel literature. This is the book I would get if I wanted to know how it FEELS like to raft through Grand Canyon. Fun to read even if you don’t have such plans.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Snuff
     &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      The Chains of Heaven: An Ethiopian Romance
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Philip Marsden. Interesting, insightful, fluid, but still travel literature. I liked it as much as I can like travel literature.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai. A rather uneven book that doesn’t quite live up to praise it received. Sometimes brilliant, often not, but almost always tragic.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545098939/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0545098939"&gt;
      Copper
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Kazu Kibuishi. A melancholic comic about a boy and his dog that fits my temperament perfectly. Most, but not all, cartoons can be found on web, yet book is still worth buying.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Unfolding of Language
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Guy Deutscher
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Fascinating and well-written book about how human languages did and might have developed. Can’t recommend highly enough.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      23 Things They Don’t Tell You about Capitalism
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Ha-Joon Chang. A must read for free-market proponents and less so for well-read people. It contains some surprising information for everyone and is easy to read. I wish though there were more links to data in notes.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one reason or another put off. I find I read too much from “Anglo-Saxon” authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s hard to judge importance of events as they are unfolding or soon afterwards, but 2011 feels in many ways like a historical year and I will be amazed if it doesn’t prove to be such. Arab spring and
    &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598"&gt;
     unresolved eurozone crisis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    alone practically guarantee that this will be a year to remember although it’s too soon to say in what light. There are definitely plenty of good reasons to worry, but there always are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year was also a year of big personal changes. I left
    &lt;a href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Zemanta's homepage"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in summer and went on sabbatical. Leaving a company in  the middle of economic crisis doesn’t sound like a prudent idea, but I’ve yet to regret it. I started contributing open source before I left, but having more time certainly helped me do more of it and with a bit of luck I may even finish first version of my web Instapaper client before this year runs out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I built
    &lt;a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si/" title="Supervizor's homepage"&gt;
     Supervizor
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with Primož, which is a project I am most proud of. We haven’t done everything we set to do yet and we unlikely will this year, but I hope that in early 2012 Supervizor’s data will become easily accessible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There were lots of experiments on myself. Having a list of possible (and finished) projects on wall feels liberating. Counting books I read
    &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="My post on gamification of reading"&gt;
     doesn’t work
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but digital sabbath is great. I left Twitter for better use of my time, but it’s really too soon to tell. I  learned and did a lot, more than I expected, but as always less than I hoped. Somewhat unintentionally we reduced our carbon footprint further even though we traveled a lot.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also finally found time to really reflect on what I want to do and my
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html" title="Brad Neuberg's post on creating personal reasearch agenda"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is getting more of a shape. I want to work most on use of open data to improve civic engagement and exploring
    &lt;a href="reading-sources.html" title="Link to definition in second annotation"&gt;
     social software for introverts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what will 2012 bring?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nobody really knows, but this year it became clear to me that I want my work to be more socially engaged and I am thrilled I got an opportunity to join amazing people at
    &lt;a href="http://www.aptivate.org/" title="Aptivate's homepage"&gt;
     Aptivate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for I hope a long time. I’ll continue to work on a so far semi-public open data project which I am sure will become public soon. I plan to read lots of books, but start less than two new projects. I am sure I won’t finish everything I set to do, but that’s alright. We always overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in ten so I  just need to keep going.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And surely I will continue to worry. There are only more reasons to despair over environment and eurozone of today might not be around this time next year. However we are not pilling on canned food yet so optimist in me obviously hasn’t completely died yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But first I will enjoy holidays. I hope you will too and I wish you a happy new year.
   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I never intended to, but somehow missed last few elections because they were on dates when we were travelling. It looks like this time will be different so we have spent quite some time so far thinking about whom to give our votes. Like most people I know I find most parties in Slovenia distasteful and while I am not enamoured by anyone, I think I will be able to cast a vote. But I do wish our system was slightly different.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s what I would change if I could:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      Introduce a
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_voting" rel="wikipedia" title="Preferential voting"&gt;
       preferential vote
      &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/em&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     (only first and second choice). It kind of sucks that you have to decide between a party that you would like to vote for and a party that actually has a chance of getting in parliament according to polls. I know I am not alone with this dilemma and I often wonder who people would pick if they were not afraid of “wasting” their vote.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting" rel="wikipedia" title="Compulsory voting"&gt;
       Compulsory voting
      &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/em&gt;
     (but only with point 3). Everyone who can vote really should unless they can provide a good reason why they can’t. Voting every few years really should be the bare minimum of citizen’s civic engagement.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;
      Add an explicit choice “Nobody from this list”.
     &lt;/em&gt;
     Voting for least awful can still be unpalatable. Right now we also can’t distinguish between people who didn’t want to vote for anyone on the ballot and those who couldn’t be bothered. It’s easy to see low turnouts as a failure of democratic process when it has less to do with process and more with available choices. “Nobody” votes should be counted when calculating parliamentary threshold since they are votes against all parties, and ignored when calculating how many seats parties in parliament get.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regretfully these changes wouldn’t benefit parties in parliament (whichever they are or will be) so there is  almost a zero chance that above changes will happen. Unless of course there is enough popular support to have a referendum.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do practically all of my work on Sony VAIO notebook I bought 3 years ago. I picked it because it was very light (less than 1.5kg), small, had great screen, keyboard and battery that seemed to last forever (around 11 hours without WiFi and about 8 with it). I still love this machine, but it has a remarkable design failure. Let’s see if you can spot it on this picture?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Detail of Sony VAIO showing power on/off switch" class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/switch.jpg" title="Power on/off switch"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That glassy looking button is an on/off switch. It responds to light pressure and it protrudes from notebook even when lid is closed. What could possibly go wrong?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After a while I got tired of my notebook getting turned off while I carried it and made what I believed would be a temporary fix until I figure out something better
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#pimp-notebook-1-note" id="pimp-notebook-1"&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . A cap for button made out of layers of paper for sturdiness (I should at least use paperboard) glued together and reinforced with copious amounts of Scotch tape. It looked ugly, but mostly worked.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem with temporary fixes is that they tend to become permanent. I think this happens when they are too successful and remove too much pain, but it’s hard to find that sweet spot of enough uneasiness without actual aggravation. Maybe it doesn’t even exist.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So I’ve been using it ever since with a firm intention to figure out a better way to fix it. I finally decided to draw what I need and print it at
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.shapeways.com" rel="homepage" title="Shapeways"&gt;
     Shapeways
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#pimp-notebook-2-note" id="pimp-notebook-2"&gt;
      [2]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    . Here are results:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="3 switch protectors. Old one made out of paper and two new ones." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/protectors.jpg" title="Switch protectors - old and new"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I made two (left is old paper one), because it takes them a while to print and deliver them to Europe, I had no experience with materials and they are relatively cheap. They also looked better before I sandpapered them somewhat for a better fit. In fact both of them were completely black.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A couple of tips if you intend to use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://sketchup.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google SketchUp"&gt;
     SketchUp
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for drawing models. SketchUp was really made for drawing sketches of buildings so when you start it, you’ll see an image of a person (to help you scale your sketch). That image is an object and you have to delete it if you don’t want it to screw up your measurements in exported file. The other consequence of SketchUp purpose is that anything you draw has no depth. This didn’t matter to me since required thickness of protector cylinder was about the same as minimum thickness that 3D printer can print. If this is not true for you, then you’ll probably need to do some post-processing (search Shapeways for tutorials).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My notebook has been “on the road” and has performed admirably apart from a failed battery latch which forced me to now use a lower capacity battery (which still gets me through a typical conference day). But 3 years is forever for wandering notebook so it was no big surprise that frame of its screen eventually cracked. Superglue didn’t fix it and I was thinking about gluing a piece of wood or metal to screen for reinforcement, but I hate the idea of additional weight. It would also look awful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At about same time I was snooping around
    &lt;a href="http://store.mozilla.org/"&gt;
     Mozilla store
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to see if there was something I like which I could buy to support my favorite web project and discovered laptop skins. I was never a fan of covering my laptop with stickers from various startups (why would anyone want that?), but this was perfect. I’m not sure from what kind of material the skins are made of, but they are thin and don’t tear easily. With another layer of Scotch tape I got something that I think looks great and provides enough protection for a now more careful user:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="aligncenter"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Shows back of notebook with new skin and switch protector attached." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/final.jpg" title="New back of notebook and switch protector"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looks great, right?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="pimp-notebook-1-note"&gt;
     I still find it amazing that this problem wasn’t caught before release.  Eventually they noticed it and later models got buttons that need more pressure to trigger and are better shielded from environment.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E65" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia E65"&gt;
     Nokia E65
    &lt;/a&gt;
    user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on

    is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    We came from
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.corse.fr/" rel="homepage" title="Corsica"&gt;
     Corsica
    &lt;/a&gt;
    vacation recently and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south of the island. It’s a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent an apartment in the old town itself – you might feel as a part of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Typeface used for suggestions was
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans" rel="wikipedia" title="Comic Sans"&gt;
     Comic Sans
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more despised and ridiculed
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" rel="wikipedia" title="Typeface"&gt;
     typefaces
    &lt;/a&gt;
    around. My unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than others.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It obviously doesn’t leave people untouched, since they keep on using it when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers. I’ve also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested in type.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually means) just as it doesn’t make Madonna a good singer. It does however speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply unmoved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn’t designed for.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it’s probably more because it is less general, less bland than, say,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" rel="wikipedia" title="Times Roman"&gt;
     Times Roman
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the end I have to admit I don’t have a bigger point than simple admission I’m not affronted by it anymore. I can’t muster a will to protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end harmless.

   &lt;p&gt;
    This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won’t, look forward to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven’t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn’t mean short on value).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     The Pursuit of Glory
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Your soul will thank you for this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483"&gt;
      Coders At Work
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Peter Seibel. Fascinating look into titans of programming, but you probably have to be a programmer to enjoy reading it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802715354?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0802715354"&gt;
       The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Kate Summerscale
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Amazing book. An intriguing never solved crime gets well researched to the point where it can present a plausible explanation of what happened. Also well written, so it’s hard to imagine being bored.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714838128?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0714838128"&gt;
      A Smile in the Mind
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Beryl McAlhone, David Stuart. A compendium of different ways in which design can delight us. It’s a topic that can’t be distilled in a how-to, but it does come close.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Fixed to Flexible: Four Simple Lessons about Cost, Price, Margin and The Options Available to The 21st Century Business by Todd Sattersten. An ebook I forgotten and hence can’t judge.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292"&gt;
      Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Steve Krug. His first book is legendary. Second probably won’t be, but it’s still a very good (and quick) read if you want to learn effective usability testing on cheap.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      Designing books: practice and theory
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jost Hochuli, Robin Kinross. A book about book design from a long time practitioner. Great read for us who are into that sort of thing and don’t disdain swiss design, but it’s likely boring to everyone else.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321643380?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321643380"&gt;
      Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Dan Cederholm. Dan shows how you can use CSS3 today to progressively improve pages. Not quite the same approach as Andy Clarke’s (missing because I read it this year), but they both persuasively teach you to do more today.
    &lt;/li&gt;

       The Crusades through Arab Eyes
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Amin Maalouf
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Title really says all. I started reading this one together with comprehensive tome from western PoV (which I plan to finish in 2011). I can recommend it even to those, who don’t have a particular interest in crusades.
    &lt;/li&gt;

      The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources
     &lt;/a&gt;

      High Performance Javascript

      One Dimensional Woman
     &lt;/a&gt;

      Street Fighting Mathematics
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Sanjoy Mahajan. More involved, but also more general approaches to getting fairly accurate estimates than in Mind Performance Hacks
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto. Don’t know what to think of it, except that translation seems dubious.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

       The Absence of War
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by David Hare
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Great political drama that is still relevant.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483299?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1594483299"&gt;
      The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Junot Diaz. Liked it a lot, but still having a feeling that I missed a lot by not understanding untranslated Spanish parts.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

       Too Loud a Solitude
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Bohumil Hrabal
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Everything reviewers said: short, eccentric, playful and…a must read.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387356?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307387356"&gt;
      Master of Shadows: The Secret Diplomatic Career of the Painter Peter Paul Rubens

    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Pursuit of Glory
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Tim Blanning
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Could be the best history book I’ve ever read and its lingering effect on me might make it also one of most?influential.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883513006?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1883513006"&gt;
      Costa Rica: A Traveler’s Literary Companion
     &lt;/a&gt;
     edited by Barbara Ras. I planned to read this while we travelled around Costa Rica, but failed. I read most of it during our last days on the trip and on our way home. Uneven, with some stories quite good while others resulting in “huh?”, but you do see country differently and I would recommend it to all who plan to travel there.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also discovered
    &lt;a href="http://www.granta.com/"&gt;
     Granta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a really great literary magazine through which you can discover new authors or simply authors you don’t know yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the end I would like to mention a book I read this year, so it’s not on the list, but which I find too important to ignore for a year. It’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316069884"&gt;
     Eating Animals
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Jonathan Safran Foer. If you care what you eat and especially if that involves meat, you ought to read it. It’s well researched and even better written book that will inform you what “western” meat production means these days. I don’t think I can recommend it enough.

     Costa Rica
    &lt;/a&gt;
    two days ago after a month spent there. It’s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn’t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.

   &lt;p&gt;
    But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote
    &lt;a href="2009-review.html" title="Last year's review"&gt;
     my yearly review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it’s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn’t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess it’s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as

     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ‘s product guy ended after several months and I still have mixed feelings about the whole thing. I haven’t finished much of what I started, exception being
    &lt;a href="http://lint.brihten.com/html/" title="HTML Lint homepage"&gt;
     HTML Lint
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which was mostly
    &lt;a href="http://fry.si/outbreak/" title="Fry's homepage"&gt;
     Fry’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    work anyway.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn’t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won’t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO
    &lt;sub&gt;

    &lt;/sub&gt;
    while travelling than last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am more optimistic about next year.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" rel="wikipedia" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference"&gt;
     COP16
    &lt;/a&gt;
    wasn’t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I’ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I
    &lt;a href="sabbatical.html"&gt;
     plan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years…Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133" rel="amazon" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich"&gt;
     4 hour work week
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why
    &lt;sup&gt;
     [
     &lt;a href="#book-1"&gt;
      1
     &lt;/a&gt;
     ]
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    again draws no sympathy from me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So….What do I want?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/" rel="homepage" title="Pixel Qi"&gt;
     Pixel Qi
    &lt;/a&gt;
    will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol style="margin-top:3em"&gt;
    &lt;li id="book-1"&gt;
     You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.

    Aleš recently
    &lt;a href="http://blog.spetic.si/2010/09/importance-of-sabbatical.html"&gt;
     wrote
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about importance of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical" rel="wikipedia" title="Sabbatical"&gt;
     sabbatical
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I could not agree more.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn’t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don’t, you really ought to find something. I’ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you’ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can – in time and geography. I haven’t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Three months ago I received an invitation to try and review
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://toshl.com" rel="homepage" title="Toshl"&gt;
     Toshl
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a mobile expense tracker developed by
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.3fs.si" rel="homepage" title="ThirdFrameStudios"&gt;
     ThirdFrameStudios
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I also received code to get? Pro account free for first year to help me test it, which saved me a modest amount of 20 euros. It is also not a secret that I know people working at 3fs and admire their work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As influences go, that’s it. I received neither threats to pets I don’t have or contributions to a bank account I do have. Also a complete absence of nudges means that this post took longer than planned and that all opinions are mine. Too make them less ignorant I decided at start to give Toshl a proper test and use it for couple of months before passing judgment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Toshl, as mentioned, is a tool for keeping track of expenses. You are obviously sensible enough to know why this is wise, if you are still reading this, so I won’t bother explaining. It comes as a free application for
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android"&gt;
     Android
    &lt;/a&gt;
    devices and
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.maemo.org/" rel="homepage" title="Maemo"&gt;
     Maemo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    based N900. I heard rumors of an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage" title="iPhone 3G"&gt;
     iPhone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    version, but Symbian or
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.blackberry.com/" rel="homepage" title="BlackBerry"&gt;
     BlackBerry
    &lt;/a&gt;
    owners are out of luck (for now). Using web based companion and synchronization is free too, but you have to pay for Pro account if you want to add expenses through website or need a more flexible export of your data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I tested Nokia N900 version of Toshl and liked it. I don’t want to go into details since they quickly become boring and there is no better test than your own (remember, it’s free). I was impressed how well it handles
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator" rel="wikipedia" title="Decimal separator"&gt;
     decimal separator
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for me, since I sin by using both comma and point.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Entering expenses is easy and quick, especially if you have entered similar recently, since you can reuse tags just by clicking on suggested. You also see already entered expenses sorted by time or tags. There is still room for improvement (like adapting tags suggestions based on first entered), but not much to fault.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe Toshl’s goal is to be as simple and fun tracker of everyday expenses as possible. You can do basic add and removal of expenses, export inserted data, categorize each entry with tags and see few different reports. That’s it. There is no integration with banks, currency conversions,? or even a notion of income. Reports are basic and I am not a fan of those included.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I usually used more than one tag on each expense and had difficulty wrapping my head around graphs where same expense could be shown multiple times. I failed at judging how much impact do some expenses have overall without at least some tweaking of graphs. I am certain that Tufte would call it chartjunk, but their implementation certainly is fun to play with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And that’s where Toshl’s main strength is. A fun way of doing something that most people find incredibly tedious. You might overgrow it one day and switch, but it will help you develop a necessary habit of recording your expenses.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Being simple and fun doesn’t mean powerless. Tags free you to your own categorization and multiple export options give you an opportunity to massage that data further in tools of your choice. It might not be as trivial as clicking on a graph is, but doing it in Excel is not much harder.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I will not continue to use it because I am that sort of person who gets off on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" rel="wikipedia" title="Double-entry bookkeeping system"&gt;
     double-entry bookkeeping
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’ve been using
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.gnucash.org/" rel="homepage" title="GnuCash"&gt;
     GnuCash
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for years and there is no easy way to sync data with it (probably shouldn’t be either) and few reasons to input every expense twice. I do recommend anyone who isn’t tracking yet or is not satisfied with his current approach to give Toshl a try.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And if you are happy with free version, then buy a Pro account. It costs little, gives you features as polished as rest of service and it help secure your apps future.

     Aaron Swartz’s review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of books and thought it was a great idea that I should copy. I don’t know why exactly. Maybe to better track how much I actually read. Or using a goal to promote more reading when I felt I haven’t read enough. Maybe it was just to learn what topics drew me particular year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Who knows? Probably all of these reasons played a role.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My private goal was to read a book every fortnight, so about 26 in total. I read 37, some of which admittedly very light in content or girth.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Time to present the books, listed in chronological order. I linked those I liked and set in bold those I recommend. Unlinked were either bad or intended for someone I can’t relate to.
   &lt;/p&gt;

      Thursday Next: First Among Sequels
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Jasper Fforde. Fantasy series for book lovers. Enjoyed more if you’ve read a lot.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516258?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596516258"&gt;
      Designing Web Interfaces
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Bill Scott, Theresa Neil. Components of modern web applications. A book that should be on the shelf of every web interaction designer.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       Reader
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Bernhard Schlink
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Excellent book, haven’t seen the movie.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;

       The Wall Jumper
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Peter Schneider
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Timeless portrait of German separation.

      Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Adam Greenfield. Really late to the party with this one, but still a good and fairly unbiased treatise on intelligent tools and environments and problems related to them.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/AlwaysBuilding/"&gt;
      Always Building: The Programmable Environment

      Javascript: The Good Parts
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Douglas Crockford. Concise but informative description of good parts of Javascript useful for most programmers.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060934719?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060934719"&gt;

       Ender’s Game
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Orson Scott Card
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . As good as people say.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061092177?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061092177"&gt;
       Small Gods
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Terry Pratchett
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . In my opinion still the best book by Terry.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1932111972"&gt;
      A Theory of Fun for Game Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Raph Koster. Worth reading if you want to know what makes games fun and what to expect in future.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0091914353?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0091914353"&gt;
       Aid and Other Dirty Business: How Good Intentions Have Failed the World’s Poor
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Giles Bolton
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Excellent when looking at facts of aid “business” (first 4/5 of the book). Weak when it comes to solutions with seemingly unlimited faith in globalism and power of a consumer.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345460626?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0345460626"&gt;
      The Caryatids
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Bruce Sterling. Interesting and occasionally excellent, but a bit of a let down compared to some of his other work.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123740371?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0123740371"&gt;
      Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Bill Buxton. Excellent book about sketching and its role in design. A must read for practitioners.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192854534?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0192854534"&gt;
      The Buddha: A Very Short Introduction
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Michael Carrithers. Buddism seen through life of the Buddha.

      Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Paul Bahn. Fun.

    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0976470705"&gt;
       The Four Steps to Epiphany
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Steven Gary Blank
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . I can’t recommend this book highly enough to anyone starting a new venture. Absolutely a must read.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199205590?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199205590"&gt;
      The First World War: A Very Short Introduction
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Michael Howard. Short, but good.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everyman-Philip-Roth/dp/061873516X"&gt;
      Everyman
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Philip Roth. Facing old age and death, a book I liked more than my wife.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192806467?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0192806467"&gt;
      Contemporary Art: A Very Short Introduction
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Julian Stallabrass. How contemporary art (world) functions and less what it is.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192853902?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0192853902"&gt;
      Judaism: A Very Short Introduction
     &lt;/a&gt;

       By Night in Chile
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Roberto Bolano
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Discovered by method of pulling random books from shelves in book store. Absolutely superb.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471295639?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0471295639"&gt;
       Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Peter L. Bernstein
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . A book about history of risk management made only more relevant by last financial crisis. Fun and very informative.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670058122?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0670058122"&gt;
      Forget Kathmandu: An Elegy for Democracy
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Manjushree Thapa. Modern history of Nepal told through personal experience. Recommended if you are interested in Nepal.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140435050?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140435050"&gt;
       The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Lawrence Sterne
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . Hard to believe that 250 years old novel can feel so modern.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061161705?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061161705"&gt;
       Unseen Academicals
      &lt;/a&gt;
      by Terry Pratchett
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     . I might be biased, but I would put it among his best novels.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/"&gt;
      Prototyping: A Practitioner’s Guide
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Todd Zaki Warfel. I never got around writing review of this book. Definitely worth a read for practitioners.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596155514?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596155514"&gt;
      Getting Started with Arduino
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Massimo Banzi. Aimed at designers, but learned few new things anyway.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679603360?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=devel-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679603360"&gt;
      The City: A Global History
     &lt;/a&gt;
     by Joel Kotkin. Sort of a short introduction to history of cities with everything good and bad that format entails. Excellent starting point for those interested in its subject.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wish I read as much as Aaron (

     latest review
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ), who seems to devour about hundred books per year, but I don’t think I’ll ever manage that. My goal for this year is going to be about same, 25 books before bells toll midnight on 31st of December. It still is an ambitious goal, since these days I seem to have a penchant for buying tomes at least 600 page thick and want to read more of other people’s code.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been six months since I wrote
    &lt;a href="dancing-on-titanic.html"&gt;
     my gloomy outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and unlike most things I wrote, my thoughts keep coming back to it and issues I talked about. My view hasn’t changed. 2009 is indeed shaping to be a great year for me and an awful one for world in general.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If a problem like over-fishing, that is both well-understood and has known and relatively cheap solutions, seems to be beyond our willingness to solve, what chance do we have then to find and implement solutions for problems that require enormously more effort and resources?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.ugotrade.com/2009/02/27/towards-a-newer-urbanism-talking-cities-networks-and-publics-with-adam-greenfield/" title="Adam Greenfield says it's game over."&gt;
     Game over
    &lt;/a&gt;
    indeed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t see our civilization surviving this century even if no giant rock crosses our path. There are many reasons for this, but none original or interesting enough to dwell upon. At the same time I do think this is not the last century in which humans live.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we are all indeed descendants of a tribe that at some point numbered only 2000 individuals, as I’ve heard in a lecture once, then it doesn’t take much to imagine that out of billions enough people will survive to continue our species existence. Not even me imagines a world completely void of water, plants or small furry animals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Alas civilization needs more than mere presence of humans. Inspired by Irish post-Roman example a question occured to me recently:
    &lt;em&gt;
     “Which 100 books would you try to preserve if you wanted to preserve our civilization?”
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Point being that if things go the way of Dodo and people have to fight for survival, it wouldn’t be reasonable to expect enlightened person or small groups to preserve many more books than that. And books are still the best way to preserve knowledge in long term. Other forms are either too transient or can pack information far less densely.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I quickly realized two things. First, that I have no clue which books I would pick. And second, that there are more fundamental questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Can a civilization fluidly metamorphose from failing to a new, thriving and likely different civilization or does the new one need to start anew from ashes of previous ones?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Question matters, because I imagine that civilizations are in a way like companies. Establishing one is quite different than keeping one going and hence knowledge needed is probably different too. Most historical examples I know of persuaded me that scale of a problem and length of time before its full consequences are felt are inversely proportional to likelihood of our dealing with it before it is too late. However I am not a historian and could well be wrong. Still, you do with what you have and this seems reasonable enough assumption for further inspection.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Assuming this,
    &lt;em&gt;
     what does it take to establish a civilization?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One thing that comes to mind is a high enough density of people who don’t spend all of their time procuring food. This means they can’t be hunter gatherers and some agricultural knowledge needs to survive to successfully plant and grow existing crops or tame new ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would also be helpful if all technological knowledge isn’t lost either. Electrical gadgets will be hopelessly obsolete, but creating and fixing a good plow or knowing how to preserve perishable goods for longer periods of time will not be something to sneeze at. World might be full of decrepit remains that might be reused, but there is no good reason to leave it just to human ingenuity to discover how and to what purpose.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another way to increase number of people living is to stop them dying needlessly. Hence preservation of most effective ways to stay healthy and low tech remedies for most common diseases and injuries would be helpful too. Most drugs will be gone for centuries, but it’s remarkable how much can be achieved with what will hopefully still be found in nature.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mathematics is also an underpreciated, yet necessary underpinning of every developed civilization. Calculus will not be needed from the get-go, but just counting doesn’t get you far either. There’s hardly a plan that couldn’t be improved with a sensible application of mathematics. Related to this, basic economics should be preserved too.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “There is no such thing as society,” said Margaret Thatcher, which of course is rubish and why it is not enough to learn how to live in complex social structures, but also why and in what ways. Therefore sociological and philosophical texts should also make cut. I find it difficult to imagine titles, because I don’t think culture is something you can implant. It is nurtured and developed not only by circumstances and challenges society faces, but also with choices it makes. It is unlikely that next round would follow our footsteps but optimist in me would love to leave something that inspires and gives something to aspire to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All these knowledge would be dead ink on paper if person holding a book doesn’t know how to read or what words actually mean. So alphabet learning book and a dictionary should also survive even though most of modern dictionary will probably be fairly useless by then and rest might be unhelpfully terse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last I would add a book about ecology trying to explain complexity of the world around us and why it would be wise to be careful how we try to change it. There is probably no better definition of stupidity then repeating same mistakes and expecting different results.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So
    &lt;em&gt;
     what did I end up with?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    An alphabet book, a dictionary and books about medicine, agriculture, mathematics, economy, sociology, philosophy, some basic technology and ecology. There are no titles since I don’t believe such books have been written yet. We have lived in a world full of books and knowledge for so long, that we simply never saw or had a reason to write a book premised on the idea, that it might be one of few books around.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In any case, even though I have spent more thoughts on this then is probably reasonable at this point, I am sure I haven’t thought of everything. What else have I missed?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My wife and I have a problem. We love buying and reading books, but ran out of shelf space for them years ago. So we’ve been storing some of them in closets and boxes while we find a more suitable solution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://pdml.net/pipermail/pdml_pdml.net/2009-February/161396.html"&gt;
     Like others
    &lt;/a&gt;
    we love physicality of books and it is hard to imagine buying artifacts that exist only in digital form. However, while searching for a good solution I did notice that useful life-span of most technical books is only few years and that we would save a lot of space and trees if I bought and read their electronic versions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This has lead to my renewed interest in state of electronic readers, which I’ve been following on and off since I first heard of technology almost a decade ago. In last few months I got a chance to try first version of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="homepage" title="Amazon Kindle"&gt;
     Kindle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , read few chapters on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader" rel="wikipedia" title="Sony Reader"&gt;
     Sony Reader
    &lt;/a&gt;
    PRS-505, checked how it feels to do it on
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch"&gt;
     iPod touch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and read
    &lt;a href="http://designingwebinterfaces.com/" title="Book's homepage"&gt;
     Designing Web Interfaces
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to the end on Nokia N770. By the way, I can only recommend that book to anyone interested in development of web applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So this post will be short overview of my experience so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Dedicated electronic readers
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As said, I’ve used Kindle1 and Sony PRS-505, although my experience so far has been mostly colored by later. Most if not all such currently available devices are based on same technology,
    &lt;a href="http://www.eink.com/"&gt;
     E-ink
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , and hence offer fairly similar reading experience as far as visuals go.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That experience is very good. It’s not quite paper, but it is certainly much nicer to read than computer screens, especially outside. It’s most annoying current limitation is probably absence of colors and depiction of b&amp;amp;w images in 16 or less shades of gray. You won’t be buying photo books for them any time soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What bothered me more though were tendency to use proprietary formats (Kindle) and absence of search (almost everyone else). I expected that device designers would notice that electronic format doesn’t offer a chance to flip through pages and remember position of interesting passages spatially and would counter this by adding a search function, yet most didn’t and as such these devices really are readers and not researchers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With good technical books I spend more time looking up pieces of information than I spent reading it in the first place. I guess I would be willing to sacrifice search if devices themselves were significantly cheaper, but since they aren’t, I won’t be buying one anytime soon.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, if you like reading lots of books but don’t care about owning them, you should really look into them. They are simply magnificient when it comes to packing A LOT of books into tiniest amount of space without sacrificing much readability. Hell, since most if not all readers allow you to set text size, it might even be easier to read on them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Tablets
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I own and use two, iPod touch and ancient
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia 770 Internet Tablet"&gt;
     Nokia N770
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s a common story with multipurpose devices. You get to do a lot with them, but you usually have to sacrifice something compared to specialised gadgets.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I haven’t read much on iPod touch and it’s unlikely I ever will. It has a fairly small screen (and screen resolution) that makes it rather unpleasant to read texts with plenty of tables and diagrams. Pinching screen looks nice on commercials and doesn’t bother me too much when browsing web, but it gets tiresome quickly enough that I don’t want to do it repeatedly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also tried Kindle application, which works well enough for literature, but is even more limiting than Kindle device. There is no search and you don’t flip through pages all the time only if you are comfortable with reading text at smallest font size.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nokia on the other hand has screen good and big enough that I needed to scroll only in one direction. Since that can be done with the same button that is used to flip through pages, I could read book using only one hand, which is nice since it let me read in most impossible body positions. As iPod touch it also has a color screen that is quite useful when dealing with technical material. What it lacks though is search in its PDF viewer that is also missing even in latest maemo incarnation on OS2008 (checked on Fry’s tablet).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Too bad. Nevertheless it will remain my main
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book" rel="wikipedia" title="E-book"&gt;
     ebook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    reading device for foreseeable future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Other observations
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As already noted, I feel current crop of readers are geared mainly to reading books and not much to browsing or searching. Since most of them are built on same technological base, it’s understandable that their hardware is very similar, but I was still surprised to see that same lack of distinction when it comes to features implemented in software.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I thought about buying printed and electronic copy, but changed my mind when I looked at
    &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516253/index.html"&gt;
     price of the bundle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . What I thought I would be buying is convenience. What price suggests to me is a sale of another copy. I probably would buy both, if price of bundle would be up to 15% higher than price of printed version.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That does not mean publishers are wrong, since I am hardly a representative sample, but I suspect I am not the only one who is thinking about building electronic library before they go ahead and purchase a reader. This transitioning phase where readers are not widespread yet might not be long enough to matter anyway and publishers probably don’t care about speeding it along since for most of them devices are just a content transportation mechanism that isn’t owned by them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tablets, with screen and resolution big enough work surprisingly well as long as you don’t try to read under direct sun light. Their other downsides are much shorter battery life and need for good eye-sight unless you are willing to scroll a lot.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, even though I won’t be buying an electronic reader this year, it is only a matter of time when one of them will replace my tablets as reading device.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s been a month since I got an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch"&gt;
     iPod touch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as a present and I’ve been using it regularly since. I still have and use both a
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia"&gt;
     Nokia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    N65 phone and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet"&gt;
     Nokia N770 tablet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but use of later has been diminished in last month.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     iPod touch experience
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t help not to think of Touch as basically this decade’s Palm organizer. Thin widget with pleasant user experience that can be extended with myriad of applications, whose developers are — judging by iPhone versions — limited not by their imagination, but with device capabilities and limited expandability.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still don’t like its on-screen keyboard and wish I had at least something like
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)"&gt;
     Graffiti
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Hence I don’t write on it anything longer than two sentences and together with lack of camera, built-in microphone, GPS, Bluetooth or even just self-made software, it makes Touch a read-mainly device. Consumer device would be another, more ghastly, but appropriate description.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a side note, even my now aged N770 tablet is more friendly to creators and hence I still find use for it. I just don’t want to browse web on it because of its very very dated browser that can’t be updated.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, even with annoying limitations I like iPod touch a lot. It’s hard not to with its polished interface and an
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" rel="homepage" title="App Store"&gt;
     App Store
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that is probably its killer application. Choice of applications in Slovenia is more limited than in USA, but still very wide and downloading them is so easy and cheap, you might have to fight against developing an addiction to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     So what about Nokia?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mobile devices space has become really interesting in last year. iPhone, iPod touch, Android with G1 and upcoming Palm Pre are finally bringing experience on web and otherwise, that we were promised years ago. But what this list lacks is any gadgets from Nokia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like Nokia. They had friendliest phones that are remarkably open in industry that likes to control everything. I think their tablets are great, even with shortcomings that should be resolved by now. But even with lots of innovation I get an impression that they are lagging behind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As a complete outsider who only passingly follows what is happening in mobile industry, I can only ignorantly speculate about its reasons and plans.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe first problem for Nokia is that unlike
    &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com/"&gt;
     Palm
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com" rel="homepage" title="Apple"&gt;
     Apple
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or even
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://google.com" rel="homepage" title="Google"&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    it’s not a niche player and tries to build phone for every possible user. It releases them too often. Taken together it is no wonder that just Nokia Europe
    &lt;a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products"&gt;
     lists
    &lt;/a&gt;
    115 devices that are either selling now, were recently or will be in near future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s too many devices, each with slightly different software, that create a very fragmented market. In such environment you can’t really hope that application would be pushing phones capabilities which aren’t there in most cases. Hence applications Nokia offers are not nearly as exciting as what Apple has.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Next problem presents development environment, which is simply awful.
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.symbian.com" rel="homepage" title="Symbian"&gt;
     Symbian
    &lt;/a&gt;
    might have been a nice platform back when, but its time has passed and I doubt open-sourcing it will help. Java hardly works better, but it’s probably a bit nicer to use even though it feels slower. Python is nice for tinkering, but not really an option until it becomes pre-installed. There’s also a web runtime, which is mostly missing. Few phones support it and only one phone available can use it for something more significant than a window to web.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Much of what I just said is not true for tablets, but historically they didn’t seem to get much love from company. Too bad, since I think they are one of the most exiciting things Nokia has.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I do remain an optimist. Purchase and relicensing of
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/" rel="homepage" title="Qt (toolkit)"&gt;
     Qt
    &lt;/a&gt;
    together with its upcoming S60 version signals that company is aware of development problems. Qt also offers a possibility of a framework that could be used everywhere and hopefully this will include Fremantle. Generally I don’t put too much faith in rumors, but some of them give credible hints that next tablet could be even better than an already great N810. If it also brings a distribution model comparable to App Store and a bit more polish, then it could be a big success even with non-geeks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But what they need to do in my opinion is spend less time trying to build all encompassing services like
    &lt;a href="http://www.ovi.com/"&gt;
     Ovi
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and spend more effort in building amazing devices that integrate well with what is already out there. And by integration I don’t mean an app hidden in some folder on phone. Upload to
    &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/"&gt;
     Flickr
    &lt;/a&gt;
    should be available right after you took a photo. I also wish they didn’t try to leverage existing platform and users so much and were more daring and forward looking. If platform you have is stopping you from developing a phone you want, then find or develop a better one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Until then I am sticking with what I got. A great phone for my needs that few match and a couple of nice tablets.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    December is running out of days fast and I still haven’t written my annual review of things I planned or did, intentionally or otherwise. I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but couldn’t find words to express myself. Finally I gave up. I don’t think I’ll succeed now, but I doubt more time would help.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For me this year has been absolutely wonderful. Coming to
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta"&gt;
     Zemanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    meant I could work on interesting problems to improve a tool I use myself while collaborating with people I like and respect. I traveled to more conferences than ever before and generally learned a lot. I’m proud of my team’s achievements and of what we did as a company. It is indeed a privilege to have a gig like this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve also started a private project with a friend, which is coming along nicely. It shouldn’t be too long before we can show it to, well, everyone interested. Hopefully that means to many.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In all, 2008 was great for me and I don’t think 2009 will be worse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet of late I’ve been feeling increasingly gloomy. This has remarkably little to do with economic crisis, influence of which we can already feel even if it’s yet to hit with full force. I won’t be traveling as much next year, but I planned to do less of it even before I knew there might be economic reasons to do so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been worrying about the state of our planet for years. Things weren’t getting better as quickly as I thought they should. In fact, they aren’t getting better at all, but I hoped we would turn and do what needs to be done when given last chance.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are many things that are deeply wrong in this world. Slavery
    &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/slavery-worse-than-ever"&gt;
     is more widespread
    &lt;/a&gt;
    than probably ever. We know we should reduce the amount of CO
    &lt;sub&gt;
     2
    &lt;/sub&gt;
    in atmosphere, yet
    &lt;a href="http://www.mnp.nl/en/publications/2008/GlobalCO2emissionsthrough2007.html"&gt;
     we do opposite
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Fisheries around world are rapidly
    &lt;a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0918-hance_fish.html"&gt;
     collapsing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    taking whole ecosystems with them. Glaciers
    &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/10/poznan-brazil-climate-change-environment"&gt;
     are receding
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with probably disastrous effect on water supplies for millions of people. Rising world population will continue to negate any progress we may have. I
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7780040.stm"&gt;
     could go on
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but this list is depressing enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After all it’s not the scale or number of challenges that
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7786910.stm"&gt;
     is dispiriting
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s our
    &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/12/greenpolitics-poznan"&gt;
     inability to act
    &lt;/a&gt;
    decisively. We prefer compromises that set targets too low and then
    &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2008/12/when_targets_miss_the_point.html"&gt;
     fail to meet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    them. There are 6.5 billion of us, but we are still unable to face real probability that this may be too many. I sometimes wonder how lives looked like in last days of civilizations long gone, most of them disappearing precisely because they taxed their environment too much. I hope I’m wrong and never find out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wished to end this post on a positive note, but I’m clearly failing. I do sincerely wish everyone happy holidays and the best of luck in next year. I’m afraid we’ll need it.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I use
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://gmail.com" rel="homepage" title="Gmail"&gt;
     Gmail
    &lt;/a&gt;
    mainly for reading mailing lists. I’m old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control it, but otherwise I can’t fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can’t). Go to the Lab tab in settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type is:unread in search box and confirm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists unread messages. It’s not perfect though. It won’t show you how many messages are unread and you can’t subscribe to it through
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Message Access Protocol"&gt;
     IMAP
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other thing that is not perfect is
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://docs.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google Docs"&gt;
     Google Docs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which I quite like. I did encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I imagine it might be in not too distant future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    How do you move documents between accounts?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it seems I can’t transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is not only not obvious, but also doesn’t work all the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would love to hear them.

    I’m back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn’t publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are places where I’ve been, places where I wouldn’t like to go again and places like
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="wikipedia" title="Namibia"&gt;
     Namibia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , where you ask yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country and its fantastic people, so I won’t even try where so many have failed before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn’t miss it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia. Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3 letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be good.
   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    End of December is a time when I usually try to take stock of year behind and create semi-plausible goals for upcoming year. I didn’t used to do this until some day, a few years ago, I noticed that my twenties were gone. Since then it has become a habit that has served me well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My biggest achievement this year is successfully suing myself. If this sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. It would take too long to explain why I came to do this, but it goes to show how far you sometimes have to go to please some bureaucrat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I worked a lot, to the point of postponing all my last years plans and didn’t get much in return. I honestly can’t say I learned a lot and I achieved even less of what I’m proud of. This year has simply been a professional disappointment that I have no intention of repeating again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course I didn’t just wake up and discover my failures and failings. They’ve been apparent to me for a while and I spent a large part of last few months thinking about what interests me and what I want, can and will try to do. I tried to form my
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , but failing to get specific enough I have decided to spend next year learning about and exploring my areas of interest and see what I can come up with.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Creating content, while popular, still feels awkward and limited. As a
    &lt;a href="http://www.lego.com" title="Greatest toys ever"&gt;
     LEGO
    &lt;/a&gt;
    fan since childhood I want to see if I can come up with a set of metaphors and building blocks that yield great power of expression. The point isn’t a tool for a perfect expression of an idea as much as it is an adequate expression of most ideas. Polishing can and should come later.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I got Beautiful Evidence by
    &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/"&gt;
     Edward Tufte
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a few days ago and it’s an astonishing book covering another topic I feel needs more (of my) attention. When we manage to create something, we often fail to present our ideas properly. Partly it’s our fault since we can’t help ourselves not to rely on forms and traditions that came before web. It’s also our tools fault. When all you have is a blog, everything has to be squeezed onto a timeline.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’re over-focusing on primary creations. As a reader I’m usually quite limited in what I can do with a piece. These days I can make a vague statement with voting or less vague one with a comment. I may also forward a find, but that’s about it. My actions are by and large limited to statements about a piece instead of interacting directly with it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m sure none of above mentioned problems is new or unexplored. Smart people out there have certainly done wonderful stuff I haven’t heard of yet. Any pointers are always welcome. So next year I’ll work less, learn more (about it) and spend time playing with ideas that might appear. Hopefully I’ll have something to show in year’s time. Who knows, with a bit of luck I might even have something useful.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But before I leave, let me wish everyone merry holidays and a happy new year.

    I’m writing this post 10 or 11, depending on how you count, days A.i. (after iPhone). Phone-phobic heathen that I am, I would prefer to have an
    &lt;a href="http://www.openmoko.org/"&gt;

    ,
    &lt;a href="http://www.openmoko.com/"&gt;
     mobile computer
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is also a phone, than the other way around.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Alas, there’s no point in purchase when there is no free time to do the hacking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No free time also means forgetting self-imposed deadline for rewriting this blog and having to put up with it for quite some time longer. That is, if there will also be enough time to do some writing. For better or worse I am not giving up hope on that yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hopefully some of my ideas will crop up in what I am secretly doing at work right now even if it won’t be really what I wanted to do in the first place. It won’t be worse, just different.

    I added Google ads (again), but with a bit of a twist. They can be seen only on posts at least two months old, so they don’t annoy my few regular readers and are seen only by fly-by visitors, who’ll never return again. Since they are the same people who come to this site by searching for something, it’s also more likely that ads will be beneficial to them. So in a way we all win or at least nobody loses (much). If you think the idea sounds too good to be mine, well, you’re right. It isn’t. It’s
    &lt;a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Jun/1/ads/#comments"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    I also admit to writing misleading title for this post. There are no connections between those three words or at least not in this article, but wouldn’t it be great, if all university students in Slovenia were required to write 3 new wikipedia articles in their final year? By then they should certainly be qualified and experienced enough to meet the level of your average wikipedia post and it wouldn’t add much to their workload.

    It’s getting more and more horrible to travel around with planes. Senseless airport rules or those which benefit only airport employees can still get me angry even days after return home. These days I wouldn’t dare to change planes at Heathrow unless I had at least two hours to do so and would need at least 3 hours not to be nervous about it. Still, there’s a positive side to it. It makes coming through the home door a happier event.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Somehow I don’t mind the actual waiting at the airport. On our last trip we, my wife and I, waited several hours for our next flight which gave us ample time to sit in cafeterias and observe functioning of an airport.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We watched couple of men loading luggage on a plane and unsurprisingly they didn’t handle suitcases gently. Our fairly new samsonite is a witness that this is quite common and I don’t expect it to last for more than a few more years unless we reduce amount of traveling we do. Still, I was astonished to see how far they can throw big heavy suitcases. It certanly can’t be good for their backs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looking at flying luggage got me thinking. Wouldn’t it be better if the whole process of loading and unloading bags could be mostly if not completely automated?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It could be done the same way as it was done with ship containers. Just standardize a few sizes in which all suitcases would come and build airplane cargo areas that take those sizes into an account. I believe you could handle most luggage completely automatically and use human gorillas only for pieces that don’t fit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You could also stimulate adoption with appropriate weight or pricing benefits for those who would use such luggage. This way we’d all win. Or is there something I’m missing?

     this article
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Tomaž interesting. And since I keep being asked what I think of Macs as well, I’ll unwisely share a few of my thoughts on the subject. But before I proceed, I’d like to state as a regular Linux/Windows/Mac/Symbian user:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “All operating systems suck. A lot. They just suck in their own special ways.”
    &lt;a href="#macs-1"&gt;
     &lt;sup&gt;
      [1]
     &lt;/sup&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Keywords being ALL, SUCK and A LOT. You just have to find the one that sucks least for what you want to do. The flip side to this is that all of them have useful features, some of which I wish other operating systems had too. You can get work done, albeit with some degree of pain, with any of them. So it’s not all bad either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In this home, we have way too many computers and my dear wife, if you’re reading this, I deeply apologize for this.  I’m working on slimming them down, but this is harder to do for a geek than keeping weight during Christmas. Anyway, if my counting is not off, then there are between 7 and 10 computers in this house, depending on how big and powerful the thing has to be to qualify. Two of them are now a bit dated macs running Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A short, unordered and incomplete list of things that I dislike about Mac or just disagree with Tomaž:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Mac software certainly has install wizards, but it’s true they are not as common as on Windows. Still, nice when they are absent.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     My powerbook is the most moody piece of hardware I ever had. If I want to reduce the risk of a crash at wake up, I have to reproduce the state at which it was put to sleep as close as possible. Still, this gets me from a wake-up crash almost every time to a crash or two per month.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I’m sure the problem lies with my particular specimen, but if Apple’s diagnostic software can’t find the problem, then it doesn’t exist as far as Apple is concerned.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Living in Slovenia means that if it does find the problem or the computer breaks down, then you’ll be likely without a computer for about 4 weeks while it’s getting shipped around Europe and repaired; I wouldn’t buy a computer that I can miss for such a long period of time. I wish I knew this when I bought mine.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Closing application window doesn’t close application itself. Except when it does.
    &lt;/li&gt;

     Hiding application (cloverleaf-H) is a neat way to hide an application, when it works. At least once a week I jettison my Safari windows and tabs because it doesn’t always work.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     For some reason it keeps offering me czech keyboard layout and funnily, it did this just now. I might have understood turkish, on account of my surname, but czech?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Slovenian keyboard layout is simply wrong. Originality is all fine and dandy, but this is not a place to differentiate yourself.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     A complete uninstall of an application which includes user settings is a tedious and error prone affair. Wouldn’t be a problem if the Library directory didn’t tend to balloon to absurd proportion through the years.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Machine seems getting progressively slower with same software as time marches on. It’s not the only system that suffers this fate, but it’s also true that not all of them do. These days using Safari on my Powerbook is an exercise in patience.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Finder, Mac’s file manager, is an abomination. It was probably great when it was conceived, but we don’t punch cards anymore.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Once a week I decline installation of iTunes 7. I’ve been doing this for months, since there’s no option to stop bugging me with this forever. I guess I’ll be doing this for months or years, until this machine dies or I start declining iTunes 8.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Proprietary formats are pure evil when there are reasonable alternatives and Mac is littered with them. iPhoto is an untrustworthy piece of crap that ate my (meta)data and blurs images when rotating. Mark
     &lt;a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks"&gt;
      was (is)
     &lt;/a&gt;
     still right.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short, Mac just works, except when it doesn’t or when it stops. Having said that it might be the perfect computer for you, even though it’s clearly not for me.
   &lt;/p&gt;

Same goes for any sort of provocations not committed by the author with this post. Verbal abuse of me is fine, but abuse of other commentators will get you in a trash bin.

    It’s been more than a month since I got my Nokia 770. In that time, I went through numerous spontaneous reboots, which culminated in one never ending reboot loop after an unsuccessful software install in which I lost my Mahjong best times and a collection of ideas for a project at work. I can’t make it connect to company wireless (although at home it works just fine) and built in email client is a piece of crap that barely satisfies the need to check email. There’s no good way to synchronize data (address book etc.) with other devices and I see no reason why included editor can’t handle any text file.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yet, I absolutely love this gadget to the point, where my wife jokes about being jealous.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about this ever since I flashed the device yesterday. Why is it so alluring to me?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Gadgets are not living beings and there’s no charm in their faults. There certainly are many of them, but there’s also a lot to like. Display is fantastic and reading web pages or pdf files finally doesn’t hurt. Those two tasks were the reason I bought it in the first place, so it’s performing its main function quite well. I like the way I can transform it in a little computer with a portable bluetooth keyboard
    &lt;br/&gt;
    that lets me do practically anything. I don’t play games much, but I like those available. I was fine with declared battery time and I’m
    &lt;br/&gt;
    absolutely delighted my 770 like a Duracell bunny easily exceeds it. I’ve got a feeling I can make it do whatever I want, limited mostly by my practically non-existent free time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess I like it so much simply because getting more than expected is good enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    There’s hardly a worse way to end a vacation than catching a flu. There are also better starts to flu then midnight spells of vomiting, when your stomach is completely empty. All you do is spit acid and brush teeth afterwards in hope they might stick around a bit longer.

    &lt;br/&gt;
    This vacation has been very much unlike the others. It was the first time in years, well, since I started working really, that I didn’t work at all while being on vacation. I didn’t think of work either, an odd experience I enjoyed with gusto.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Still, a long way home provided ample opportunity for reflection, hazy thoughts and dubious decisions one of which is that I’m going to rewrite this site and create my own publishing platform, which will be better suited than those known to me for things I need and things I’d like to try out.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I’ve also given myself a deadline, a year, in which to come up with this thing. A deadline that I think provides enough time to hope for sucess and not enough to slack.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    What won’t change is the low frequency of my posts, a belief strengthened by wading through hundreds of unread posts accumulated in my feed reader while I was gone, majority of which being little more than a waste of time. But who am I to complain.

    I need help. I’m looking to expand my horizons, learn something new and generally make positive and decisive steps to being less ignorant. I’d be most grateful, if you could help me, dear reader, by pointing out interesting and useful resources out there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The topics are not really important. I may be biased to deepening my knowledge of history and design, but every topic and more importantly, every resource is a good one as long as you personally find it interesting and it’s accessible to neophytes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is an exception to this. Resources about software and software development should be avoided unless they cover the field from a completely original point of view or were created by an author, who is raving mad. I’d prefer both, but later requirement probably already includes former.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I don’t care about the form either as long as it’s fairly accessible. Books, blogs, podcasts, movies etc. are all fair game, but conferences with couple of thousand dollars entrance fees (or organized in USA) aren’t.

    Today is this blog’s first anniversary. I posted my first post after I came back from last year’s
    &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia/"&gt;
     @media
    &lt;/a&gt;
    conference, which is where I’m going tomorrow. I’m sure it will be even better than last year, but I somehow don’t look forward to it. I got used to traveling with my wife and lost the lust for going solo.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In this year I wrote 176 posts (not including this one) or almost one every two days. A lot and certainly too many for them all to be worth reading. I hope at least some of them have been.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Reliable statistics are a bitch. I installed different packages at various times, each using their own approach to tracking, which produced lots of numbers of dubious quality. Still, for the interested few, this blog has been accessed by more than 12 thousand individuals at least 23 thousand times. Counting all visits including feed update checks, 116 thousand visits resulted in more than 264 thousand generated pages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Majority of visitors didn’t come from Slovenia (only 25.8%), so it was probably not a stupid idea to write this blog in English even if my countrymen read above average number of pages per visit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m completely humbled by the amount of time that was spent reading or scanning this blog, even if each visitor spent only a second on it. I hope it was worth it and that most of them don’t miss that second. I’m even more amazed that some of you liked it enough to subscribe to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since summaries like this are far more fun to write than to read, I’ll end this one and make it the last. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you again.

     keyboards
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or monitors in Slovenia. I hate it almost as much as buying clothes, although looking for decent clothes is usually less futile.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We need to replace a monitor, which developed an affection for pink, so we went out to find a replacement. A 19″ or larger LCD monitor with decent picture would do nicely. Surely a reasonable expectation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems you can get anything you want as long as what you want has a picture that is either misty, has shadow or has a glossy enough screen to see yourself clearly in it even when turned on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since nothing was worth buying, we bought nothing. I actually don’t mind that they mostly sell cheap crap, if that is what is selling. But it is hard to imagine that there are so few people looking for decent monitors not to warrant at least one or two decent models on display.

    This blog and other content of less dubious nature were inaccessible in last three days. A freak, previously unseen and therefore unforeseen scenario happened where two disks forming RAID-1, which haven’t shown a single sign of a problem, suddenly died simultaneously. As has been noted, a million to one chance scenarios crop up 9 times out of 10, so firm steps have been taken to prevent something like this from occurring ever again.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve also rediscovered how I detest system administration and I’m happy to have competent friends to absolve me from it. I used to earn a part of my salary doing such work, which reminds me a lot of the war. Prolonged periods of preparations and shear boredom are pierced with short episodes full of adrenaline and occasionally terror of a fuck-up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another lesson form another unexpected discovery. I missed my blog as much as I did my email. A sad discovery indeed, showing I don’t prefer listening over talking as much as I should. However, there’s a silver lining in knowing that I haven’t longed for either too much.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is it. Everything should be back to normal, but if you find a dead link or something not working quite as it should, I’d appreciate a line or two describing the problem.

    But we get spam that drives me nuts, because it’s something that could be permanently fixed. You see, ALL of our trackback spam is directed to the same blog post. So, if I could turn trackback off only on that post, it would cut our spam to more than a half and leave my nerves intact.

    This has been bugging me ever since I’ve heard a podcast of Vinod Khosla at Web 2.0 conference a couple of days ago, who touched on a theme that seems to crop up in Slovenia every now and then. He said something along the lines of there’s less need for teaching facts to children today, because they can find them online. Instead they should learn how to think critically and how to sort through information.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No arguement from me about the thinking and sorting part. They are skills definitely needed today more than ever, which seem to be sorely lacking in many, if not most people. Improving them can only be better for them and society as a whole.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I disagree strongly about the need to teach facts though. Current approach to teach them may be wrong, but if anything, we know too few and not too many of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First problem is that you need to know something to be able to ask a question at all. If I take the title question as an example, there are three keywords in it: dutch, painter and diplomat. Dropping any of them would probably lead to a different result and likely never to the same one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The less we know, less questions we can dare to ask. Without facts, there’ll be less we’ll be able to imagine. Ideas are not something that comes from a thin air. They are offspring of the things we already know. They may be a descendant of a previous idea, but if we trace it back far enough we’ll sooner or later find an ancestor which will be a fact.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We might also know enough to get by in our every day life, but in a society where creativity is growing in importance, it’s probably not enough. Knowledge is the soil on which creativity grows. Richer the soil, richer its crop.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What we know doesn’t only limit to what we can aspire, it also defines who we already are. It’s easy to think of knowledge as something that can be separated into useful and useless. Useful being any piece of knowledge that we get to directly apply at least now and then (like basic arithmetics or driving a car) or clairvoyantly know we’ll need some day and useless being everything else. It’s easy and it’s wrong.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We were molded by whole of it, not just with the parts we happen to like or use. We can’t desire what we don’t know and it’s easier to fear unknown. What we know is largely who we are.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve spent most of my life learning as much as I can about as many subjects as possible; about some of them even very deeply. But I wonder if I’ll ever stop feeling being an ignoramus. Acknowledging the limits of personal knowledge and wisdom isn’t an absolution from its pursuit. And it should never be one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    P.S: The answer to the question in this post title is Peter Paul Rubens. I’d like to know enough to tell if he’s the only one.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    This year’s first snow fell couple of days ago and while I enjoy it immensely, I’m getting more and more annoyed by our snowplowers.
    &lt;a class="imageR" href="/images/firstsnow.jpg"&gt;
     &lt;img alt="First snow" src="/images/firstsnow_small.jpg"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Snowplowing in Slovenia is a state provided service without any business competition and like most such services it sucks. In fact, we relive the same story every year:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     some time in the fall there’s a story published, how everyone is ready for snow this year and there won’t be any problems with our roads
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     we get a correct weather forecast a few days before the first snow
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     snow falls, plowers are nowhere to be seen and there’s a complete mayhem on slovenian roads
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     snowplowers provide some meaningless statistics about resources used and journalists write stories about how they were surprised by the snow
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now, could you treat your customers and users like this? Probably not.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Except if you, like them, are the only provider of vital service. It’s probably still a poor business strategy because even if you are, like telecoms used to be, can you be absolutely sure that this will remain so?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I’d just like to know how is it possible fo them not to be embarrassed infront of their family and friends.

    Ever since I created my first blog, comment spam was an ever present evil. I can imagine it must be really annoying on very popular blogs with lots of comments, but the variety I have is more puzzling than anything else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What’s the purpose of producing spam comments that can’t pass even a simple filter included in default installation of WordPress?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find it highly incredible that someone would be competent enough to write a spamming software and incompetent enough to avoid the only trap WordPress presents. Or is there a benefit to blog spam no one else but me sees?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are other problems with it that make it easy to recognize and handle it. I’m grateful, because I don’t have to annoy anyone with captchas or other comment preventing mechanisms.

   &lt;p&gt;
    I get a feeling sometimes, that most blogs are an outlet for people to complain about something. I know I do it more often than I’d like to. I’ll do it less, but this post is another rant.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lately, whenever I read or hear anyone mentioning Apple, my blood starts boiling. Reason for this is quite simple; today is a two-month anniversary since I took my broken iMac to local Apple service and it’s also the day when they let me know, they got another broken motherboard from Apple so they can’t tell me when they’ll be able to fix it. But they can give me my money back.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would be awful even if this was the only time I ever had a problem with Apple. Sadly it isn’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can understand that every manufacturing line produces a certain percentage of faulty products. I might accept, unwillingly,  that Apple products on whole fail less often than competition and that it’s just my bad luck that got me a faulty computer. But this hardly matters, if you have no real idea when they’ll be fixed, when they actually do break.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think it’s far better for me, as a user, to have a product that fails twice as often, but which can be and more importantly, will be fixed in a couple of days, then something that presumably almost never fails, but when it does, it might take an unspecified number of months before you’ll get it fixed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, I’m quite certain I won’t be buying anything hardware related from Apple anytime soon. I have to decide if this includes getting rid of this iMac or not. Getting rid of it means I’ll probably won’t get my data back and I certainly won’t finish a couple of projects.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other dilemma is what to say, when friends ask me about Apple products, which every now and then they do. I had a good experience with my local Apple reseller (more or less Apple only shop)  and would like to recommend them, but it’s impossible for me to recommend products they are selling. Truth may set me free.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I wish Linux had a better video and photo editing software. It’s the only area I can think of where it doesn’t actually exceed my expectations.

    It turns out Apple introduced new
    &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" title="Link to Apple iPod page"&gt;
     iPod
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,

     iMac
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and iTunes too. Video watching is in. Now you can watch video on your iPod and you can buy (if you have access to iTunes USA store) episodes of ABC’s popular shows, but in ridiculously small format (320×240).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Personally, I doubt I’ll be buying anything made by Apple anytime soon. My iMac still hasn’t been repaired and I have no idea when it will be. I wouldn’t have spare macs lying around even if I could afford it and this makes them more or less unusable to me for professional work.

    Why is it that we still celebrate national sport teams as demigods and cheer a bunch of guys (or gals) only because they come from the right part of a planet?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Slovenia was caught in a basketball euphoria when it looked for a while that it might actually win a medal. Personally, I have no beef with people playing it. I haven’t done it in a while, but I used to enjoy it a lot. I don’t mind people watching basketball or any other sport either. I rarely do, but I do recognize inherent drama and sometimes amazing display of mastery.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also don’t mind cheering in general. We’ve all encountered individuals or teams, who exemplified rare qualities we admire and wished them best luck. I do find it a bit repulsive to cheer for a person or a team just because they come from the right town or a country.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It seems rather primitive to pick a side mainly because of nationality or locality; as if our nationality is itself a quality worthy of admiration and pride. They are our lot, our tribe, and that makes them better?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Is it then a wonder that after all this time and relative progress we still have so much troubles with each other? If intimate human relationships can’t survive feelings of personal superiority, how can it ever happen with nations?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve always been attached to this place where I grew up and culture that shaped me to who I am today and I can’t imagine giving it up. But long gone are days when I felt the same about my nationality and I’d be ashamed if they came back.

    I was reading Roger Johansson’s blog and came to a
    &lt;a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/"&gt;
     post
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting"&gt;
     top-posting
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     &amp;gt; Because it messes up the flow of reading.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Why is replying about quotations annoying?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Could you please stop with that? I don’t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it’s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn’t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
     &lt;list&gt;
      archives proves this.
     &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     It’s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it’s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can’t be a reason to howl down somebody.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don’t think I’m a lesser being for it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    I thought Harold Evans’
    &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language"&gt;
     last column
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was quite good.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s no shocking revelation that I’m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I’d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I’ve used for more than three decades.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I’m sure I still make mistakes like this.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there’s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you’re talking about and not well enough to actually do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?

    I’ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I’ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it’s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Customer relationship management.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you’re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I’m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There’s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn’t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it’s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Why is this so hard for others to learn?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    We’ve been working with a talented group of designers, whose work I admired for a long time, on a design for our new service. Initial concept was exactly what we were looking for and the only changes that needed to be made, were consequences of our bad choices earlier on. In fact, everything was great except one thing.

    We didn’t like proposed color schemes.

Sure, they’ve always been graceful (at least the good designers), but I’m certain they wouldn’t mind spiking a voodoo doll of me, given a chance.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    So, Google
    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/talk"&gt;
     has an IM
    &lt;/a&gt;
    now. Nice that they are using Jabber, but it would be even nicer if their server talked to others too. Otherwise this is just another walled garden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    True, there’s an offer to federate with others, but this makes as much sense as having connection agreements between email servers. If they want a really open IM, then they should let their server work as Jabber was designed. Everyone can play and set up their own server.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On a different note, does anyone know of a good open source Jabber server that can actually handle 10k simultaneous connections and doesn’t go crazy every now and then?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update: According to

      Joe Beda
     &lt;/a&gt;
     there are 3 reasons for staying close:
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Missing code needed for interoperability.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     They want to develop abuse/spam countermeasures.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     They want to ensure everybody really talks to everybody.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can certainly sympathize with first reason, if true (and I have no reason to doubt it). But it’s harder to agree with other two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You already have a contact authorization to limit such behavior. If this is not enough, the correct way would be to be as open as a lot of Jabber servers are and switch on protective measures after you’ve developed them together with Jabber community.

    It also shouldn’t be up to Google to dictate how open other providers should be. That decision should be left with administrators of Jabber servers and they shouldn’t be coerced into Google’s policy. Basically they should keep the same freedom email server administrators enjoy right now.

    I’m usually quite fond of weekends. There’s never a good reason for it, since they’ve looked like normal working days for quite some months now. But the feeling of a time off still lingers and I’m usually happy when it’s Friday.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m also quite happy that there are only few more hours of this hellish weekend, when nothing went right. Among other things, I got so exhausted  that I slept straight for almost 12 hours (personal record) and I got acquainted really well with spinning wheel on my Powerbook. Probable cause: dying disk at time when that’s least needed. One more thing made by Apple (beside iMac and iPod) that I need to take to service when I get around to it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, not much work has been done in last few days and I won’t be able to finish even what I promised to do.  This never fails to annoy me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have been thinking, while strolling around lake,  about when to reveal our very buzzword compliant service to the greater public. Is the right time when it’s finally useful, but still obviously inspired by other services found on web or is it better to wait half a year or so,  when it will gain the really interesting parts?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I still think the right time is this autumn, even though this will lead to accusations of plagiarism. At this point they won’t be really unfounded even if I believe we are just borrowing ideas from others to build something interesting and different (hopefully somebody will someday return the compliment).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, it would be good  to see how others react to what we build and to fix things now  when this can be done more easily then if we wait longer. I also learned the importance of releasing things to keep developers motivated and at least somewhat happy. Nobody likes to be completely irrelevant.  At last, there’s also the ever present problem of money.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If anybody actually gets around to reading this, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this subject. What do you prefer, big bang revelation or evolution of service?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    Back from Ireland, a place everyone should visit at least once. If you have time, take a few days to explore Dublin and travel to west coast. Those like me, who find abundance of national pride and flags creepy, might skip Northern Ireland.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    New development posts might take few days to appear, while I catch up with everything.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    This is a first post on my new development oriented blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I returned from @media2005 yesterday, where I got the feeling that either you have a blog on which you share your thoughts and possible insights or you have no good way to join the discussion except few times a year on conferences like the last one, which certainly can’t be and isn’t enough.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore I decided to make a new start, this time in English and about subjects where I might have a bit more interesting things to say than what happened to my non-existant cat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, welcome to anyone who happened to come to this place and I hope you’ll find it at least mildly useful, if not entertaining.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
