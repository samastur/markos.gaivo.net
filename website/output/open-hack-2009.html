        <div class="post-text">
            <p>Now that Mini Seedcamp in Ljubljana is behind me (an event that might
warrant its own post), I finally have some time to write about <a href="http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/FrontPage">Open
Hack 2009</a>. I'm sorry to
say to those who didn't go that this might have been the biggest mistake
you'll do this year. It was indeed awesome. Before I go on I would also
like to thank people at Yahoo for really pulling no stops in making it
great and to everyone who came, for being inspiring, helpful and
generally fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> and I made two hacks, a
website <a href="http://guesswhatthisis.appspot.com/">GuessWhatThisIs</a> based on
an idea we brought to event (but no code), and a game
<a href="http://friedcell.net/geopong/">GeoPong</a> that Fry thought of in wee
hours of Sunday. GeoPong, best described as "<a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/05/11/open-hack-london-2009-my-presentation-and-quick-review/" title="Link to quote">a quite irrelevant but
lovely
hack</a>",
doesn't always work great (especially on non-FF browsers), nevertheless
I am still amazed that we managed to build both, because we essentially
did GuessWhatThisIs twice. Wifi didn't work until later in the evening,
so we built first version of the site with pieces of software we had on
our machines an educated guess about APIs we needed but couldn't access.</p>
<p>Event was thoroughly documented on Flickr, Twitter and plethora of other
websites, so I won't dwell much on that. Instead I'll mention couple of
observations that albeit not new, I still found interesting.</p>
<p>First one is that team is absolutely everything. You can certainly do
interesting stuff alone, but things really start happening if you have a
good team. Working with talented and fun people mean ideas get fleshed
out sooner, there's little coordination and more things get done. If on
top they are like Fry, who like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell_Bunny">Duracell
Bunny</a> just seems to keep
going, you can finish projects you certainly would not otherwise.</p>
<p>Hackday also provided another proof that all-nighters as development
method are an idiotic idea. Most hackers, who certainly didn't lack
enthusiasm, fell asleep at some point during the night and those, like
us, who didn't, slowly fried our brains. Development slowed down to a
glacial speed, code written was frankly embarassing and help was needed
to resolve most basic problems. We spent more than 4 hours on GeoPong
which normally shouldn't take us more than half of one. Even worse from
efficiency point of view was that Monday was gone too. All-nighter can
be a fun thing to do once in a while, but it is really a crappy way to
run a business.</p>
<p>At the end a small advice to organizers for next European event, on
which I hope we won't have to wait another two years. Try putting as
much documentation and libraries on USB key as you can, so in case of
wifi not working, we can still program with them instead of falling back
to what we already intimately know or have on our machines.</p>
