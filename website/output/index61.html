                <p>First part of AJAX workshop is behind me and I enjoyed it immensely. I
hope our participants did as well or failing that, I hope we didn't
waste their time too much.</p>
<p>Looking back I'm not satisfied with everything we did and I wish I've
done my part better. I'm sure I wasn't clear or coherent enough. Fry did
much better, but I feel we could do better with examples.</p>
<p>If we ever repeat this workshop, and we both would love to, we'll have
to make it longer, since there simply wasn't enough time to talk about
the details and quirks that can and usually do waste majority of your
time.</p>
<p>If you were there yesterday, then please drop me a line or two about
your experience. I'd also love to hear what you want from second part of
the workshop, since it's not too late to change it to suit you better.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I tried to leave a comment on <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> recently and
had trouble deciphering its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a>. I was eventually
successful, but only after I got annoyed. Simply put, CAPTCHAs are evil.</p>
<p>There's no need to rehash why, since
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+accessibility">plenty</a> has been
said so far. They <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">don't</a> really work
and they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Accessibility">exclude</a>
lots of people even if you do use an alternative audio check. As a
left-handed person, who curses every time he picks up an "ergonomically"
designed scissors, I kind of imagine how it is when things are designed
for a majority you don't belong to.</p>
<p>However, even if you could make them completely accessible (doubtful)
and would somehow be able to resolve the overlap between smartest
programs and, well, less-gifted humans (impossible), I'd still dislike
them. What they say to your readers is: "I'll make you work so I don't
have to."</p>
<p>Is this the message you want to communicate?</p>
<p>P.S: WordPress users, you really ought to take a look at
<a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, if you haven't done so.</p>

                <p>I think it was Jon Udell who gave the advice to include information
about author and date of publication in the title tag of each document.
I think it's a smashing idea, but I have a problem.</p>
<p>I have no clue how to do it in WordPress. It seems every WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags#Date_and_Time_tags">date
or title
tag</a> wants
to reside inside of its loop and document title is firmly outside of it.
Anyone have any ideas?</p>
