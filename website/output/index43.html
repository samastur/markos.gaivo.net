                <p>I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who's a recent Python convert
and he was explaining to me which parts of Python are not to his liking.
Mostly he had reasonable objections.</p>
<p>I can understand his wish for strong typing, but since lack of it is not
a problem that affected me yet, I'm not bothered by it. I'll take his
word that objects pickled on Windows are not transferable to Linux and
that certainly can suck. But it was probably the smallest problem that
resonated the strongest with me, since it was something that has annoyed
me previously.</p>
<p>Bisect module doesn't let you specify comparison function. It obviously
doesn't need to, since you can define your own comparison methods on
your classes, but still, it would be nice if its documentation included
a hint for those who won't look at module's code or think of simply
trying. You know, people like me.</p>
<p>It got me thinking that I don't find all modules in standard library of
the same quality and I suspect I'm not the only one. I don't mean to or
honestly can disparage anyone, since I haven't seen any code in standard
library that would be worse than mine.</p>
<p>Still, which modules do you think would benefit from some work and how
could an eager person, with some time on his hands, help them improve?</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Dear LazyWeb,</p>
<p>I'm looking for a shop that sells <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/770" title="Tablet's homepage">Nokia 770 Internet
Tablet</a> and is willing
to ship it for a reasonable fee to Slovenia. Our <a href="http://www.teleray.si/" title="Official Slovenian Nokia distributor">official Nokia
distributor</a>
has failed me miserably in this regard.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Update (22.12.2006):</strong> Expansys managed to deliver navigation kit
without the tablet. Hopefully this problem will be amicably resolved
after holidays (since nobody could be reached yesterday afternoon).</p>
<p><strong>Update (29.12.2006):</strong> Tablet arrived today and man, do I love this
little machine already.</p>

                <p><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=210#postcomment">Simon</a> proposes using
a dictionary to match mistyped URLs with real ones. I'd probably like
the idea better if I actually understood it. Still using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" title="description of the algorithm">Levenshtein</a>
can be a bit easier than using a spell checker responsively.</p>
<p>Easier, but slow. I used existing
<a href="http://hetland.org/python/distance.py" title="python implementation">implementation</a>
by Magnus Lie Hetland and made a test with 245 blog titles using a
simple
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/distance/test_distance" title="Link to test script">script</a>.
100 iterations on aging powerbook produced:</p>
<p>1.766s, 29.152s, 9.399s (min, max, avg)</p>
<p>Average time to calculate distance between randomly chosen title and
rest of them is 9.4 seconds, which is far too much to be useful. And
there's not even 250 of them.</p>
<p>There are two obvious ways to speed things up. Since minimum distance is
at least as much as a difference in length of both strings, there's no
point in calculating it when difference already exceeds a limit we
chose.</p>
<p>The other trick took into an account that Levenshtein's algorithm of two
strings of comparable length has complexity of O(n2) and that my blog
titles are form quite sparse space. If strings are longer than a certain
limit (I arbitrarily chose 10 letters), then first calculate edit
distance on a small sparse substring and then calculate the real
distance only if first one was close enough.</p>
<p>When I made 1000 iterations of randomly chosen title using only first
test, I got following results:</p>
<p>0.003s, 0.284s, 0.167s (min, max, avg)</p>
<p>However, if I used both checks, the same 1000 iteration test got me:</p>
<p>0.003s, 0.162s, 0.027s (min, max, avg)</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/distance/distance.py" title="Extended distance functions">two simple
checks</a>
can speed up search up to 350 times. Not bad, but I'm not happy. This is
certainly fast enough for a personal website or sites where site
structure effectively divides searching to relatively small sets of
possible hits, but there are plenty of sites where it would be too slow.</p>
<p>I tried to simplify searching using distance to map strings to
coordinate system, which was at least hopelessly naive if not downright
dumb. A much better approach would be to read more, which is what I'm
doing now.</p>
<p>By the way, I've also tried to speed it up using Pyrex, but got pretty
much same results, which means I either don't know how to use Pyrex or
Python optimizes well. Or both.</p>
