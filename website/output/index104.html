                <p>I thought Harold Evans' <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language">last
column</a>
was quite good.</p>
<p>It's no shocking revelation that I'm not a native English speaker. In
fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to
master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be
desired, I'd like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a
misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly
different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily
spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language
I've used for more than three decades.</p>
<p>However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using
English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might
use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but
not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase
between languages, but I'm sure I still make mistakes like this.</p>
<p>I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them
probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the
language we used came between us. I came to believe there's a risk in
knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you're
talking about and not well enough to actually do.</p>
<p>So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to
share?</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Play with fire and you'll get burned.</p>
<p>I've just spent two days hunting a bug that just didn't make sense. No
matter what I did, there was at least one browser, which didn't want to
behave properly and it was driving me nuts.</p>
<p>Finally I gave up and decided there's nothing wrong with my code and the
fault must be with the browser. And so it was, up to a point. Or not,
depending on your point of view.</p>
<p>The problem was a timing conflict resulting from a use of <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=12" title="Description of technique">framestack
technique</a>
and the way modern browsers work. Browsers don't wait for the whole page
with its data to load, before they display it to users. They display as
reasonable presentation of received data as possible while they are
trying to load the rest. For example, onload handler set to body tag is
triggered when body of HTML document has loaded, but possibly before
images and other external resources have. When they do, page layout
might change somewhat and if your script is reading and using layout
data in the meantime, it's quite likely it'll end up using wrong values.</p>
<p>The easiest (and right) way to fix this is to start javascript with
<em>window.onload</em>, which is triggered when everything has loaded. This
might be a problem, if you're using something like framestack to avoid
reloading page on subsequent visits, but at least in my case I've
decided that the cleanest and easiest solution was to use window.onload
and just force reload of problematic page on each visit.</p>
<p>It's also possible to get in similar timing conflicts by using
<em>innerHTML</em> method. If you try to stuck a large piece of HTML inside a
page using innerHTML call, you may encounter an unwelcome surprise.
Reason for this is that at least some browsers don't wait to parse and
insert data in DOM before they proceed to the next statement. Injection
delay is usually barely noticeable, but big enough for statements that
manipulate inserted data to fail, if they are in close proximity to
innerHTML call.</p>
<p>You can't necessarily avoid innerHTML problems with window.onload, but
you can by using (more cumbersome) DOM methods.</p>
<p>It still annoys me though that I knew all of this and wasted two days
just because I didn't think of it.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>This is the second post on this subject. You can find the first part
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=23" title="First par of this article">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, how do latency and bandwidth relate to the speed of execution?</p>
<p>As mentioned, latency is time needed for any amount of information to
travel a certain distance and bandwidth is the amount of data that can
flow through it at the same time.</p>
<p>Let me give you a real-life example. If you imagine people walking down
the corridor, then latency is amount of time one person needs to walk
from start to its end and bandwidth is number of people who can do this
at the same time.</p>
<p>You can measure latency quite easily with ping, a tool available on
every major OS, which will give you a round-trip time from client to
server (2+5 from our original 7 intervals). The only problem is that it
will tell you just your personal latency at that time, which can vary
significantly for people on different networks and even for you at
different times. There are similar tools for measuring bandwidth and
they have more or less the same problems.</p>
<p>However, sometimes you can tell a bit about what you can expect. For
example, if you're building an application aimed at mobile users using
GPRS, then it's quite reasonable to assume that bandwidth will be scarce
and latency will be high. On local networks it's usually the opposite of
that.</p>
<p>In general, latency rises with distance between server and client and
bandwidth can't be wider than the narrowest bandwidth on the way and the
question is how do we react to our situation?</p>
<p>Basic rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>if latency is high, then we should make as few round-trips to server
    as possible</li>
<li>if bandwidth is wide, then we can transfer more data at each trip</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice we should always try for the most balanced approach between
this two factors. If latency is fairly high, but bandwidth is not
severely limited, then we might transfer also data we don't need
immediately, if it might spare us another request later on. If latency
is low and bandwidth is narrow, then it might make more sense to
transfer only what's needed, but make those requests more often.</p>
<p>Another way we can sometimes cut down response time, when bandwidth is
not the limiting factor, is to multiplex connections, which is a bit
fancy way of saying to simultaneously open multiple connections from
client to server. It's nice to keep in mind that some browsers like
Internet Explorer will limit number of simultaneous connections for HTTP
protocol to 4 (as specified by its standard), but you are more free to
do what you want, if you write your own program. It's also nice to keep
in mind that if order in which responses are coming is important, you'll
have to handle that yourself.</p>
<p>A different approach is to simulate multiplex connections over one
connection. In this case client sends multiple commands inside of one
network request and receives answers to all of them at once. It's easier
to handle order, since you get all data at the same time, but you give
up possibly faster response for some of the data.</p>
<p>There are other factors that can influence our decisions, such as
possibly increased load on server from more requests. Or the speed with
which we can generate a request and process reply, if we need to pack
and unpack more data. But this are issues worth exploring in some other
post, if interest justifies it.</p>
