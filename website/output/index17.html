            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>April is about to end and with it also the deadline to <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/">submit your
EuroPython talk</a>. I thought about
submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my
current workload.</p>
<p>It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not)
Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.</p>
<p>I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality.
It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but
they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had
to miss last year, feels like home.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to volunteer this year. It's a way to give a little
bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.</p>
<p>So do submit your talk and come. It won't be the same without you.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I admire the look and feel of <a href="http://www.mikematas.com/">Mike Matas' new
website</a>. It is really well thought through.
I was also intrigued by how he did it, especially after getting a pop-up
on my first visit advising me to use a more modern browser than a recent
version of Firefox.</p>
<p>There is no point in speculating why some of its features don't work in
more browsers. But I was surprised to see that blurred images are served
that way and don't get blurred in browser. I am playing with an idea of
implementing a gallery inspired by Mike's work, but I would like to
reduce manual labor needed for maintaining it.</p>
<p>So I wrote a function that blurs an image on canvas. You can <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/canvas_blur/" title="Javascript blur demo page">see it in
action</a>
or copy its code, if you find it useful.</p>
<p>The algorithm used is described in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060718054020/http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/siggraph/workshops/wjarosz_convolution_2001.pdf" title="Link to PDF version of paper">2001
paper</a>
by Wojciech Jarosz. Page contains two implementations, second trading
algorithm purity for in my opinion nicer code. Increase number of passes
or run it few times over an image, if you need a blurrier result.?
Please ask, if you need help with its use.</p>
<p>I also measured its speed to see if it fits my needs. That brought a new
surprise. Firefox 3.5.8? on my Linux powered VAIO with 1.2GHz processor
blurs image twice as fast as same browser on a Mac with a 2.8Ghz
processor. Numbers between runs may vary slightly, but never much. No
idea why this is happening, since all functions do is some basic math
over items in array that should be well optimized everywhere.</p>
<p>I am sure somebody can optimize it further, but I find it good enough
for my use. Image isn't very blurred after one pass, but one pass over a
small image is also a good way to measure how fast a particular
computer-browser combination is. On fast combinations I might go for
multiple passes over images in view, but fall back to a single pass or
no pass on slower systems.</p>

                <p>I am not much of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="My YouTube channel">YouTube
user</a>, but I
have recently started to upload some of my work
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="my demos on youtube">there</a>.
You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes
for products that may never be (especially if you are a
<a href="http://www.zemanta.com" title="Zemanta">Zemanta</a> user).</p>
<p>I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement
and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be
actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to
our users so please tell us what you think.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to mention that I don't lead front-end team at
Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy
way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our
users more deeply than anybody else.</p>
