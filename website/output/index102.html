                <p>Sometimes, I really am an idiot. A couple of years ago I was involved in
development of a front-end Zope application for a major Slovenian ISP
with more than 100 000 users. No matter what we did, Zope just wasn't
fast. In fact it was so slow, it was soon abandoned for one more
suitable solution.</p>
<p>The failure of our project was largely my fault, because I haven't made
sure Zope was a good fit for what we wanted. I learned a lot, but it
also left a bitter aftertaste and a question, why are people using it?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is of course, because it DOES fit their needs. It's
just that they are not building a site or an application that needs to
handle few hundred simultaneous requests. They handle a few at most, so
Zope or Plone or what-have-you is more than speedy enough and it's their
features that count.</p>
<p>It really took me awhile to grasp this and it only became really clear
this week, after reading a little <a href="http://www.larsen-b.com/Article/217.html">Plone
benchmark</a> and having a
discussion with
<a href="http://seba.antiwisdom.com" title="Sebastjan's blog">Sebastjan</a> about
slowness of Slovenian sites.</p>
<p>On a positive note, we generate pages in less than 6 ms now and can
reduce it even further, if needed.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>There's one thing that really bothers me, when it comes to design of
forms. Well, more than one really, but let's limit this discussion to
just one.</p>
<p>Submit buttons.</p>
<p>I can't stand their look, especially geek chic design of early nineties
presented in Firefox and its relatives. I guess industrial look and
Motif widgets were never really my taste. But even more pleasant design
of buttons in Safari can look out of place with some designs.</p>
<p>There's also an alternative that is often used. Image input buttons
(type=image) can provide a more pleasant look, but they have one big
disadvantage compared to submit buttons. They don't scale. Not really
something I'd want in an accessible interface.</p>
<p>I used a hardly novel
<a href="http://clagnut.com/sandbox/imagetest/" title="Clagnut's image tests">idea</a> of
defining image measurements in relative units. Browsers usually don't do
this. They lay it out in original size using absolute values. Hence,
when you change the size of fonts, the size of image stays the same. But
if you use relative units, you get desired scaling effect. It might look
like crap, but at least it can be readable for people with impaired
vision.</p>
<p>As you can see in simple
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/imgbutton/index.html">demo</a>,
experiments with em's haven't worked really well. There are two distinct
problems. First is to find the relative size that doesn't stretch an
image in either direction. Second, to do this in a cross-browser
compatible way.</p>
<p>My demo kind of works in Safari, but not really in Firefox and I have no
idea about rest of the bunch. So, has anyone solved this problem?</p>
<p><em>Update: I managed to get a better result. You can read about it
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=34">here.</a></em></p>

                <p>I apologize in advance to anyone reading this who can't understand
Slovene, but the next announcement is of very local nature and probably
of interest only to Slovene speaking people actually living in Slovenia.</p>
<p>Z oktobrom se ponovno odpirajo vrata <a href="www.kiberpipa.org">Kiberpipe</a> in
jesen prinaša novost. Spletne urice, serija rednih tedenskih predavanj o
spletu in spletnih tehnologijah namenjenih predvsem izkušenim
razvijalcem, oblikovalcem in skrbnikom, ki bi radi poglobili svoje
znanje, predstavili svoje izkušnje ali pa se preprosto sre??ali in
pogovorili z drugimi spletnimi sotrpini.</p>
<p>V sredo, 5. oktobra, ob 19.00 bo na sporedu prvo predavanje. Jure Koren
bo v predavanju z naslovom PHP v ??asu terorizma predstavil prijeme, s
katerimi se izognemo temu, da bi naša PHP aplikacija bila vstopna to??ka
za internetne vlomilce.</p>
<p>Upam, da nas bo tam ??im ve??.</p>
