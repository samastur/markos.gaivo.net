        <div class="post-text">
            <p>My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did
since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I
meant more books from authors translated into English (so not
"Anglo-saxon"). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was
a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less
satisfying picks.</p>
<p>I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago
when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus
7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with
reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The
upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they
were easily exportable and creating them wasn't such a hassle.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for
those that are at least fine. Bold is reserved for those I found best:
<em>This House, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Embers, River Town:
Two Years on Yangtze, Chimerica, Decline and Fall</em> and <em>The Fall of the
Stone City</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful
    Ideas</a>
    by Seymour Papert. A book on constructivist approach to learning
    written for educators which for me was sometimes a bit of a
    challenge. Makes a persuasive case for at least a modified approach
    to learning (wasn't won over completely) and did provide some
    intriguing possibilities for my work.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Peking-Murder-Englishwoman-Haunted/dp/0143121006">Midnight in
    Peking</a>
    by Paul French. Similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Suspicions-Mr-Whicher-Murder/dp/0747596484">The Suspicions of Mr.
    Whitcher</a>.
    A gripping, well researched story about an "unsolved" horrendous
    murder that vividly brings to life Peking long gone.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Modern-Plays-James-Graham/dp/1472507029">This
    House</a>
    by James Graham.</strong> Great and very funny drama about 1974 UK hung
    parliament that I wish I could see in theater.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X">The Social Life of Small Urban
    Spaces</a>
    by William H. Whyte.</strong> I bought this book because I wanted to
    understand why some places in my neighborhood work so much better
    than others. The book is easy to read, short, but packed with useful
    information and I can't recommend it enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Django-Testing-Debugging-Tracey-Karen/dp/1847197566">Django 1.1 Testing and
    Debugging</a>
    by Karen M. Tracey. Book has some flaws: 50\$ price on Amazon,
    sometimes too much details, obsolete Django 1.1. Nevertheless I
    would recommend it since it does provide a very good and mostly
    still relevant introduction to this topic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Brother-His-Hakan-Lindquist/dp/3867870853">My Brother and His
    Brother</a>
    by Hakan Lindquist. A warm and sad love story about a boy
    discovering life and personality of brother he never knew.
    Recommended.</li>
<li><a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
    1.5</a> by Daniel Greenfeld, Audrey Roy. I
    read this book in alpha and beta form, but can nevertheless heartily
    recommend it to every Django developer. It gives you something to
    think about even when you disagree, but you'll learn plenty too.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Embers-S%C3%A1ndor-M%C3%A1rai/dp/0375707425">Embers</a>
    by Sándor Márai.</strong> An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for
    those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than
    surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation
    (from Hungarian via German).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351">Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black
    Art</a>
    by Steve McConnell. A must-read book on software estimation for
    every developer. I just wish it had more to say about challenges of
    estimation in agile environments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Uncommon-Reader-A-Novella/dp/0312427646">The Uncommon
    Reader</a>
    by Alan Bennett. A witty book about pleasures and downsides of
    reading. Good fun for bookworms.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Cups-Deceit-Humanitarian-ebook/dp/B004XHVOW4">Three Cups of
    Deceit</a>
    by Jon Krakauer. Investigative journalism at its best. Look at
    (mal)practice of Central Asia Institute and its founder. Unlikely to
    be interesting to those who've never heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024514.do">The Accessibility
    Handbook</a> by Katie
    Cunningham. This fairly short book has a few minor errors, but it is
    packed with information and should be required reading for every web
    developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do">Bandit Algorithms for Website
    Optimization</a> by
    John Myles White. If you do A/B testing, but don't know what bandit
    algorithms are, then this short, practical and well-written book
    will noticeably improve your work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Town-Two-Years-Yangtze/dp/0060953748/">River Town: Two Years on
    Yangtze</a>
    by Peter Hessler.</strong> A wonderfully alive and sensitive depiction of
    life in small China town that might change how you see China.
    Couldn't put it down.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Misunderstanding-Irene-Nemirovsky/dp/0099563843/">The
    Misunderstanding</a>
    by Irene Nemirovsky. I completely disagree with the review on
    Amazon. This would be a very good book even if its author wasn't 21
    when she wrote it. Certainly not sentimental, but also not a overly
    judgemental look at life of a doomed affair.</li>
<li>PADI Open Water Diver Manual by . Lots of good information, but
    poorly organized with bunch of infomercial crap at the back. Still
    much better than cretinous videos and definitely helps to pass the
    exam.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radiance-King-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590174550">The Radiance of the
    King</a>
    by Camara Laye. If you have a literal sort of mind, then don't skip
    Toni Morisson's introduction. Beautifully written, still relevant
    and not completely understood by me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Criticism-Prickly-Paradigm/dp/0972819630">What Happened to Art
    Criticism</a>
    by James Elkins. Book that reads like listening to dinner polemic.
    Still insightful look into why modern art criticism satisfies few,
    but a bit evasive at times. Did not resolve my problems with modern
    art.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Porting-Python-3--depth-guide/dp/1456411519/">Porting to Python 3: An in-depth
    guide</a>
    by Lennart Regebro. An encouragingly short book on the topic that
    still feels complete. Made me want to make my code Python3
    compatible.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0156027321">Life of
    Pi</a> by Yann
    Martel. Read it after I accidentally saw the movie which I
    surprisingly (to me at least) liked a lot. The book and the movie
    are really two takes on the same story, both standing on their own,
    but I liked the movie a bit better. The book is much darker and not
    for the squeamish.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimerica-Lucy-Kirkwood/dp/1848423209/">Chimerica</a>
    by Lucy Kirkwood.</strong> I bought this book after I've seen this
    remarkable play and it is equally impactful when "just" read. Can't
    recommend strongly enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Oberon-Modern-Niklas-Radstrom/dp/1840029285/">Monsters</a>
    by Niklas Radstrom. Short drama about unfathomable tragedy when
    children kill a child and the complicity of non-involvement we are
    guilty of.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926078/">Decline and
    Fall</a>
    by Evelyn Waugh.</strong> 85 years old satire of British society that is
    sadly relevant and very funny.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/">Testable
    Javascript</a>
    by Mark Ethan Trostler. A book with (I think) slightly incorrect
    title. I wish ratio between explaining how to test Javascript and
    how to set up environment was more in favor of the former, but still
    good book to read on the subject.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Stone-City-Ismail-Kadare/dp/0802120687">The Fall of the Stone
    City</a>
    by Ismail Kadare.</strong> Complex and rich tale of power, dictatorship and
    integrity. Just read it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Charlie-Hill/dp/1781251630">Books</a> by
    Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would
    be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am
    certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author's
    view (which I do).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raising-Steam-Discworld-novel-Novels/dp/0857522272/">Raising
    Steam</a>
    by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best
    work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans
    with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).</li>
</ol>
<p>This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really
like to build a couple of things I've been postponing for years now.
Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and
is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.</p>
