1813</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guardian published a well written
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1646125,00.html">article</a>
about intellectual property and ownership of ideas. I've been thinking a
lot about this lately, as I'm certain other entrepreneurs often do.
Especially those with companies where assets are mainly good people you
work with and intangible stuff like software. And ideas, which many
think should be owned and protected.</p>
<p>I've never been one of them, but I understand that patents are a complex
enough subject which is difficult to explore and where policy has been
based mainly on personal beliefs of people involved in creating it.</p>
<p>As Jefferson has already said, exclusive right to invention is not a
natural right, but a right given for the benefit of society. So, are
patents still benefiting society at large? Would we stop innovating
without patents, as some suggest?</p>
<p>I don't want to repeat ideas and arguments stated so many times by
people more eloquent than me. However, I'd like to make a simple
reasoning on what patents mean and what we could expect if there weren't
any.</p>
<p>I believe there's an agreement from all sides that a patent was supposed
to protect an invention from competitors for a limited amount of time.
It should prevent others from profiting on it and therefore makes it
easier to do so for inventor. This means a patent's exclusivity reduces
pressure from competition and therefore somewhat reduces competitiveness
of environment for the inventor.</p>
<p>Thus abolishing all patents would lead to an extremely competitive
environment. How would companies and any would-be entrepreneurs react to
a world like this?</p>
<p>In a world, where there's no shortage of people willing and able to
manufacture products at costs far below of those achievable in Europe or
USA, it's inevitable to keep producing new ideas if you want to
differentiate yourself. Not inventing is simply not an option as long as
you're willing to compete.</p>
<p>There always were and always will be those willing to compete, if window
of opportunity between invention and its replication by competitors is
large enough to recoup investment and making a profit. A canonical
example of industry like this is a software industry, where it's fairly
cheap to develop new stuff. No need for patents there.</p>
<p>However, in industries where that window is too small, there simply
won't be an industry if it's either not made bigger or the investment
made cheaper. Canonical example for this is pharmaceutical industry,
where window is enlarged with patents and investments are cheapened by
governmental grants.</p>
<p>Hence question evolves to what kind of future is coming. Will most new
stuff require long and expensive development cycle or will it keep
getting shorter and cheaper?</p>
<p>My bet is on cheaper and shorter. Not only because we can see this
already happening, but also because there's every reason to believe this
trend will continue for foreseeable future. Hardware is getting more
generic and differentiation is moving to embedded software exactly
because it's faster and cheaper to develop. This is true for every
product that has at least one button on it (mobiles, cars etc.) and even
for a lot of those, that don't (popular example being a modern hotel
doorknob).</p>
<p>If this is how future will look like, then legislation should reflect
that and patents should be limited only to design patents and to
industries that genuinely need them or abolished completely and in
certain cases replaced with already existing grants.</p>
<p>There's a plethora of reasons I haven't even touched, why modern
intellectual property laws (and patent laws in particular) are hurting
our society already. But I think what makes it even worse is that we are
stubbornly marching in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Benefit of society, not personal or corporate gain is what this was
supposed to be all about.</p>
