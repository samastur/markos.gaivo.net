        <div class="post-text">
            <p>Q: How can you tell that you're at tech conference?</p>
<p>A: The line in front of men's toilets is longer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media 2006</a> has finished. It was
great and I specially enjoyed presentations given by <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">Nate
Koechley</a> and <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy
Clarke</a>. Those two alone made going
worthwhile and if you have a chance to see any of them, don't miss the
opportunity.</p>
<p>The conference was much bigger this year, which is one thing I didn't
like. It was harder to find people you were looking for and even if you
did find them, they were usually already occupied by somebody else. If
you're an introverted guy like me and not a natural orator, then it can
be a bit difficult to make the most of the time you have. I didn't, but
I'm glad I finally met <a href="http://www.clagnut.com/">Richard</a>, who's an even
nicer guy in real life.<br />
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span>A quick summary of sessions I attended:<span
style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer</a> talked about last 10
    years of CSS. An interesting talk, but for me even more important,
    he explained to me why <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=122">margin
    collapsing</a> wasn't a daft idea.</li>
<li>I went to a design panel with <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon
    Hicks</a>, <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php">Veerle
    Pieters</a> and <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron
    Moll</a>, since I know a thing or two
    about Javascript, but I'm completely design illiterate, which this
    blog can only attest to. I can't say how designers liked it, but it
    was certainly very educational for me. I knew I choose my colors as
    if I was colorblind, but I also discovered I need to learn more
    about grids.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a> gave a nice rundown of the
    state of web typography and pros and cons of different methods and
    Andy Budd entertainingly as always presented tricks and approaches
    to tackling browser bugs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html">Jeffrey Veen</a> talked about Web
    2.0 and new applications and although he made quite a lot of good
    points, I'm not sure openness wins every time. My counter example
    would be instant messaging, where GTalk hasn't changed the field
    much. I hope I'm wrong and this will change in the future.</li>
<li>Day two started with <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm's</a>
    interesting presentation, where I again learned a trick or two. I
    especially enjoyed the way to build scalable arrows using CSS.</li>
<li>Dan's talk was followed with Javascript panel. Personally, I think
    the idea of centralized hosting of Javascript libraries to improve
    caching doesn't make much sense. If nothing else you bet that your
    visitors will also be able to access your caching sites which might
    not always be true. It certainly isn't in this part of the world,
    where partial break-downs are not all that uncommon. Still, the
    panel probably deserves its own post.</li>
<li>Cameron Moll also gave a presentation on the state of mobile web
    design. It wasn't bad, but I hoped for more.</li>
<li>Nate Koechley's talk was a revelation. An incredible amount of good
    information and it's been eye opening for me to learn about Yahoo's
    experience. Scary that they build an internet explorer emulating
    layer for Yahoo Mail though (why didn't they just drop the original
    code and start over?).</li>
<li>I enjoyed last year's session with Andy Clarke, so I decided to
    attend this years as well and I wasn't disappointed. I've been a fan
    of Andy's work for quite some time now and I'm definitely buying his
    book when it comes out. So should you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this is it. I hope to be there again next year.</p>
