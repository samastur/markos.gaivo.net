            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Quite a lot has happened during time when I was away from this blog and
I'll probably talk about some of it in next few days, but I'd like to
start with news from Google.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=14">badly written post</a> when
Google Talk was unveiled. What bothered me most was the fact that it
didn't communicate with anybody and was in fact another walled garden.</p>
<p>Well, they <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html" title="Open federation announcement">fixed
it</a>
and Google Talk now actually talks to other jabber servers including
ours.</p>
<p>There are some problems with presence notification, but it's hard to say
yet who's fault it is and I wouldn't be surprised if it was ours. Sad
thing about jabber is that there are few if any open source server
implementations that wouldn't be just a notch above suck.</p>
<p>In short run this won't change much. Most people will still be on
competing services and it might be difficult to get them off. But as a
newborn optimist I see a promise of an open, working IM, where you're
not tied to wishes and development of one company even when that company
is mine. And that can only be good.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/xmlhttprequest-and-status-0.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to XMLHttpRequest and status 0">XMLHttpRequest and status 0</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Have you ever encountered a problem with XMLHttpRequest (XHR), where its
handler couldn't read request status or the status was set to 0?</p>
<p>Well, I did, a few days ago.</p>
<p>It took me a while to find the cause of this problem and in my case it
was form submission. It's stupid to use AJAX to submit a form, but
nevertheless it's what I'm doing for dubious reasons that I'll probably
be ashamed of in a few months or years. And it used to work fine, until
I changed submit buttons from <em>type="button"</em> to <em>type="image"</em>.</p>
<p>First type needs javascript to do anything worthwhile, while second type
submits form when pressed, which I somehow missed. So, when I thought I
was sending only a normal XHR request, I was actually also submitting my
form which lead to described strange behavior.</p>
<p>I have no idea why, since XHR state change handler shouldn't be
triggered by other requests, but it was and it was fixed by simply
canceling form submission in image button <em>onclick</em> handler.</p>
<p>If you ever encounter this problem, check your forms and their submit
buttons. It's very likely that solution is hiding there.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/lastyear/">@media 2005</a> was
fantastic and it look like <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media
2006</a> will be at least as good. If
you're a web developer and <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/speakers/">the list of
speakers</a> doesn't get you
excited, then you ought to find another vocation.</p>
<p>On a different note this blog is on hiatus until mid-January.</p>
