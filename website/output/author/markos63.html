            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web
designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS
Reboot</a> day. I find the idea at least odd, if
not exactly wrong, so this blog won't be one of them.</p>
<p>As can be clearly seen, I'm not a graphic designer. Even though I'm
certain my current design is better than previous was, it's not exactly
good either. There's also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife
picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability.
Then again, it's not my intention to discuss a particular design as much
as graphic design use and its role in general.</p>
<p>What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design
is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily
discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year.
It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging
software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page
of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence.
This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly
exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same
mold?</p>
<p>I'm sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or
where it's the story itself. But more often than not it's something that
not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it
is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only
when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does
so.</p>
<p>I don't write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting
value. I wish I was like <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a>
and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published,
but I'm not. What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one
coherent whole and it's vexing that design by its singularity implies
that.</p>
<p>In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they
should know better only implies values I don't share, but certainly
doesn't enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern
widely used content management systems which as all software embodies
values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often
rather ignorant users .</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/robot-exclusion-profile.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Robot Exclusion Profile">Robot Exclusion Profile</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>As could be expected, I wasn't the first one who thought about
controlling spiders more granularly. Even though I prefer deny-allow
idea that <a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> and I came up
with after a lively debate yesterday, I think <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/robots-exclusion" title="Link to format specification">Robot Exclusion
Profile</a>
(REP) microformat is not a bad start. Actually, it's quite good with a
few open <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/robots-exclusion#Issues">issues</a>
that mostly shouldn't be too difficult to resolve.</p>
<h4>Precedence</h4>
<p>I don't think it matters what policy you have when dealing with
conflicting classes set on the same element, as long as you choose one.
Personally, I'd mimic CSS way and go for last definition stays. So
<em>class="robots-nofollow robots-follow"</em> would be equal to
<em>class="robots-follow"</em>. I'd say the same order precedence also should
stand in <em>class="robots-follow" rel="nofollow"</em> case.</p>
<p>Toolkits might have a problem with this approach, since you often can't
tell in which order were attributes set. If this is deemed important,
then I think a reasonable approach in case of conflict is to simply
ignore <strong>all</strong> exclusion attributes.</p>
<p>However, I think there's another ambiguity that hasn't been mentioned.
What should a spider do, if it encounters something like this:<br />
<codeins ="robots-exclusion"></codeins></p>
<p>It's a valid scenario. Imagine your average blog sidebar, which includes
navigational items like archives that probably don't belong in index,
but can also include stuff like current post categories, which should.</p>
<p>I think specification heavily implies CSS approach to this (the most
specific value wins) and that spider should process all elements, even
those included inside of parts that might later get ignored. Still, it
would be nice if this was explicitly written.</p>
<h4>Specificity</h4>
<p>I simply don't care. Even without control of specific UA it's clearly a
superset of today's behavior. It doesn't remove anything. It only adds
control and in a way, where default behavior is today's behavior. So it
could hardly be less intrusive.</p>
<p>I also think proposed solution for the problem is good enough, but we
could add this later on, if needed.</p>
<h4>Suitability as a microformat</h4>
<p>Well, this is the though one. I don't think there's much if any
difference between
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/relnofollow">relnofollow</a> and this
specification (REP being really only a moderate extension of
relnofollow). In both cases human's don't really come first before
computers or at least not directly. In both cases you want to influence
search engines to produce better search results, which consequently
helps humans.</p>
<p>I see myself as a technological pragmatist so I care more about the end
result then sticking to some high ideal. If it's accepted that
controlling spider behavior would be beneficial and I see no opposition
to this idea, then it seems obvious that a reasonable end product
(specification) will look a lot like a defined microformat.</p>
<p>So is the problem really only in daring to call it a microformat and
sticking it on a microformats website?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re preparing a workshop at Spletne urice (???Web hours??? in
Slovenian, a weekly meeting of web enthusiasts) that will focus on
AJAX, hosted by me and another Marko. Actually we’re preparing two of
them. The first one will cover the basics of asynchronous transport
and data, the second one will add some DOM scripting and review some
AJAX frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being the other Marko I can say this workshop will totally rock. It has
to, because AJAX is cool, right? Instant fame, riches and all that.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I do believe it will be a great experience for those
who'll attend. Everyone is welcome, but only first 10, sorry, 9
<a href="http://web.zen.si/archives/2006/04/ajax-workshop/">registered</a> will get
this chance because of limits imposed on us by the choice of venue. It's
even free (not likely to happen again any time soon), so price can be
hardly something to worry about.</p>
<p>You can also help us make it better for you by contributing websites
you'd like to see getting a makeover and telling us as much as you can
about what you'd like to hear there (and what not).</p>
<p><strong>Update: Workshop is full and registration is closed. I'm sorry not
everyone will get a chance to participate, but we might do another one
later this year.</strong></p>
