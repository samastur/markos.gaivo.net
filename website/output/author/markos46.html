            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I appreciate efforts by
<a href="http://www.vecer.si/blog/zvone" title="Zvone's blog">Zvone</a> in trying to
build the best slovenian blogging platform. I really do. Although it
might be better than others, the technical implementation is still very
poor.</p>
<p>A new season of web talks (Spletne Urice) will start in month and a half
and one of the ideas contemplated was to publish regular column, where
common development mistakes would get dissected and possible solutions
would also be shown. I'm more or less convinced that there's a real need
for it.</p>
<p>This is not about technical puritanism of following standards for their
own sake. I've discovered this last transgression trying to find out why
I couldn't post a comment while others obviously could. What I found was
Javascript code that looked like this:</p>
<p><codeins ="vecerjscrap"></codeins></p>
<p>Now, this has nothing to do with my problem. But it's still an atrocious
code that should be put out of its misery as soon as possible.
Javascript does have loops, which come in forms familiar to users of
most modern programming languages.</p>
<p>It's also a remarkably poor spam filter which can work only as long as
spammers don't put any effort into averting it.</p>
<p>If this is the state of slovenian web development, and it is, even when
lots of good work done so far has been considered, it's clear why more
work should be done in educating developers of how and why they should
change their practices. I'm sure most of them don't produce crap like
this purposefully.</p>

                <p>I need help. I'm looking to expand my horizons, learn something new and
generally make positive and decisive steps to being less ignorant. I'd
be most grateful, if you could help me, dear reader, by pointing out
interesting and useful resources out there.</p>
<p>The topics are not really important. I may be biased to deepening my
knowledge of history and design, but every topic and more importantly,
every resource is a good one as long as you personally find it
interesting and it's accessible to neophytes.</p>
<p>There is an exception to this. Resources about software and software
development should be avoided unless they cover the field from a
completely original point of view or were created by an author, who is
raving mad. I'd prefer both, but later requirement probably already
includes former.</p>
<p>I don't care about the form either as long as it's fairly accessible.
Books, blogs, podcasts, movies etc. are all fair game, but conferences
with couple of thousand dollars entrance fees (or organized in USA)
aren't.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="/javascript-17.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Javascript 1.7">Javascript 1.7</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I fairly often talk to developers with disdain for Javascript. I don't
blame them, since I used to share it. There are various reasons for it,
some more valid than others, but one that almost never comes up is the
very thing that bothers me most.</p>
<p>I was reading about
<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7" title="Introduction to Javascript 1.7">features</a>
promised for Javascript 1.7 which should be a part of Firefox 2.0 and I
like lots of them. How wouldn't I when only few of them can't be found
in Python.</p>
<p>The thing is, most of the time I have almost absolute control of which
version of Python, Java or what have you I'll use. But when your code
lives inside of a browser, you're pretty much stuck with what's out
there and if my experience is anything to go by then I won't be using
new features widely before next decade.</p>
<p>Who wants to wait that long?</p>
