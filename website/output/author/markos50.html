    Ever since I listened to Andy Clarke’s talk at @media, I’ve been convinced that what we’re missing is a simple way to distinguish between visitors which need accessible version of the site and those who would prefer to use a non-accessible version.
   </p>
   <p>
    I still think that by and large sites should be made accessible to everyone and done so completely. But just as Braille signs are used only by those who need them, there’s no reason why everyone should be using the same user interface when not doing so can be beneficial.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who’ve been dabbling with Javascript and AJAX for a while have probably noticed that it can be very difficult if often not impossible to make every piece of interface accessible. A common approach was to add javascript as a layer on top of an accessible website, which could be turned off when necessary. I find this a rather blunt instrument, since all or nothing approach removes even pieces that may be useful and accessible. Yet, there didn’t seem to be a better way.
   </p>
   <p>
    Accessibility preference would ideally be provided by a browser in a way that can be picked up with Javascript (environment variable?), but lacking that, I was looking for a way to signal such preference through user defined CSS. My idea was to define a syntactically valid, but normally not used combination of a page element, CSS property and its value that could be interpreted as a switch for accessible version of the site.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, now
    <a href="http://osflash.org/flashaid">
     there’s
    </a>
    another way to learn if screen reader is used (
    <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/77#comment-container">
     via
    </a>
    Jeremy Keith), which uses Flash 8 and its JS-Flash bridge to read if such a device is present. Obviously its use is not universal, but it covers scenario that troubles me most.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still a real fix would be a better support from user agents. It doesn’t seem to be that hard to add an environment variable and a preference switch, so is there some other reason why it hasn’t happened yet?

    You know you have a busy week when you don’t get around to posting a couple of sentences short note.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s been great seeing that Microsoft
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/06/27/648269.aspx">
     proved
    </a>
    what I’ve been saying all along. Customization can be a problem especially when it benefits few on account of many.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the other hand, does anyone wonder HOW do they know all that?

    A
    <a href="http://log.rucigaj.com/">
     friend
    </a>
    of mine is having a lousy year. He broke a leg, but further complications have brought him back to the hospital. I wanted to lend him some DVD’s to shorten those long hours in bed, yet who has the time to transcribe all those titles?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, if you’re a Mac user, then there’s a program called
    <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">
     Delicious Library
    </a>
    which lets you (among other things) input those DVD’s by simply scanning the barcode with a camera. I have to say that calling that program awesome is an understatement. I simply can’t think of a better designed piece of software. It is as if every piece of the program, every line of code or UI ornament was specifically minted for your satisfaction. True craftsmanship.
   </p>
   <p>
    I once heard that persian rugs were always created with one deliberate mistake, since only god was allowed true perfection. Well, there’s a mistake like that in Delicious Library. I tried to buy it for more than an hour, probably more like two, and it simply wouldn’t budge. You can’t buy it through a browser. You have to use its own interface which in my case simply refused to work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally I gave up and wrote a message about my tribulations that in hindsight could be more friendly. I’ve soon received a friendly message from Mike together with an evaluation license, which allowed me to produce the list.

   <p>
    I often complain about the way companies treat their customers and it’s really a pleasure to write about an experience like this. Not only do they produce a remarkable product, they also go all the way when it comes to helping their customers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now I only have to find a way to actually pay for it, since the product and people behind it more than deserve it.
