    I don’t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to

    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn’t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.
   </p>
   <p>
    We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don’t, you really ought to find something. I’ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you’ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.
   </p>
   <p>
    I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can – in time and geography. I haven’t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.

   <p>
    Three months ago I received an invitation to try and review
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://toshl.com" rel="homepage" title="Toshl">
     Toshl
    </a>
    , a mobile expense tracker developed by
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.3fs.si" rel="homepage" title="ThirdFrameStudios">
     ThirdFrameStudios
    </a>
    . I also received code to get? Pro account free for first year to help me test it, which saved me a modest amount of 20 euros. It is also not a secret that I know people working at 3fs and admire their work.
   </p>
   <p>
    As influences go, that’s it. I received neither threats to pets I don’t have or contributions to a bank account I do have. Also a complete absence of nudges means that this post took longer than planned and that all opinions are mine. Too make them less ignorant I decided at start to give Toshl a proper test and use it for couple of months before passing judgment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Toshl, as mentioned, is a tool for keeping track of expenses. You are obviously sensible enough to know why this is wise, if you are still reading this, so I won’t bother explaining. It comes as a free application for
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android">
     Android
    </a>
    devices and
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.maemo.org/" rel="homepage" title="Maemo">
     Maemo
    </a>
    based N900. I heard rumors of an
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage" title="iPhone 3G">
     iPhone
    </a>
    version, but Symbian or
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.blackberry.com/" rel="homepage" title="BlackBerry">
     BlackBerry
    </a>
    owners are out of luck (for now). Using web based companion and synchronization is free too, but you have to pay for Pro account if you want to add expenses through website or need a more flexible export of your data.
   </p>
   <p>
    I tested Nokia N900 version of Toshl and liked it. I don’t want to go into details since they quickly become boring and there is no better test than your own (remember, it’s free). I was impressed how well it handles
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator" rel="wikipedia" title="Decimal separator">
     decimal separator
    </a>
    for me, since I sin by using both comma and point.
   </p>
   <p>
    Entering expenses is easy and quick, especially if you have entered similar recently, since you can reuse tags just by clicking on suggested. You also see already entered expenses sorted by time or tags. There is still room for improvement (like adapting tags suggestions based on first entered), but not much to fault.
   </p>
   <p>
    I believe Toshl’s goal is to be as simple and fun tracker of everyday expenses as possible. You can do basic add and removal of expenses, export inserted data, categorize each entry with tags and see few different reports. That’s it. There is no integration with banks, currency conversions,? or even a notion of income. Reports are basic and I am not a fan of those included.
   </p>
   <p>
    I usually used more than one tag on each expense and had difficulty wrapping my head around graphs where same expense could be shown multiple times. I failed at judging how much impact do some expenses have overall without at least some tweaking of graphs. I am certain that Tufte would call it chartjunk, but their implementation certainly is fun to play with.
   </p>
   <p>
    And that’s where Toshl’s main strength is. A fun way of doing something that most people find incredibly tedious. You might overgrow it one day and switch, but it will help you develop a necessary habit of recording your expenses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Being simple and fun doesn’t mean powerless. Tags free you to your own categorization and multiple export options give you an opportunity to massage that data further in tools of your choice. It might not be as trivial as clicking on a graph is, but doing it in Excel is not much harder.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will not continue to use it because I am that sort of person who gets off on
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" rel="wikipedia" title="Double-entry bookkeeping system">
     double-entry bookkeeping
    </a>
    . I’ve been using
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.gnucash.org/" rel="homepage" title="GnuCash">
     GnuCash
    </a>
    for years and there is no easy way to sync data with it (probably shouldn’t be either) and few reasons to input every expense twice. I do recommend anyone who isn’t tracking yet or is not satisfied with his current approach to give Toshl a try.
   </p>
   <p>
    And if you are happy with free version, then buy a Pro account. It costs little, gives you features as polished as rest of service and it help secure your apps future.

     Joshua Porter’s
    </a>
    workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that’s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" rel="homepage" title="Facebook Connect">
     Facebook Connect
    </a>
    as Facebook “owning” their users.
   </p>
   <p>
    They are right, but it doesn’t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.
   </p>
   <p>
    My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?
   </p>
   <p>
    There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Awareness -&gt; Sign-up -&gt; First-time use -&gt; Engagement -&gt; Referral
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using Facebook Connect (or
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://oauth.net" rel="homepage" title="OAuth">
     OAuth
    </a>
    ,
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://openid.net" rel="homepage" title="OpenID Foundation">
     OpenID
    </a>
    …) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It’s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to “full” members to make such commitment more enticing.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?
   </p>
   <p>
    Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.
   </p>
   <p>
    All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I’ll let you know how it went.
