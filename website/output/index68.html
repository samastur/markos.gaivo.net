    Years ago I published my first code and I still remember the anxiety. Will people notice that I’m an incompetent idiot or do they already know?
   </p>
   <p>
    I grew up a lot since then and these days I know I’m not a great programmer. Even more importantly, I’m comfortable with this. But as I was reading
    <a href="http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/">
     vobject’s
    </a>
    code to see how difficult it would be to add support for vCard 2.1 and hCard, it dawned on me… Jeffrey is a much better programmer than me and there’s little hope that my yet-nonexistent contribution won’t spoil his code.

    Have you ever created a new design for an existing website without changing XHTML templates?
   </p>
   <p>
    I’m not talking about designs for
    <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">
     css Zen Garden
    </a>
    and its imitators or any other occasion where doing so was done to prove a point. What I mean is building a new design on existing XHTML template during normal course of action.
   </p>
   <p>
    I haven’t and I don’t know anyone who did. It’s also hard to imagine being otherwise if designs are done without taking existing XHTML into account. There’s always an element missing for attaching a part of your design to, unless XHTML was somewhat loose to begin with.
   </p>
   <p>
    I don’t think this is a problem. There are plenty of real benefits to table-less designs and few, if any deficiencies. However, I do believe that this benefit, touted by many including me, is contrived.
   </p>
   <p>
    Or am I just wrong? What’s your experience?

    gave
    <a href="http://web.zen.si/archives/2005/10/spletne-urice-2-mikroformati/">
     a talk
    </a>
    about microformats last October and some people back then were doubtful about their usefulness. Yesterday I read
    <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/Blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">
     a post
    </a>
    by Ray Ozzie on the need for web clipboards and accompanying formats and my immediate thought was that microformats were perfect for this use.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ray Ozzie talks about a need for easy interoperability and exchange of data between web sites and I believe most if not all of us who are working towards this goal agree that feeds (RSS or whatever) by themselves are not enough. Web clipboards seem to be a big step in right direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    The post itself has since been updated with more information and a
    <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">
     great demo
    </a>
    how microformats could be used as a clipboard format for greater interoperability between different web services. You should check it out even if you don’t have doubts about the need for microformats.
   </p>
   <p>
    I find it odd that these days I get more excited by stuff that’s coming out of Microsoft then out of Google.
