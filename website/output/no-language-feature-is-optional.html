        <div class="post-text">
            <p>Until recently I've been using Python 2.3.x almost exclusively and I
thought it was about time I get more familiar with what 2.4 series has
to offer. I've skimmed the list of new features when point zero version
came out and found some things that I like (e.g sets) and some that I
disliked (e.g. decorators).</p>
<p>So, this time I invested a bit more time to actually read and understand
what was on offer and how these features came about. I still haven't
found a need or a sympathy for decorators, although I can see why some
people want them. Personally, I believe they'll more likely be a cause
for less readable and harder to understand Python code than they prove
to be useful.</p>
<p>I still think Python is a wonderful language, but gone are the days when
I was looking forward to each release and goodness it brought. These
days I'm afraid to look and discover another feature that helps more
with keeping habits from other languages than adding something new and
genuinely useful.</p>
<p>I like minimalism in all things and therefore see every new feature as a
burden that should be more than offset by its usefulness. I'm not a
language designer and hence can't really say or tell if Python is going
down the wrong track, but there is something that I find most annoying.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about languages quite a lot recently; how we use and
abuse them and what impact our language proficiency has on our
communications. There's one thing I find very different with programming
languages than those used for normal human interaction.</p>
<p>There's very little optional about them.</p>
<p>It really gets my goat when a language feature is defended as being
optional. You may have a choice in using a feature, but you certainly
don't get a choice in learning and understanding its use. Even if you
don't use it yourself, you'll quite likely have to interact with
somebody else's code, which does and unlike with English, it's not
enough to just get a sense of meaning from its context. You actually
have to really understand what it does and hence need to be familiar
with feature itself.</p>
<p>It might still be worthwhile to add it, but let's not pretend when we do
that it's completely optional.</p>
<p>P.S: Isn't it amazing that after all these years, we still have a global
interpreter lock? Wouldn't it be better if we worked on removing that
disgrace?</p>
