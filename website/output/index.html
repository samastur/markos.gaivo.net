            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Another year's over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to
2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many
ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are
better covered in a grimly entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0">Charlie Brooker's 2014
Wipe</a>. A must watch is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis">Adam Curtis'</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0#t=28m23s">segment</a> on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov">Vladislav Surkov</a> (jump
to 28:23 if it doesn't automatically). It may be the most horrifying
thing I learned last year.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1199">became 40</a> in 2014. One thing I
did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is
how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older
too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now.
They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they
all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.</p>
<p>My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a
lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find
much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related
things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I
often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and
necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.</p>
<p>Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped
fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to
identify with^<span
id="review-2014-1"><a href="#review-2014-1-note">[1]</a></span>^. Doing so would
(did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and
solve.</p>
<p>Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my
happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly
happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my
relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really
gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am <strong>not</strong>
emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute
observer rarely notices more than relationship’s phase shifts and has a
limited ability to influence the outcomes^<span
id="review-2014-2"><a href="#review-2014-2-note">[2]</a></span>^. Limited does not
mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels
elusive and counter-productive.</p>
<p>Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make
working at abattoir palatable.</p>
<p>I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read
and...), but I am becoming suspicious of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">quantified
self</a> movement. Its focus
on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological
parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always
a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving
measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into
trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified
dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an
automaton.</p>
<p>If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort
of is.
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=664" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading">Again</a>.
However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that
not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.</p>
<p>In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This
year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may
scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on
Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to
find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.</p>
<p>I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have"finished"
<a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">mjp</a> against my plans. What made it
worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could
use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery's API is
interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end
developer.</p>
<p>My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working
computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find
a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so
it will be useful later.</p>
<p>Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored,
but I'm keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of
well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often
than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a
practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an
ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists
of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with
mixed results.</p>
<p>I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly
little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I
read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and
do it without proper thematic focus.</p>
<p>I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that
inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from
reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed
reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple
accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.</p>
<p>My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a
questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be
doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen
books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I
will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.</p>
<p>I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a
representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still
directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not
publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly
sabbath will provide some time and focus.</p>
<p>It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not
happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for
its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to
me. If I can't use the language on a concrete project, than it is not
likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating
between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also
definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go
on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn
something new.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even
heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new
positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while,
but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by
spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start
implementing "reader" as I have learned what I needed to begin and there
are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out
how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I
could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when
little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On
a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last
year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It <em>is</em> something to
keep an eye on this year.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10
books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of
what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post
which should be up early next year.</p>
<p>I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading
even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year
(started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don't expect to finish in few
hours that are left of this year).</p>
<p>All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American
which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on
tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not
recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the
point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously
reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy
e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for
those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is
reserved for those I found best: <em>The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and
The Quiet American</em>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024">The Quiet
    American</a>

    Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for
    those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and
    this one doesn't disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even
    prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to
    experience all the things it warned it about.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not
achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid
fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific
goal which is to finally finish

even if I discover that I don't like it.</p>

                <p>Disappointed I stopped using Twitter at the end of 2011 and have since
visited it mostly to follow up specific references. As a medium I found
it lacking but ignorable until recently. While I was reading about the
aptly named <a href="http://imgur.com/a/nUX1A">Jacobinghazi affair</a> I felt the
urge to tweet and pronounce Twitter as possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/samastur/status/476707986006880256">more toxic than
Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>This article has been provoked by
<a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/">Tomaž's</a> polite disagreement and is
my late attempt to explain what I couldn’t on Twitter.</p>
<h2>My objections</h2>
<p>Leon Wieseltier recently described Twitter as <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118125/leon-wieseltier-responds-alain-de-bottons-attack-twitter">a place of infinite
discharge of emotion and
promotion</a>
where nothing intellectually or linguistically substantial can be
accomplished. It is a great and true enough description of Twitter.</p>
<p>Over the years a number of articles have discussed effects of new media
on society in its largest sense. While I am interested in those my
comment was mainly about Twitter’s role in shaping how individuals and
communities think, communicate and behave.</p>
<p>In blogging heyday I thoroughly disliked celebration of rapid exchange
of half-baked ideas. Making them smaller and exchange more rapid is not
an improvement. Ideas have always been cheap and plentiful when untested
and inspiring to the unwitting. Twitter is vast and there may be much
worth reading, but chances are most of what you will read will be soon
forgotten fluff. Creating on a medium like Twitter is hard since most
things worth saying can’t be clearly expressed in 140 characters, nuance
is valued even less than continuity and every good tweet can be buried
in a pile of inane responses.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I originally stopped using Twitter was
realisation that I found tweets from a fair number of otherwise
congenial and intelligent people regularly off-putting. Twitter did not
suddenly found their previously hidden depravity, instead its forced
brevity of semi-public discourse made a great deal of it sound like
movie informants wearing a wire. It is a great demonstration of how
dialogue changes when we think others are listening and an insidious
tool for normalising blanket snooping, much of it our own.</p>
<p>Research has shown that our brains keep adapting to their use and
improving one skill often leads to deterioration of another or as
McLuhan put it: “Every extension is also an amputation.” I lost count of
people describing their difficulty with reading longer, more slowly
developing articles after an expectation of instant gratification has
been built by a steady diet of short ones. It doesn’t get more instant
than a tweet and Twitter’s interface is optimised for non-discriminative
reading of a never ending stream of tweets.^<span
id="twitter-toxic-1"><a href="#twitter-toxic-1-note">[1]</a></span>^ Can this
really be good for a thinking person?</p>
<p>My tweet which led to this piece was provoked by an absolutely absurd
argument closely matching Alan Jacob’s description of <a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2013/12/twitter-at-its-worst.html">Twitter at its
worst</a>.
Maybe worst, but certainly not rare. Of course arguments with all the
negative baggage are not exclusive to Twitter, but Twitter does seem a
more emotive medium than most of them. Discussions on Twitter are
commonly a sad sight because it isn’t built for dialog. It is a
marketing machine and works best when used as such.^<span
id="twitter-toxic-2"><a href="#twitter-toxic-2-note">[2]</a></span>^ Unsurprisingly
millions of its users conform to its design hints by sharing content or
less obviously with signalling group membership by snarking and
sloganeering at sometimes only imagined opposition.</p>
<p>Ian Danskin’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTUW-owa2w">“This is Phil
Fish”</a> video essay^<span
id="twitter-toxic-3"><a href="#twitter-toxic-3-note">[3]</a></span>^ about the
nature of online fame recently made rounds and I can’t recommend it
enough. Fame can appear without being sought and the longer it lasts,
the more likely it is that the famous will become a stand-in for a
concept to which public often responds negatively. This is especially
unpleasant and difficult to deal with when the negative concept is tied
not to what you did, but who you are or are perceived to be.</p>
<p>On Twitter (as previously noted) tweets may be written with a recipient
in mind, but can be seen by anyone so all of them contribute to our
public image without it being in our control.^<span
id="twitter-toxic-4"><a href="#twitter-toxic-4-note">[4]</a></span>^ Controlling
tweets comprehension and propagation by relying on cultural norms to
differentiate audiences does not work because those norms may not be
well known and are certainly not accepted by everyone.</p>
<p>We speak when we want to pass on an idea. Amplifying ideas of others can
be worthy, but we are more enriched when new ideas are created and
explored. The really interesting ones can be controversial, rough and in
need of a nurturing environment in which to develop. Twitter is not that
place.</p>
<p>Mobbing and repression of unpopular opinion happens almost everywhere
where opinions can be expressed, but the immediacy, ease of response and
pay-off make Twitter particularly popular with trolls, sociopaths and
anybody willing to goad their followers into collective sectarian
hysteria. There will always be enough of them willing to tweet before
thinking to pummel into silence everyone but the most determined. Only
ideas at first protected by obscurity can develop and flourish in
environment without boundaries.</p>
<h2>Three pillars of Twitter design</h2>
<p>Twitter earns money by showing ads. There’s another reason to be careful
with any ad-based business beyond worrying about their usually
insatiable hunger for our privacy. Its value is proportional to the
amount of our time it captures.^<span
id="twitter-toxic-5"><a href="#twitter-toxic-5-note">[5]</a></span>^ Seeing ads on
a site you frequent should trigger an examination of how much time you
are willing to spend there.</p>
<p>I disliked Twitter’s design until I realised that its main purposes are
spreading messages and increasing its use. It does those two things
splendidly and kudos to Twitter’s designers.</p>
<p>I am obviously not privy to any internal information, but to me the
foundation of Twitter’s design are three main values: terseness,
immediacy and broadcasting.</p>
<p>Terseness is of course the well known restriction of 140 characters per
tweet because of a technical limitation which does not really exist any
more. Its effect on writing however remains because writing thoughts
longer than 140 characters is awkward and will in newest-tweets-first
Twitter applications always result in a broken reading experience. It is
ill-suited for human dialogue because we don’t express ourselves at
tweet lengths and we don’t hear responses first. Life is not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> and it is not a
coincidence that most messaging applications put newest messages at the
bottom.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t Twitter raise the limit? I can only speculate, but I
believe there are other benefits to Twitter beyond the limit’s role in
Twitter’s brand. Longer text simply requires more effort from writer and
readers and makes the platform less engaging thus hurting both of the
stated Twitter’s goals.</p>
<p>Twitter does not use time much as a design tool beyond a core belief
that real time is the right time to deliver a message and that delivered
messages should be displayed in the opposite order they were sent which
at some point will practically guarantee broken narratives and constant
change of topic.</p>
<p>Most of us can’t effectively multitask because we can’t quickly switch
contexts. We cognitively suffer when we try and reading tweets from
unconnected authors in order in which they came is really just
multitasking at high speed. There is no reason to believe that we listen
as well and care as much as we would if our focus would not be
constantly drawn to the next thing. Ability to listen fully and steadily
is a difficult skill to develop, but quick to atrophy on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter may tolerate a moderate use of its platform, but certainly does
not want it. It will keep suggesting new people to follow no matter how
many you already do to keep the stream of tweets from ever drying up.
Without them you don’t have a reason to constantly check your phone for
new tweets and fewer reasons to post your own.</p>
<p>The other face of broadcasting is building up your audience which is how
you’ll eventually see your followers once you get enough of them to not
know many. And ever so helpful Twitter is here to get you to this point
as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>First it provides a crude privacy model in which either everything is
private or nothing is (ignoring direct messages that are irrelevant for
this article). This not so gentle nudge to make output public is further
supported by ubiquitous leader boards tracking followers, retweets and
favourites, constantly reminding us of everyone’s standing and relying
on our vanity to improve it. None of these would need to be so prominent
if what really mattered was sharing and chatting with your friends.
Putting a scorecard on our every utterance makes sense only if its most
important feature is their popularity.</p>
<p>Hoarding followers and followees has another negative effect beside
making already described ones worse. For historical reasons and because
of web app limitations twitterers often use just one account, so
subscribing to it conflates all author's interests into one stream and
while not merging different communities, it certainly exposes them more
without them having much say in it. This, together with stilted
expression, reduced comprehension and empathy, on a platform that
promotes making an instant idiot of yourself in pursuit of recognition
is, in my opinion, an important contributing factor to many heated
arguments.</p>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of issues I have with Twitter, not even
important ones (e.g. obtuseness of relying on any one source for
important information). Much of what I said is not unique to this
service but a lot of it feels more excessive here. What makes it
different is the platform's growing presence and influence in our
society by its successful co-opting of promoters in us. Doubtless there
is a lot of good that happens on Twitter or because of it, but the
platform is also bringing out the worst in us and I find its damaging
effects more substantial.</p>
<p>Writing this article reminded me of a larger point I have not made
before or not often enough. Technology is not morally neutral or
unipolar let alone inherently positive and it frustrates me that
discussions often try to cast it thus. As a practising technologist I am
obviously not a Luddite, but neither do I assume that everything I am
able to make is good even when made with best intentions. Our creations
shape what we do, how we do it and even who we are and should therefore
be critically examined for what they do for and to us.</p>
<p>As tools transform us and our societies I find pining for previous times
unproductive, but I do not subscribe to technological determinism. We
used freons for decades, but were perfectly capable of finding suitable
replacements when we realised that our fridges would eventually fry us.
But we did have to first realise and accept that.</p>

<p>I know there are other clients. Well, mostly were. Twitter has been
very open with their intention of eventually replacing all of them
with theirs which already is the only one that
matters.<a href="#twitter-toxic-1">↩</a>

<p>Another thing Twitter is not trying to hide. <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/about">Twitter
analytics</a> could hardly sound
more marketing oriented and Twitter’s homepage is all about
following, not creating.<a href="#twitter-toxic-2">↩</a>

<p>There’s <a href="http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com/post/89201006992/this-is-phil-fish-transcript">a
transcript</a>
and while I usually prefer written word, in this case I would
recommend to invest 20 minutes into watching the original
video.<a href="#twitter-toxic-3">↩</a>
4.  <div id="twitter-toxic-4-note"></p>
</div>

<p>Since we can’t control which tweets will be seen by whom and which
won’t, it is impossible in the long term to really shape their
overall perception unless they are sufficiently dehumanised or we
consistently act out only one persona.<a href="#twitter-toxic-4">↩</a>
5.  <div id="twitter-toxic-5-note"></p>
</div>

<p>Corollary of this is that it makes no sense to rely on a purportedly
time-saving services whose revenue mostly comes from
advertising.<a href="#twitter-toxic-5">↩</a></p>
