            <p>I first heard of structured blogging a few days ago and at first I
thought it was an excellent idea. I mean which geek wouldn't like its
promise?</p>
<p>However, the more I think about it, the more skeptical I am. I'm not the
first and other people said it better than I could. Shelley Powers

the need for such a thing since modern publishing tools should provide
more sensible, tailor-made solution. I may be down on WordPress, but
this is something it gets right today. Paul Kedrosky
<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/002215.html">sees</a> user laziness as a
problem, which might limit SB to enterprise as <a href="http://gilbane.com/blog/archives/2005/12/post.html">pointed
out</a> by Frank
Gilbane.</p>
<p>I basically agree with all of them. First I don't like the current
implementation with embedded x-subnode format. I'm trying to move stuff
like CSS and Javascript out of the document and it seems odd that I
would now litter the same document with different kind of inline data.
Contained blocks are a different representation of content and not a
script, so it smells of tag abuse as well.</p>
<p>I like microformats, but that's because I find it clever how you can use
names to add meaning and structure to what you already have. It can be a
cheap way to add value to existing data. In my opinion they are most
suitable for pages that need multiple formats to describe contained data
and each of them represents a fairly small chunk of the whole page.</p>
<p>Then there's a question how you can get this data. I think there are 4
ways you get data from users:</p>
<ol>
<li>it's fun for them to do so</li>
<li>benefits to them by far outweigh the pain of providing the data</li>
<li>by accident</li>
<li>it's forced upon them</li>
</ol>
<p>It certainly isn't fun. It's difficult enough for me to select
categories in which to put a certain post. Often they don't fit in just
one, so which interface would I have to use then?</p>
<p>And why? There are no immediate benefits or at least not any obvious
ones. That strikes option number two.</p>
<p>By accident simply means what we already have. Google seems to be good
at getting information out of unstructured data, but it's certainly not
what SB was supposed to be. Strike number three.</p>
<p>So what we are left with is environment with little choice, more often
referred to as a job. It certainly not a novel idea, although it
probably hasn't been applied to blogs yet. I'm not all that convinced it
will be, but I'm willing to be surprised.</p>
<p>Conclusion? No, thanks (for now).</p>
