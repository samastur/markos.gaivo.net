    I think it was Jon Udell who gave the advice to include information about author and date of publication in the title tag of each document. I think it’s a smashing idea, but I have a problem.

    I have no clue how to do it in WordPress. It seems every WordPress
    <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags#Date_and_Time_tags">
     date or title tag
    </a>
    wants to reside inside of its loop and document title is firmly outside of it. Anyone have any ideas?
