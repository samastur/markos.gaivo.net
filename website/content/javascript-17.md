    I fairly often talk to developers with disdain for Javascript. I don’t blame them, since I used to share it. There are various reasons for it, some more valid than others, but one that almost never comes up is the very thing that bothers me most.

    I was reading about
    <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7" title="Introduction to Javascript 1.7">
     features
    </a>
    promised for Javascript 1.7 which should be a part of Firefox 2.0 and I like lots of them. How wouldn’t I when only few of them can’t be found in Python.

    The thing is, most of the time I have almost absolute control of which version of Python, Java or what have you I’ll use. But when your code lives inside of a browser, you’re pretty much stuck with what’s out there and if my experience is anything to go by then I won’t be using new features widely before next decade.
