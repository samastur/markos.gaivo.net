    This year’s first snow fell couple of days ago and while I enjoy it immensely, I’m getting more and more annoyed by our snowplowers.

    Snowplowing in Slovenia is a state provided service without any business competition and like most such services it sucks. In fact, we relive the same story every year:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     some time in the fall there’s a story published, how everyone is ready for snow this year and there won’t be any problems with our roads
    </li>
    <li>
     we get a correct weather forecast a few days before the first snow
    </li>
    <li>
     snow falls, plowers are nowhere to be seen and there’s a complete mayhem on slovenian roads
    </li>
    <li>
     snowplowers provide some meaningless statistics about resources used and journalists write stories about how they were surprised by the snow
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Now, could you treat your customers and users like this? Probably not.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except if you, like them, are the only provider of vital service. It’s probably still a poor business strategy because even if you are, like telecoms used to be, can you be absolutely sure that this will remain so?
   </p>

    Personally, I’d just like to know how is it possible fo them not to be embarrassed infront of their family and friends.
