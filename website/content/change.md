    I left my last job more than two years ago to start working in my own
    <a href="http://www.neko.si/" title="Neko d.o.o.">
     company
    </a>
    and I never regretted this decision. In fact, I have had so much fun I couldn’t imagine to go and work for some other company ever again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, as saying goes, never say never.
   </p>
   <p>
    I got an excellent opportunity from like-minded people to further my goals of improving the state of Slovenian web, so from 4th of December I split my time between
    <a href="http://www.neko.si/">
     Neko
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.parsek.si">
     Parsek
    </a>
    , where as their head of development I’ll have an opportunity to raise the bar on what can and should be expected from a modern website.
   </p>

    This also means I’ll have less time to work on other things, so if you are not a charity or we haven’t talked yet, then I probably won’t have time to work on your project.
   </p>
   <p>
    As year is coming to an end I’d also like to use this opportunity to wish happy holidays to all of you and all the best in new year.
