    Talk is behind me and I’d like to thank all who came and especially to those, who stayed through the whole thing.

    Looking back, there are certainly things I’d do differently, if I got the chance, but at least it wasn’t a horrendous experience for me and the audience like my last talk a few years ago was.

    I’ll post my slides of dubious value later today or tomorrow at the
    <a href="http://web.zen.si">
     usual place
    </a>
    and I’ll try to prepare a Lessig-like webcast over the weekend. I hope to see everyone next week on Tuesday. Boštjan Ber??i?? will talk about responsibility of publishers on web, a talk that everyone who publishes on the web in Slovenia should probably hear.
