    I added Google ads (again), but with a bit of a twist. They can be seen only on posts at least two months old, so they don’t annoy my few regular readers and are seen only by fly-by visitors, who’ll never return again. Since they are the same people who come to this site by searching for something, it’s also more likely that ads will be beneficial to them. So in a way we all win or at least nobody loses (much). If you think the idea sounds too good to be mine, well, you’re right. It isn’t. It’s

    .

    I also admit to writing misleading title for this post. There are no connections between those three words or at least not in this article, but wouldn’t it be great, if all university students in Slovenia were required to write 3 new wikipedia articles in their final year? By then they should certainly be qualified and experienced enough to meet the level of your average wikipedia post and it wouldn’t add much to their workload.
