    I am not much of a

     YouTube user
    </a>
    , but I have recently started to upload some of my work

     there

    . You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes for products that may never be (especially if you are a

    user).

    I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to our users so please tell us what you think.

    This is also a good time to mention that I donâ€™t lead front-end team at Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our users more deeply than anybody else.
