    I’ve been working on Marela uploader for series60 phones (those with Python support) and have had a great fun discovering the world of user interfaces on mobile devices.

    If you think there’s not enough space on your average web page, you really should try designing an interface for a device with stamp size screen with a resolution of
    <a href="http://www.c64.com/">
     Commodore 64
    </a>
    in full color mode (but luckily with far more colors) and input device that only kids could love. On top of that there’s a limited selection of existing UI controls to chose from and text can’t be too small to remain legible.

    Still, I think the major problems have been solved and I’m maybe a day or so of development and a decent camera phone away from first working version. I’m hoping to get it done by this weekend, but realist in me keeps screaming: “Maybe next week!”
