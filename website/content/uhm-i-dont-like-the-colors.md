    We’ve been working with a talented group of designers, whose work I admired for a long time, on a design for our new service. Initial concept was exactly what we were looking for and the only changes that needed to be made, were consequences of our bad choices earlier on. In fact, everything was great except one thing.

    We didn’t like proposed color schemes.

    Every time I work with a designer, I’m afraid I’ll have to say that. It’s probably the most common complaint they hear and I really hate to join this particular crowd. Sure, they’ve always been graceful (at least the good designers), but I’m certain they wouldn’t mind spiking a voodoo doll of me, given a chance.

    That got me thinking, is there a specific, but very common complaint for every trade out there? I couldn’t recall one for programmers, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. I certainly would love to hear your experiences.
