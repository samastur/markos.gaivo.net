    I’ve just noticed that a lot more time has passed than planned since my last post about Linux. I wanted to write a follow up to installation post a week later, but it completely slipped my mind.

    It’s been a few weeks now and my Linux box has become the place, where I do most of my work. There are three reasons for this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     kioslaves like fish let me work with remote filesystems over various protocols as if they were local
    </li>
    <li>
     abundance of tabs which can be navigated with keyboard (terminal, editor and browser all support them)
    </li>
    <li>
     bookmarks in file dialogs even for remote filesystems make using even a complicated directory layouts a joy
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    There are other things I really like, but it’s really hard to live without those three. The only thing really ruining my happiness is a sucky USB keyboard. So far I had no luck with finding a reasonable replacement.
