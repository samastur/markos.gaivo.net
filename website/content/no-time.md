    I’m writing this post 10 or 11, depending on how you count, days A.i. (after iPhone). Phone-phobic heathen that I am, I would prefer to have an
    <a href="http://www.openmoko.org/">
     open, very hackable
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">
     mobile computer
    </a>
    , which is also a phone, than the other way around.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alas, there’s no point in purchase when there is no free time to do the hacking.
   </p>

    No free time also means forgetting self-imposed deadline for rewriting this blog and having to put up with it for quite some time longer. That is, if there will also be enough time to do some writing. For better or worse I am not giving up hope on that yet.

    Hopefully some of my ideas will crop up in what I am secretly doing at work right now even if it won’t be really what I wanted to do in the first place. It won’t be worse, just different.

    Anyway, with this I fulfilled my quota of at least a post per month for July. Have a great summer.
