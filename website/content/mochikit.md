    Sometimes I’m really glad my brains don’t let my mouth shoot off as quickly as it would like.

    I was checking latest versions of
    <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">
     Prototype
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">
     Dojo
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">
     MochiKit
    </a>
    a couple of days ago and while I liked the first two, I had a much lower opinion of the third. In fact, I couldn’t understand why
    <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">
     Turbogears
    </a>
    has chosen MochiKit as its AJAX library and was about to write a post questioning just that.

    I’m glad I didn’t. MochiKit still wouldn’t be my choice and probably won’t be when I’ll start using existing libraries instead of mine, but that doesn’t make it a bad choice. A lot of thought and effort has been put into its implementation and it shows.

    There are obviously things I dislike about it and the major one being the way it loads dependencies. I despise document.write and I disagree with argument made in comments (Safari’s use of defer on generated scripts). But I guess this is something reasonable minds can disagree on.
