    We came from
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.corse.fr/" rel="homepage" title="Corsica">
     Corsica
    </a>
    vacation recently and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south of the island. It’s a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent an apartment in the old town itself – you might feel as a part of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Typeface used for suggestions was
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans" rel="wikipedia" title="Comic Sans">
     Comic Sans
    </a>
    .
   </p>

    I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more despised and ridiculed
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" rel="wikipedia" title="Typeface">

    </a>
    around. My unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?
   </p>
   <p>
    It obviously doesn’t leave people untouched, since they keep on using it when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers. I’ve also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested in type.
   </p>
   <p>
    Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually means) just as it doesn’t make Madonna a good singer. It does however speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply unmoved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn’t designed for.
   </p>
   <p>
    If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it’s probably more because it is less general, less bland than, say,
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" rel="wikipedia" title="Times Roman">
     Times Roman
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    In the end I have to admit I don’t have a bigger point than simple admission I’m not affronted by it anymore. I can’t muster a will to protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end harmless.
