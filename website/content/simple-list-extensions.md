    I’m not sure how I missed the original announcement of Simple List Extensions (SLE) for feeds, but better late than never.
   </p>
   <p>
    SLE is a very simple specification to extend feeds syntax to better support some common scenarios that weren’t covered with original specifications of RSS and Atom. Previously there was no way to tell feed readers/aggregators to display feed items in fixed order (e.g. feed with most popular stories of the day) or delete items not present in feed anymore (e.g. auction site feed with items matching a query).
   </p>
   <p>
    SLE also adds support for grouping and filtering of feed items, which might not be very useful with you average 10-item feed, but will be, if feeds will indeed become a general mechanism for transporting data and not only a tool to highlight most recent bunch of updates. In any case, you can read a very short

     latest announcement
    </a>
    which includes more explanatory links to why and how they can and already are used.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the way, I’m not sure if any reader apart from beta of IE7 already supports SLE, but I expect that most of them will soon. There’s little reason not to.
