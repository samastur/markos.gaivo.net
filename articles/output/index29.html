  I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked
  <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/" title="John's homepage">
   John Lily
  </a>
  why haven’t they integrated
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.greasespot.net/" rel="homepage" title="Greasemonkey">
   Greasemonkey
  </a>
  into
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="homepage" title="Firefox">
   Firefox
  </a>
  . Wrong question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know was:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Why doesn’t
   <a class="zem_slink" href="http://mozilla.com" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla">
    Mozilla
   </a>
   integrate Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It’s them who decide how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone’s computer and belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)  to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “To whom does a browser belong to?”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation doesn’t need to be. I find
  <a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">
   Platypus extension
  </a>
  a good first step to how a browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even further to their needs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I’m failing to find anything substantial.

  I’m back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn’t publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are places where I’ve been, places where I wouldn’t like to go again and places like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="wikipedia" title="Namibia">
   Namibia
  </a>
  , where you ask yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country and its fantastic people, so I won’t even try where so many have failed before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn’t miss it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia. Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3 letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other news I will be giving a talk at Web 2.0 Expo in
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" rel="wikipedia" title="Berlin">
   Berlin
  </a>
  on 23rd titled “Easy Deployment of Site-Extensions with a Browser Plugin”. If Berlin is too far, then you can also hear it this coming Wednesday at 19.00 in Kiberpipa at our regular Spletne urice talks.

  Jonathan
  <a href="http://spyced.blogspot.com/2008/08/app-engine-conclusions.html#">
   wrote
  </a>
  his thoughts about
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://appengine.google.com" rel="homepage" title="Google App Engine">
   App Engine
  </a>
  . They are well worth a read if you are thinking about using it, but haven’t so far. I used App Engine sporadically for a couple of months on a project of mine, but I finally gave up and ended porting my code to pure
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.djangoproject.com" rel="homepage" title="Django (web framework)">
   Django
  </a>
  , which admittedly wasn’t too hard to do at this point in time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of my reasons match Jonathan’s. There were too many rough edges to feel really productive and too much time was wasted on trying to find out if problem lies in poor documentation, incomplete implementation or stupid programmer. I probably will never get answers to questions like how can a simple Django view that doesn’t do anything beside rendering a static template, consume above expected amount of CPU and risk triggering quota blockage, but right now I really don’t care anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Integrating
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google" rel="crunchbase" title="Google">
   Google
  </a>
  accounts is indeed easy, but it is also very shallow to the point of being practically useless.  You basically can only rely on fact that reference to a particular user won’t change. Anything else you may think you know (like an email address), can’t be relied upon. You can’t create an account and you can’t even control login form of your service. In essence you don’t have your own users, you can just offer a service to Google’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  For me this was one of two major reasons for my decision. Every person who would need an account to use what I am building would need to agree to Google’s
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service" rel="wikipedia" title="Terms of service">
   TOS
  </a>
  agreement which defines many things, among others the highest level of privacy I can offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other reason was that current limitations of App Engine really lead you to rely heavily on provided APIs, which may be similar to stuff out there (like Django), but aren’t anywhere close to being a drop-in replacement. This can be — depending on application you’re writing — a heavy investement in a platform you don’t control a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Put more profanely, you are a Google’s bitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having said all this, I do think App Engine is a very valuable service. If you want to write a mini-app, a web tool like
  <a href="http://simonwillison.net/" title="Simon's homepage">
   Simon
  </a>
  <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jul/29/jsonhead/" title="Post about json-head service">
   does
  </a>
  , then App Engine is brilliant. You can do this easily with little deployment and zero administration hassle. In fact I can’t think of any other service better suited to this task.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m sure this is not the only scenario in which App Engine makes sense and there are others I haven’t named or thought of. Issues, like accounts, can with some effort be solved now. But App Engine also isn’t (yet) what some of us were hoping for and it’s prudent to really think through what you want, what you need and what App Engine actually offers.
