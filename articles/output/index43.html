    I left my last job more than two years ago to start working in my own
    <a href="http://www.neko.si/" title="Neko d.o.o.">
     company
    </a>
    and I never regretted this decision. In fact, I have had so much fun I couldn’t imagine to go and work for some other company ever again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, as saying goes, never say never.
   </p>
   <p>
    I got an excellent opportunity from like-minded people to further my goals of improving the state of Slovenian web, so from 4th of December I split my time between
    <a href="http://www.neko.si/">
     Neko
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.parsek.si">
     Parsek
    </a>
    , where as their head of development I’ll have an opportunity to raise the bar on what can and should be expected from a modern website.
   </p>
   <p>
    This also means I’ll have less time to work on other things, so if you are not a charity or we haven’t talked yet, then I probably won’t have time to work on your project.
   </p>
   <p>
    As year is coming to an end I’d also like to use this opportunity to wish happy holidays to all of you and all the best in new year.

    I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who’s a recent Python convert and he was explaining to me which parts of Python are not to his liking. Mostly he had reasonable objections.
   </p>
   <p>
    I can understand his wish for strong typing, but since lack of it is not a problem that affected me yet, I’m not bothered by it. I’ll take his word that objects pickled on Windows are not transferable to Linux and that certainly can suck. But it was probably the smallest problem that resonated the strongest with me, since it was something that has annoyed me previously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bisect module doesn’t let you specify comparison function. It obviously doesn’t need to, since you can define your own comparison methods on your classes, but still, it would be nice if its documentation included a hint for those who won’t look at module’s code or think of simply trying. You know, people like me.
   </p>
   <p>
    It got me thinking that I don’t find all modules in standard library of the same quality and I suspect I’m not the only one. I don’t mean to or honestly can disparage anyone, since I haven’t seen any code in standard library that would be worse than mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, which modules do you think would benefit from some work and how could an eager person, with some time on his hands, help them improve?

    Dear LazyWeb,
   </p>
   <p>
    I’m looking for a shop that sells
    <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/770" title="Tablet's homepage">
     Nokia 770 Internet Tablet
    </a>
    and is willing to ship it for a reasonable fee to Slovenia. Our
    <a href="http://www.teleray.si/" title="Official Slovenian Nokia distributor">
     official Nokia distributor
    </a>
    has failed me miserably in this regard.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thank you.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Update (22.12.2006):
    </strong>
    Expansys managed to deliver navigation kit without the tablet. Hopefully this problem will be amicably resolved after holidays (since nobody could be reached yesterday afternoon).
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Update (29.12.2006):

    Tablet arrived today and man, do I love this little machine already.
