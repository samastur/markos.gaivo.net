    <strong>
     Update:
    </strong>
    It seems access to Google Page Creator is limited, so it would make sense if I spend some time explaining what I meant. What Google Page Creator (GPC) allows you to do, is to build a simple website using your browser. It differentiates itself from majority of such tools (but not all of them) in that it allows you to do this through a WYSIWYG interface, where you can easily see exactly how your page will look like when you’re finished with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are things I like. Page creator is easy to use and you get a direct feedback on everything you do. Sadly, the overall impression is less positive, since there’s plenty I dislike:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     GPC is incredibly slow. True, G4 Powerbook is not a top of the line anymore, but there are tons of web applications with similar capabilities (some of them mine) which don’t drag their feet so much.
    </li>
    <li>
     As others have noted, HTML produced is simply crap. Font tags should be extinct by now and there’s really no excuse to produce them in 2006. You can get a glimpse of the horror by looking at the source of my page (linked at the end of this post).
    </li>
    <li>
     There are plenty of designs, but they mostly differ in color schemes used. It’s hard to find one that isn’t simply dull.
    </li>
    <li>
     GPC is simplified almost to the point of uselessness. You can stitch static pages together and build a simple static website, but there’s not much else you can do. I expected more. Something, anything that would make you believe the final result was done in the age of blogs, wikis and mash-ups and not 5-6 years ago.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In short, it’s hardly an improvement over what was already available out there. You can see

     a list

    of python wishes. There’s stuff I agree with, some with which I don’t and stuff I simply don’t understand. But what caught my eye was:

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Things I wouldn’t do:
     <br/>
     Put up with any significant-whitespace whining. Here 99% of the Python community is with me. I think there is a meme that Python people are close-minded to suggestions for changes in the language. I think there is significant truth to that. But sometimes everyone else is just completely wrong. I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent their code. If you want to mis-indent your code you are an idiot. If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being absurd.

   <p>
    Precisely. Yesterday was our regular
    <a href="http://web.zen.si/">
     web talk evening
    </a>
    , which is often followed by a lively debate. As usual we covered all sorts of topics, one of which was Python. To paraphrase a part of it:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     A: I don’t like Python because of significant whitespace.
     <br/>
     B: Do you indent your code?
     <br/>
     A: Yes, of course.
     <br/>
     B: And the problem is?
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I can’t understand how this complaint doesn’t die. I can understand that some other language can tickle their fancy. People have different tastes and if some people like it rough, who am I to judge. But why in the world would you wish for a feature you’d never be stupid enough to use?
