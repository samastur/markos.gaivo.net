    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://bokardo.com" rel="blog" title="Joshua Porter"&gt;
     Joshua Porter’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that’s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" rel="homepage" title="Facebook Connect"&gt;
     Facebook Connect
    &lt;/a&gt;
    as Facebook “owning” their users.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    They are right, but it doesn’t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Awareness -&amp;gt; Sign-up -&amp;gt; First-time use -&amp;gt; Engagement -&amp;gt; Referral
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Using Facebook Connect (or
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://oauth.net" rel="homepage" title="OAuth"&gt;
     OAuth
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://openid.net" rel="homepage" title="OpenID Foundation"&gt;
     OpenID
    &lt;/a&gt;
    …) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It’s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to “full” members to make such commitment more enticing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I’ll let you know how it went.

    I’ve been writing less lately, which had little to do with summer laziness and more with me thinking about publishing on the web.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Many have said that Internet (or Web) is not a television, but neither is it a magazine or a book. Yet I find myself again and again leaning on preconceptions picked up from my favorite medium. So this summer has been spent exploring my preconceived notions and trying to find out which of them still make sense on the web and how to tackle those which don’t.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And the result of this exploration? I still don’t like WordPress, so I might go about writing my own publishing platform which would offer me an opportunity to test some of newfound ideas. Or I won’t, recognizing vast amount of time needed and I’ll end up only writing an article or two. But what I’m certain I will do is write less.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In a world where every monkey can publish so almost every one of us eventually does restraint is a virtue. There were too many posts that neither benefited me nor those who came across them. Maybe I won’t change the signal-noise ratio, but I will put less crap out there in absolute terms.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Related to all these thinking is a recent announcement of
    &lt;a href="http://hyperscope.org/"&gt;
     HyperScope
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Doug Engelbart’s vision of
    &lt;a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augment-132082.opml"&gt;
     Open Hyperdocument System
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (link may not work in every browser) has been a source of many ideas this summer and it’s certainly nice to finally have available a system to test at least some of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yesterday I talked about influence of language and tag design on ratio between the number of unique and all tags. I haven’t discussed why this number would be interesting and what would it tell us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s start with a simple graph:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Tag space" class="image" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/tag-graph.jpg"/&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Blue circles represent objects. Connections represent tags and rectangulars are pages with hits for a specific unique tag. As we can see, all images but one have two tags (number of connections from a circle) and the most popular tag is attached to 4 images (number of connections from a rectangular).
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What ratio tells us is an average frequency of a given tag (how many connections does a typical rectangular have). The higher it is, more hits will be returned by search.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, tag connections and rectangulars also form a path between objects. Therefore higher ratio also means a better connected graph with (again on average) shorter paths between different objects. For example if we look at the red path on example graph then left top object is at least two clicks away from the top one and at least four clicks away from the bottom right one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If tag browsing and searching are main methods of exploration, then a loner like the most right circle is practically unreachable and more tags an object has, the better chances it has to be discovered.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Now, I presented a very simplified graph with a fairly even distribution of tags. Normally you wouldn’t have this. A word like cat is far more likely to be used as a tag than something like hippopotamus resulting in creation of super-nodes with far more connections to objects than system’s tag frequency ratio.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With time you’d also expect this ratio to grow. Vocabulary, especially of commonly used words, is far more limited than number of pictures people can take and with time it becomes harder to create a unique tag. Flickr has tens or even hundred millions of tags, but certainly far less unique ones.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Graph topography and things like super-nodes not only skew the picture, they can also change the perception and application use. I’ll write more about how in few months, when there will be more knowing and less guessing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tags</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/tags_.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-02-08T18:01:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2006-02-08:articles/tags_.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tags are increasingly popular and rightfully so. I’ve built my share of applications with their own taxonomies and I’m certain they simply don’t work. They sort of work if they were built for specialized needs and are used only by trained, disciplined people with excellent organizational skills.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Which means almost never.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Tags (aka folksonomies) are messy. There’s no real system, any bozo can attach whatever it wants and you’d be a fool to blindly trust any specific tag. They are the worst possible system apart from everything else we tried so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why we decided to implement them in Marela. Language used on Marela is Slovene and that led to slightly different design that commonly found elsewhere.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We decided to treat multiple words separated with spaces as one tag and use commas as a delimiters between different tags. First reason for this is that tagging something like
    &lt;em&gt;
     New Zealand
    &lt;/em&gt;
    becomes more natural. The other was that in Slovene compound words like handbag are very often separate words. For example, handbag would be
    &lt;em&gt;
     ro??na torbica
    &lt;/em&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another problem, which we haven’t tackled yet, but probably will have to, is that Slovene is
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_grammar" title="Short description on Wikipedia"&gt;
     a complicated language
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in ways that make tagging a nasty problem. There are six cases, but nominative is usually used. Still three different grammatical numbers (singular, dual and plural) together with three different genders (masculine, feminine and neutral) leave multiple options for the same thing. If you were looking for
    &lt;em&gt;
     blue
    &lt;/em&gt;
    objects, you’d need to search at least for tags
    &lt;em&gt;
     modra
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     modro
    &lt;/em&gt;
    ,
    &lt;em&gt;
     modri
    &lt;/em&gt;
    and
    &lt;em&gt;
     modre
    &lt;/em&gt;
    . Right now you have to do this manually.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And then there are problems that plaque other tagging systems as well. Most common of them are misspelled words, like
    &lt;em&gt;
     Wein
    &lt;/em&gt;
    instead of
    &lt;em&gt;
     Wien
    &lt;/em&gt;
    for Vienna.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All these lead to a fairly flat tag space with a ratio of 5.6 between all tags and unique ones. I’m not sure how it would change if we treated spaces differently or even what is a common ratio for other languages and other applications. I’m guessing it wouldn’t change the ratio too much because of noun cases, but it remains to be investigated.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, why does it matter?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Well, that’s a matter for another post, which I’ll probably write tomorrow.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As noted in my previous post, we changed the way image navigation works on Marela. I already described “philosophical” reason for previous behavior and in this post I intend to visit other reasons and lessons learned.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I liked the old behavior because it made every page recognizable and there were no side effects, no special cases that would require different handling and make interface bigger. It made under-developed mathematician in me feel all fuzzy and warm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I mean by recognizable is that you could quickly tell where on Marela you are just by looking at the displayed page. Hence it should be easy to know how to proceed and what you can do. Very predictable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Except it didn’t matter and nobody cared.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    New behavior brought special cases and I’m quite certain we haven’t met all of them yet. Example of one would be navigating through set of images grouped by a tag and deleting that tag from the current image. Where does that put you?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The picture obviously can’t be a part of that set anymore so its neighbors can’t be from the set either. That’s why you fall back to photo-stream of the author. Except that most people still expect to be inside of the tag-stream. There wouldn’t be much change if we stayed there, only side-effects would be different. We could only select how to confuse users, not if.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As it happens, it’s not a big deal either. It’s confusing at first, but not for very long, so nobody cares.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What I relearned is that a tight mathematical model without side-effects, is not necessarily intuitive to human mind. In a way, we compensate for any small idiosyncrasies in a story our brains write from what we do. As with any good writing, we have guidelines that make us write better stories, but at the end it’s not they which matter, but the story itself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Interface should only help telling it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What iPod teaches us about modern (web) design</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/what-ipod-teaches-us-about-modern-web-design.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-01-23T14:41:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2006-01-23:articles/what-ipod-teaches-us-about-modern-web-design.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    According to Steve Jobs at Macworld Apple sold 14 million iPods in last quarter of 2005 and 32 million during the whole year. iPod remains by far the most popular portable mp3 player even though it’s neither the cheapest or the most feature laden of available options.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what is it that makes iPod so popular and what does that tell us?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For the purpose of this post I’ll talk about the whole family of iPod products as one, since I believe that my points can be more or less equally applied to all of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     1. Easy interface = happy users
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Using iPod is very easy and when something is easy to do, it’s more likely to also be enjoyable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    iPod achieves this mainly by using familiar elements (playlists, slideshows…) and sticking to simple usage model. Even wheel is just an evolved volume knob from hi-fi equipment. Which doesn’t make it less innovative.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Exceptions to the mental model are expensive, since they significantly raise the cognitive burden and should therefore be reserved only for occasions when their benefits far outweigh their downsides.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     2. Number of features is not important. Their selection is.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As already noted, iPod isn’t the player with most features. It’s not even the player with most features per buck.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s a common fallacy to think you need more features than competition. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t add any. A product should certainly meet baseline expectations and have features most of its customers expect. But you should be careful that those it has significantly add to the purpose of the tool.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Don’t try to build a swiss army knife.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     3. If you build it (expansion option), they will come (developers).
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You can’t add every feature and you shouldn’t even if you could. However you should make it possible for other developers to build on top of your product. This way everybody wins.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Your budget can be smaller, majority is not bothered with features it doesn’t want or need, but somebody else can add them for those who do. That’s why web services matter and you should think about adding them if you haven’t yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     4. Less is more (minimalism rules)
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Less design, less features, less burden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s like going on a trip. You can’t take everything you might possibly need with you. You have to decide what’s useful or important enough and make it fit within limitations imposed on you either by airlines or your own body.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     5. Looks matter
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nobody wants to watch ugly stuff. If we are going to look at it, then it should be pleasant to do so.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Flashy designs might get your attention at first, but they age quickly more often than not. Light, understated design might not be so eye catchy, but it’s this inconspicuousness that makes them usable over longer periods of time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To sum up, when I think of iPod, two words come to my mind. Easy and restrained. Are these the same two words you’d use to describe your website?
   &lt;/p&gt;
