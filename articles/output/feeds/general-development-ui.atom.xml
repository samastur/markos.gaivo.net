  I really dislike headaches and although I don’t get them as often as I used to, they are usually not as easy to shake of. That’s why we have several different pills in our home to battle this nuisance. I recently noticed that one of them, Plivadon, has its name stamped in Braille on the box (click for a bigger picture):
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a class="imageL" href="http://www.marela.si/photos/6581/?original" title="Full size picture"&gt;
   &lt;img alt="A box of Plivadon pill's" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/ndkvtPUIDCSxe-m9hlVPA8rI8xc.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  It’s great that
  &lt;a href="http://www.pliva.com/"&gt;
   Pliva
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (Plivadon’s maker) makes its product more accessible to blind people. At the same time, this is also a good example of how difficult good accessibility is.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It’s a common misconception that all blind people either know how to read Braille or can learn how to. In fact, a large part if not majority of them don’t and can’t. The reason for this is that you can learn Braille only if tips of your fingers are sensitive enough and that’s usually the case only for those who were born blind or became blind in their youth.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But blindness can be caused by an accident later in life or by various diseases like diabetes, which means it’s far more common among older people, who through years of working with hands lost the necessary sensitivity in their fingers. They are in such cases forced to cope with their usual methods such as being very organized about where they put things.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Pliva (and other companies) could help them more. They could make the shape and size of the box more unique. They could stamp an easily recognizable pattern on parts of the box, just like they did with Braille. Anything that can make the tactile feedback more unique would probably help.

   &lt;a name="pliva1-2006-06-06"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Alas they, as more often than not we, don’t do what they easily could.
 &lt;/p&gt;

    Braille sign on Plivadon’s box is distinguishing enough mark for as long as there isn’t a similarly sized box and a sign at the approximately same position.

   observation
  &lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I don’t have data to back or refute his observations, but I did check our logs to see how often is our help accessed and the number is so low that I’ve seem to have talked about it with practically everyone who actually visited it. Sure enough, all of them belong to more experienced users who probably need it the least
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#invhelp1-2005-12-04"&gt;
    1
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a name="invhelp01-2005-12-04"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So let’s assume that Harris is correct and inexperienced users don’t access help. I think there are three basic questions you’re faced with when designing a help system
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#invhelp2-2005-12-04"&gt;
    2
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a name="invhelp02-2005-12-04"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  :
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   How do you get users to discover and use help?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   How do you meet the needs of those who do?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   What about the rest?
  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Harris’ observation doesn’t change questions, but it does lead to possibly different answers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;
  1. How do you get users to discover and use help?
 &lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The least you can do is to make it accessible from a standard place, which is in the top right corner and to make it easily recognizable. If everyone says it’s Help, you should too and don’t hide it with small font size (we might be guilty of this) or inappropriate colors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We tried to go further than this by also offering various means of help in close proximity to where we think our members might appreciate it. It’s still too early for any conclusive remarks, but compared to general use of our help, I’d say it’s showing good promise.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;
  2. How do you meet the needs of those who do?
 &lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If Harris is right and I believe he probably is, then this translates to what are the needs of experienced users and how to meet them?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  What we have so far is simply a FAQ of real questions that have been asked previously. It’s amazing how many companies think FAQ is a place where they should put questions they’d like users to ask.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It’s not much and certainly not enough, but there’s been little need for more so far. What I’d like to add is tips and other ways to deepen the knowledge of those, who’d like to do so, but so far we’ve lacked the time.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I’ve certainly discovered that absence of tutorials teaching basic use of our service is not a problem. At least not so far.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;
  3. What about the rest?
 &lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  No matter how hard you work to make your product simple to use and how easy it is to get to help for it, there will be people who won’t know how to use it and either can’t or won’t use help. How do you help them?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One way is to make mistakes really cheap. Everything that delays a successful completion of intended task is a burden, a price payed not in money, but in satisfaction. We’re trying really hard to make it as cheap as possible with lightning fast pages and non-destructive interfaces where it’s easy to fix mistakes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I think it’s already clear that this approach works very well. I believe it’s partially responsible why our help section is rarely used.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There are options like tooltips, that we haven’t used yet. There are probably options we haven’t thought of. We’ll try new stuff and when we do, I’ll let you know what we’ve learned.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notes:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a name="invhelp1-2005-12-04"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   Before I go on I should point out that it would be nice to think that we got our interface right and most people don’t need to visit our help section. However, without data to back that up it could also mean help is just too difficult to find. It’s something we’ll have to investigate.

   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a name="invhelp2-2005-12-04"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   I assume that all conscientious designers strive for a design that would remove the need for help. I also recognize that this is often not possible.
