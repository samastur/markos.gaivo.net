    Probably the most common misfortune every creator encounters is that something he thought up doesn’t or won’t work as planned and it has to be changed. In a way half of work is done by just recognizing and accepting that it doesn’t work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But how do you do that?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our change of image navigation was in retrospect quite easy. As a friend said: “You don’t have to satisfy everyone, but you should satisfy at least somebody.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It wasn’t easy for me, because I was quite attached to it and I failed to recognize it as a problem. And this wasn’t even a close call.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, how do you decide when to give in to requests conflicting with your vision?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Relying on a personal hunch might work for a while, but as a long-term strategy it’s probably not much better than rolling a dice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
