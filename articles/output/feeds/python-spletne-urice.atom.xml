    of python wishes. There’s stuff I agree with, some with which I don’t and stuff I simply don’t understand. But what caught my eye was:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Things I wouldn’t do:
     &lt;br/&gt;
     Put up with any significant-whitespace whining. Here 99% of the Python community is with me. I think there is a meme that Python people are close-minded to suggestions for changes in the language. I think there is significant truth to that. But sometimes everyone else is just completely wrong. I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent their code. If you want to mis-indent your code you are an idiot. If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being absurd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Precisely. Yesterday was our regular
    &lt;a href="http://web.zen.si/"&gt;
     web talk evening
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is often followed by a lively debate. As usual we covered all sorts of topics, one of which was Python. To paraphrase a part of it:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     A: I don’t like Python because of significant whitespace.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     B: Do you indent your code?
     &lt;br/&gt;
     A: Yes, of course.
     &lt;br/&gt;
     B: And the problem is?
    &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I can’t understand how this complaint doesn’t die. I can understand that some other language can tickle their fancy. People have different tastes and if some people like it rough, who am I to judge. But why in the world would you wish for a feature you’d never be stupid enough to use?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    I’m online again and have been reading news of the last few days.  So I’m kind of late to
    &lt;a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/friendship-and-hand-holding.html"&gt;
     discussion
    &lt;/a&gt;
    about friendliness of communities.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My personal experience with Python community has been absolutely wonderful. I’ve written
    &lt;a href="no-language-feature-is-optional.html"&gt;
     posts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that could be seen as inflammatory, but the response I’ve got was just amazing. I haven’t been nailed to the cross for it and have learned a lot from people I admire, who took the time to leave a comment on my blog for which I’m really grateful. A couple of days ago I
    &lt;a href="searching-for-atom-feed-generator.html"&gt;
     needed help
    &lt;/a&gt;
    developing atom feeds and got it immediately.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I find Python community very friendly and forthcoming, but I also believe Ian is right that Ruby might feel more friendly simply because a kind of youthful innocence. I wouldn’t really know, since I don’t use the language or follow up their discussions. I have however experienced in other communities the problem of a disconnect between old timers and newer members, who don’t share cultural history just yet. I think this is inevitable, since experience unlike knowledge can’t be easily given.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand, I have a different problem with web related talks we’re organizing. It’s been our goal from the start to use talks as a conduit for slovenian web community building, which hasn’t happened to the extent I was hoping for. Our talks are well attended, but at the end our audience mostly leaves, which kind of saddens me. I’d like to get them more engaged, but I have no idea if the problem lies with us, organizers, or is just a result of slovenian culture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I guess community building is just hard.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
