  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A while ago I agreed to organizing a series of talks about web and web technologies. They were and will be the cause for occasional outburst of Slovene on this blog. As Slovene speaking readers already know, the first one will be tomorrow at 19.00 in
    &lt;a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org"&gt;
     Cyberpipe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is a rather cool place I almost never visit, because I’m weird and don’t like it all that much. But if you’re into net art, free wifi, cyber cafe and like meeting like-minded people, than it’s the place for you in Ljubljana.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I agreed to a job with no salary, fame or groupies and I did it whorishly quickly, because I thought it would be really cool to get Slovenian web community be, well, more communal. A better thinker than me would certainly notice that I’m not actually necessary for this plan to work and so could leave this task to someone else. But I’m as much a sucker for leaving my mark and doing it my way as any dog out there. Or better a cat. Yes, definitely a cat. Tomcat that is.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, here we are, on the eve of first talk, which I’m certain will be a great (success) as all others will be and I’m working on November’s and December’s schedule, which are not coming together as easily as I’ve hoped. Series is aimed at experienced part of community and there are awfully lot of Wednesdays for something as small as
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia"&gt;
     Slovenia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I mean 20 thousand square kilometers and 2 million people. If any smaller it wouldn’t be a country, it would be a city.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Therefore I’m asking both of my readers which option is least annoying:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Forget a regular schedule. Have a talk when you can, but let it be worthwhile.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Have a regular schedule, but keep it regular with more basic talks (e.g. how to build your first web page).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Have a regular schedule, but keep it regular by having regular speakers.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I like variety, even in food, although between you and me, I could eat pasta every day. I’d prefer to have as many different speakers as possible, but I’d rather listen to the same lot (if good) then nobody or even worse, to talks I can’t care about anymore. How about you?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    P.S: If there’s anyone that would like to give a talk and is willing to come to Cyberpipe, please let me know. Reasonable costs of transportation can be reimbursed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
