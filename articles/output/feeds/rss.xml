&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; seminal, but for wrong reasons and I will think twice next time I feel optimistic. The most positive thing I can think of about 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning and text  editor wiped out most of the early version of this review which is one of the reasons why it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not contribute to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae. Since I seem to be mostly fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of the excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest personal change last year was freelancing again full time, which at times felt all consuming. It was a medium success. I am not in danger of being hungry, am working on things I find interesting and have learned a lot including that I don't like the "traditional" model of freelancing with many, relatively short engagements. Instead I prefer to work on longer lasting projects with at most two clients at a time which is what I am doing now. I am not sure if this could still be adequately described as freelancing or consulting, but it certainly does not feel like employment either. Finding correct label will probably wait until I have a need for one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side I learned how I work best by failing some of my clients for which I still feel guilty and ashamed. Another problem is answering what do I do. For example I spend a lot of time last year improving my &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; related skills, but effectively did not use them professionally and this year is shaping to be similar. There is a saying that you are in whatever business your customers think you are in. Clearly theirs and my perception were not aligned and it would be nice if this year I succeeded in answering at least who gets to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly freelancing also changed my perception of time which I never felt I have an abundance of. I can't tell how much of a book I will read in an hour or how many useful lines of code will be produced, so wasting it just gives me some vague feeling of loss. However because money is fungible, charging for time makes such loses more comparable to some things I care about (and admittedly to neither of my examples). It probably is a form of greed even though me getting something is rarely what it ends up being compared to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a trap which somewhat paradoxically becomes worse if you raise your rate. I have colleagues who have difficulty taking time off because they now know almost exactly how much that would cost them. But it can also be useful if turned into a question if what I am doing right now is the most appropriate use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I set a goal of giving at least one talk in 2016. I did 4, most of them on the same topic and while I enjoyed presenting, I do not expect to do it in 2017. Neither will I be setting development goals for this year even as I am expecting to learn a lot. In 2016 I learned 4 different Javascript frameworks because of work and I expect what I do to guide most of what I learn this year as well. Open source work will likely suffer too, but I plan to continue being involved in organising local Javascript events which I started to do at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion of the general state of journalism sank to a new low last year, but there are exceptions and I was happy to be involved with &lt;a href="https://podcrto.si"&gt;Pod ƒçrto&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this year I am trying to reduce my obligations and ambitions, it would be great if I could do more work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more, but mostly not the kind of things I had in mind when I set that goal. Hopefully this year will be better including keeping the old promise of having a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to find time for a new hobby. Something that is fun to do even when you have only minutes to spare, is not computer related and is hopefully more tactile, like building with Legos that I already have. Also spend more effort learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still all this is is just tweaking life as it passes. Last year and especially last few months of it, as I observed world with increasing horror, I kept thinking what the right response should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it isn't doing nothing. There are no problems needing me to be solved, but even my own experience proves that getting involved can matter. Life fully lived is more than just a pursuit of personal comfort and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; once said that you should always ask yourself what is the most important problem that needs solving and how you can contribute most. I feel stuck responding to his two part challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, identifying the most important problem to work on, suffers from abundance of choice. Climate change with all its consequences, EU project continuing viability, rise of (rightwing) populism etc. Right now I am pretty much unqualified to meaningfully help with any of them, but I do feel slightly more qualified about an issue that connects them all which is the role of modern media and the way (mis)information spreads. As this post is already tryingly long, I won't go &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f00ec8cdfcb#.uipgk19ru"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/12/eleven-tweets.html#more"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/facebooks-walled-wonderland-is-inherently-incompatible-with-news-media-b145e2d0078c#.ddp42t5wu"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-americans-against-trump-can-learn-from-the-failures-of-the-israeli-opposition?intcid=mod-latest"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2955021/shirtless-trump-saves-drowning-kitten/#pq=VD83C8"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which does not make choosing ways to get involved easier. Writing code is unlikely to be helpful if you are not a part of the teams working on platforms that matter (Facebook, Twitter) and I never will be. Even if I were, ideas currently discussed are unlikely to be effective or can be just as easily abused to make things worse. There might be space for activism. Having done it before, I know how difficult it can be and how temperamentally unsuited I am for it. Before I worry too much about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to achieve my goals, I need to establish &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't feel much certainty at the moment, but what I am certain of is that the idea of "Reader", that kept cropping up on this site, is dead. I would still love to have such tool, but last year thoroughly proved it is at best a solution to a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 12:15:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-29:articles/2016-review.html</guid><category>2016</category><category>review</category><category>annual review</category></item><item><title>Books I read in 2016</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;...were very few. This year has been a reading disaster. I have never read so few books since I learned to read. My list would be even shorter if it did not contain three items ambitiously described as books by publishers. If I change nothing this year, I will definitely change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say I did not read much. It was a US presidential election year and I read too many things that on the whole did not do me much good except further erode an already low opinion of mainstream journalism. I may (or not) come back to this in my annual review of past year. Also watched too much (good) TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly all my reading was done either on tablet (first 4 items) or Kindle (last two), both of which worked well and neither being perfect. However I expect this to be more common as convenience can't be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read much, but I can still recommend one book: The Oracle of Oil. Generally, I don't see a point in reading biographies and reading a book from the author you personally know also carries a risk of what to do if you don't like their work. Luckily for me Mason's book is excellent. A meticulously researched and engaging story of a father of peak oil kept me interested all the way through and left me pondering the power of wishful groupthink and (in)effectiveness of data substantiated arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured/dp/1491901942/"&gt;AngularJS Up &amp;amp; Running&lt;/a&gt; by  Shyam Seshadri and Brad Green . A good introduction to 1.x version of AngularJS framework that gives you a solid overview of what can be done and how you should go about it without getting lost in advanced specifics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI57PWo6HRAhVNeVAKHSQCA0kQFggaMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fweb-development%2Freactjs-essentials&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFce0pG40bQZb-AQTvziAd2Uxkowg"&gt;React.js Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by Artemij Fedosejev. A gentle introduction to React.js and Flux avoiding rest of React's ecosystem as it does building complex, multi-screen applications. Still good first book to read on the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/the-secrets-behind-great-one-on-one-meetings"&gt;The Secrets Behind Great One-On-One Meetings&lt;/a&gt; by Esther Schindler. From a series of recent O'Reilly short books (booklets?). Excellent guide on how to conduct effective one-on-one meetings (or receving one). Recommended for everyone with a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/designing-culture.pdf"&gt;Designing Culture&lt;/a&gt; by Kristi Woolsey. Another booklet, but not as good as the previous one. Too few practical examples and because of author's background it focuses mainly on using architecture/design to influence culture. Still useful if you are in a position to influence or change working environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Mujer Alta by Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n. Not so much a book as a short story, but it was the first longer text I read mostly in Spanish (with &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of help from interleaved English text). It is a story I suspect just did not age well since 19th century when it was written. Skip unless you are learning Spanish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Oil-Maverick-Geologists-Sustainable/dp/0393239683/"&gt;The Oracle of Oil: A Maverick Geologist's Quest for a Sustainable Future&lt;/a&gt; by Mason Inman.&lt;/strong&gt; An engaging biography of M.K.Hubbert, the father of "peak oil". It is more than just a story of a brilliant man pushing an unpopular view and provides an opportunity to draw lessons still relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I will achieve my plan of reading more books than last year as I could hardly read fewer. Some fiction would be nice and another Spanish book would be welcome too. My goal is again 15 books, but if I don't read at least 10, then, well... I have a year to think of a suitable punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 22:38:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-01:articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html</guid><category>review</category><category>book</category><category>Books</category></item><item><title>Audacity to run an email server</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/audacity-to-run-an-email-server.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I normally don't write about foreign politics on these pages. Those who know me should already know what I think and others would be smart to ignore pontifications of a random Internet stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have been following US presidential elections closely this year. Main result of this unhealthy obsession was waste of my time, nerves and that my already low opinion of news media has been further lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for this are many, but at the top of them it has to be how the "story" of Clinton emails was and still keeps being reported. Matthew Yglesias at Vox &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13500018/clinton-email-scandal-bullshit"&gt;explained it&lt;/a&gt; better than anyone else I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are a couple, to the story tangential, parts that bug me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, it‚Äôs certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Hillary Clinton ‚Äî who is, again, his wife ‚Äî also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what many of us, non-presidents, do too. However it seems obvious from hysterical reactions of last few months that most people actually do find it unusual. It is a view which in its essence is not any different from "why are you hiding it if you have done nothing wrong".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did we screw up development of Internet so much that it became more normal to be suspicious of running your own instance of a service that was &lt;strong&gt;designed and intended&lt;/strong&gt; to be used thusly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only describe it as sad that distributed, democratized infrastructure is not just too complex for everyone to run, but that doing so has now been legitimized as cause of suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 09:08:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-11-07:articles/audacity-to-run-an-email-server.html</guid><category>Internet</category><category>elections</category><category>media</category><category>news</category><category>email</category><category>server</category><category>freedom</category></item><item><title>DVD backups</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/dvd-backups.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finished backing up about 200 DVD disks to a drive, most of which are about 10 years old. Took me about 10 days and 1.5TB of space. I just copied data as it was the quickest and doesn't lose any information. Drive may complain and require change of a DVD region, but once they are copied, computer doesn't care anymore. Glad this part is over now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them needed cleaning, but I really had problems only with three, two of which remains not copied. As it happens it is also one of those on which I can find no visible scratch whatsoever. It used to work, because I've seen it. It does make you wonder what life span of disks really is, even when they were professionally produced. If you have any, I heartily recommend making a backup of them on some other medium. Unless of course they themselves are a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping disks regularly for 10 days does make you notice their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, especially hubs that keep disks in place with varying degrees of zeal. It is astonishing how many designs have been used over years and how few of them are actually pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown of teeth is probably the worst. Like a pitbull unwilling to release a disk until it is visibly bended or a tooth broken. Unless case is made of hard plastic there is really no excuse for using this design. Or any other "pluck" hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank god there are patents (as there always are) to prevent everyone converging to those few "push-to-release" that are actually nice to use. How could I after all value my life appropriately without it being spiced with needless hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I intend to process them into a different, smaller formats that require less space and are easier to (re)use. I am not in a hurry as this step still seems laborious and may also result in some content being lost. I am also thinking of making an additional copy together with file hashes so I could, in principle, recover if any of files gets corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: processing our CD collection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 20:01:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-15:articles/dvd-backups.html</guid><category>backup</category><category>dvd</category><category>data</category><category>movies</category><category>ownership</category></item><item><title>Long vacations</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/long-vacations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:37:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-02:articles/long-vacations.html</guid><category>vacation</category><category>work</category><category>benefits</category><category>rest</category><category>test</category></item><item><title>Conference programs</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/conference-programs.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We went hiking and exploring north of Spain after this year's &lt;a href="http://http://ep2016.europython.eu/"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt;. Predictably this also involved a lot of frustrations with available WiFi connections. Mobile networks often worked better, but far from reliably so. It is amazing to see how poorly most websites and apps still work in such (common) scenarios with rare exception like Gmail Android app. Keeping all our devices powered required significant planning and spare batteries where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complained about this before and while it is sad to see how little has changed, this post is not about failing services. It is about web conferences which I believe contribute &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; to this sad state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond a talk or two on ServiceWorkers or PouchDB there seems to be little interest from conference organisers to help educate developers on how to develop services that continue to work well when connection is spotty &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; battery low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not because users wouldn't care. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2Hlb22mZM#t=1m05"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt; there are hundreds of battery apps, downloads of which go into 100+ millions. In my own field work I saw that when given choice mobile users will pick services that work better. By which I mean those that use less bandwidth, work more reliably and are easier on battery. I can only think of very few services that have network effects strong enough to be safe from removal, but even their use can be negatively impacted by users limiting or changing their use of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk proposal on web's energy use has been widely rejected. It happens. But more disappointingly I failed to find other talks on this or similar topics. Every conference has a right to decide which topics it finds important, but when one is ignored by all of them, it may be correct to conclude that it simply does not matter to community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is true and web developers expect to punt this problem to OS (Android and iOS), then that is a mistake. First, because &lt;strong&gt;this is our job&lt;/strong&gt; that nobody else can do equally well. And second, because operating systems are getting better at pointing out problematic apps to users who are willing to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hunch is that most developers are simply not aware of these issues. A good conference program for me is not just about what is currently pertinent, but also what should be. Maybe we could have fewer talks on web game development to find space for topics that affect billions of people every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2016 09:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-08-23:articles/conference-programs.html</guid></item><item><title>Windows</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/windows.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/"&gt;travel computer&lt;/a&gt; this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt; for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually &lt;em&gt;the best Windows&lt;/em&gt; so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 15:17:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-07-02:articles/windows.html</guid><category>experience</category><category>windows10</category><category>window</category><category>ux</category><category>notebook</category><category>laptop</category><category>asus</category><category>zenbook</category><category>travel</category></item><item><title>Web skills</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/web-skills.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While following news about Brexit developments and its impact on FTSE100, my wife and I wondered how many people work for companies that are included in that index. Wikipedia provides &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index"&gt;a list of FTSE100 companies&lt;/a&gt; including their employees numbers, but without the total that interested us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel like summing them manually as it is tedious, slow and error prone. Luckily I do not have to as this is a nice example how we can use even limited web development skills to solve every day problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I needed to do is select table cells in last column, transform their values to numbers that Javascript understands and sum them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a modern browser this can be accomplished by opening developer tools and executing two lines of code in its console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.slice.call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#constituents tbody td:last-child&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.innerText.replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(/,/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the first line does is select last table cell (&lt;code&gt;td:last-child&lt;/code&gt;) in each company row of the table (&lt;code&gt;#constituents tbody&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;[].slice.call&lt;/code&gt; is used to make the resulting list a Javascript array because it is easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In second line we first transform the list of page elements to a list of cell values, by picking them with &lt;code&gt;.innerText&lt;/code&gt;, removing comma separators (&lt;code&gt;.replace(/,/g, '')&lt;/code&gt;) and changing them to numbers using &lt;code&gt;parseInt&lt;/code&gt;. This is immediately followed with a call to &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; which sums all the values in our list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively I could have also used &lt;a href="http://jquery.com"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; library already included on Wikipedia pages and not much more code to get to the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that according to Wikipedia there are 5,618,496 people working for FTSE100 companies out of 31.59m in total.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2016 18:45:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-06-27:articles/web-skills.html</guid><category>web</category><category>skills</category><category>programming</category><category>trick</category><category>wikipedia</category></item><item><title>image-diet2 and pyimagediet</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of years ago I hacked together a small Django app called &lt;a href="http://"&gt;image-diet&lt;/a&gt; which automatically compresses images processed by Easy Thumbnails as they are uploaded to a website. Its code was atrocious with configuration for external tools baked in, it only worked with &lt;a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails"&gt;Easy Thumbnails&lt;/a&gt; and Python2 and...I could go on, but it worked and at &lt;a href="http://aptivate.org"&gt;Aptivate&lt;/a&gt; we have been using it successfully ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally found time and rewrote the whole thing. New version is now called &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; because it is completely backwards incompatible and I screwed up versioning of the original one. Mea culpa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's implemented as a Django storage backend augmenting default one, but can easily be added as a mixin to any other so it should work no matter which tool or backend you use to upload files. Supporting new compression tools or changing configuration of existing does not require a new release or poking in virtualenv anymore. It is better &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://image-diet2.readthedocs.org/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; and is not limited to 2.x branch of Python anymore. You really should give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;image-diet2 is actually a thin Django wrapper around separately packaged &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyimagediet"&gt;pyimagediet&lt;/a&gt; that actually process files. My hope is that others may find it useful enough to use it on non-Django projects. It also comes with a tool to compress images and generate configuration file tailored to your system. If you can think of anything else that would make integration even easier, then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few bits still missing, but functionality is mostly complete. What I plan to do next is to test different configurations to find how well they work and what are their tradeoffs. Prior useful work such as &lt;a href="http://www.css-ig.net/png-tools-overview"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; exists, but I'd like tests to be more expansive and in reusable format. They need to be easily replicable by anyone as their versions of processing tools might give different results than mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:00:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-19:articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html</guid><category>low-bandwidth</category><category>django</category><category>compression</category><category>image</category><category>optimisation</category></item><item><title>Books I read in 2015</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;2015 was a year of completely &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;missed plans&lt;/a&gt; and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: &lt;em&gt;Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://diytoolkit.org/"&gt;DIY Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/"&gt;Missing Person&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Modiano.&lt;/strong&gt; The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/"&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/"&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt; by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/"&gt;The Shepherd's Crown&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/"&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf.&lt;/strong&gt; A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058"&gt;Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
