Those who know me should already know what I think and others would be smart to ignore pontifications of a random Internet stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have been following US presidential elections closely this year. Main result of this unhealthy obsession was waste of my time, nerves and that my already low opinion of news media has been further lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for this are many, but at the top of them it has to be how the "story" of Clinton emails was and still keeps being reported. Matthew Yglesias at Vox &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13500018/clinton-email-scandal-bullshit"&gt;explained it&lt;/a&gt; better than anyone else I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are a couple, to the story tangential, parts that bug me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, it’s certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Hillary Clinton — who is, again, his wife — also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what many of us, non-presidents, do too. However it seems obvious from hysterical reactions of last few months that most people actually do find it unusual. It is a view which in its essence is not any different from "why are you hiding it if you have done nothing wrong".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did we screw up development of Internet so much that it became more normal to be suspicious of running your own instance of a service that was &lt;strong&gt;designed and intended&lt;/strong&gt; to be used thusly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only describe it as sad that distributed, democratized infrastructure is not just too complex for everyone to run, but that doing so has now been legitimized as cause of suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 09:08:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-11-07:articles/audacity-to-run-an-email-server.html</guid><category>Internet</category><category>elections</category><category>media</category><category>news</category><category>email</category><category>server</category><category>freedom</category></item><item><title>DVD backups</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/dvd-backups.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finished backing up about 200 DVD disks to a drive, most of which are about 10 years old. Took me about 10 days and 1.5TB of space. I just copied data as it was the quickest and doesn't lose any information. Drive may complain and require change of a DVD region, but once they are copied, computer doesn't care anymore. Glad this part is over now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them needed cleaning, but I really had problems only with three, two of which remains not copied. As it happens it is also one of those on which I can find no visible scratch whatsoever. It used to work, because I've seen it. It does make you wonder what life span of disks really is, even when they were professionally produced. If you have any, I heartily recommend making a backup of them on some other medium. Unless of course they themselves are a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping disks regularly for 10 days does make you notice their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, especially hubs that keep disks in place with varying degrees of zeal. It is astonishing how many designs have been used over years and how few of them are actually pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown of teeth is probably the worst. Like a pitbull unwilling to release a disk until it is visibly bended or a tooth broken. Unless case is made of hard plastic there is really no excuse for using this design. Or any other "pluck" hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank god there are patents (as there always are) to prevent everyone converging to those few "push-to-release" that are actually nice to use. How could I after all value my life appropriately without it being spiced with needless hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I intend to process them into a different, smaller formats that require less space and are easier to (re)use. I am not in a hurry as this step still seems laborious and may also result in some content being lost. I am also thinking of making an additional copy together with file hashes so I could, in principle, recover if any of files gets corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: processing our CD collection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 20:01:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-15:articles/dvd-backups.html</guid><category>backup</category><category>dvd</category><category>data</category><category>movies</category><category>ownership</category></item><item><title>Long vacations</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/long-vacations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:37:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-02:articles/long-vacations.html</guid><category>vacation</category><category>work</category><category>benefits</category><category>rest</category><category>test</category></item><item><title>Conference programs</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/conference-programs.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We went hiking and exploring north of Spain after this year's &lt;a href="http://http://ep2016.europython.eu/"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt;. Predictably this also involved a lot of frustrations with available WiFi connections. Mobile networks often worked better, but far from reliably so. It is amazing to see how poorly most websites and apps still work in such (common) scenarios with rare exception like Gmail Android app. Keeping all our devices powered required significant planning and spare batteries where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complained about this before and while it is sad to see how little has changed, this post is not about failing services. It is about web conferences which I believe contribute &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; to this sad state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond a talk or two on ServiceWorkers or PouchDB there seems to be little interest from conference organisers to help educate developers on how to develop services that continue to work well when connection is spotty &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; battery low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not because users wouldn't care. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2Hlb22mZM#t=1m05"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt; there are hundreds of battery apps, downloads of which go into 100+ millions. In my own field work I saw that when given choice mobile users will pick services that work better. By which I mean those that use less bandwidth, work more reliably and are easier on battery. I can only think of very few services that have network effects strong enough to be safe from removal, but even their use can be negatively impacted by users limiting or changing their use of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk proposal on web's energy use has been widely rejected. It happens. But more disappointingly I failed to find other talks on this or similar topics. Every conference has a right to decide which topics it finds important, but when one is ignored by all of them, it may be correct to conclude that it simply does not matter to community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is true and web developers expect to punt this problem to OS (Android and iOS), then that is a mistake. First, because &lt;strong&gt;this is our job&lt;/strong&gt; that nobody else can do equally well. And second, because operating systems are getting better at pointing out problematic apps to users who are willing to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hunch is that most developers are simply not aware of these issues. A good conference program for me is not just about what is currently pertinent, but also what should be. Maybe we could have fewer talks on web game development to find space for topics that affect billions of people every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2016 09:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-08-23:articles/conference-programs.html</guid></item><item><title>Windows</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/windows.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/"&gt;travel computer&lt;/a&gt; this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt; for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually &lt;em&gt;the best Windows&lt;/em&gt; so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 15:17:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-07-02:articles/windows.html</guid><category>experience</category><category>windows10</category><category>window</category><category>ux</category><category>notebook</category><category>laptop</category><category>asus</category><category>zenbook</category><category>travel</category></item><item><title>Web skills</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/web-skills.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While following news about Brexit developments and its impact on FTSE100, my wife and I wondered how many people work for companies that are included in that index. Wikipedia provides &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index"&gt;a list of FTSE100 companies&lt;/a&gt; including their employees numbers, but without the total that interested us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel like summing them manually as it is tedious, slow and error prone. Luckily I do not have to as this is a nice example how we can use even limited web development skills to solve every day problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I needed to do is select table cells in last column, transform their values to numbers that Javascript understands and sum them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a modern browser this can be accomplished by opening developer tools and executing two lines of code in its console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.slice.call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#constituents tbody td:last-child&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.innerText.replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(/,/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the first line does is select last table cell (&lt;code&gt;td:last-child&lt;/code&gt;) in each company row of the table (&lt;code&gt;#constituents tbody&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;[].slice.call&lt;/code&gt; is used to make the resulting list a Javascript array because it is easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In second line we first transform the list of page elements to a list of cell values, by picking them with &lt;code&gt;.innerText&lt;/code&gt;, removing comma separators (&lt;code&gt;.replace(/,/g, '')&lt;/code&gt;) and changing them to numbers using &lt;code&gt;parseInt&lt;/code&gt;. This is immediately followed with a call to &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; which sums all the values in our list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively I could have also used &lt;a href="http://jquery.com"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; library already included on Wikipedia pages and not much more code to get to the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that according to Wikipedia there are 5,618,496 people working for FTSE100 companies out of 31.59m in total.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2016 18:45:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-06-27:articles/web-skills.html</guid><category>web</category><category>skills</category><category>programming</category><category>trick</category><category>wikipedia</category></item><item><title>image-diet2 and pyimagediet</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of years ago I hacked together a small Django app called &lt;a href="http://"&gt;image-diet&lt;/a&gt; which automatically compresses images processed by Easy Thumbnails as they are uploaded to a website. Its code was atrocious with configuration for external tools baked in, it only worked with &lt;a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails"&gt;Easy Thumbnails&lt;/a&gt; and Python2 and...I could go on, but it worked and at &lt;a href="http://aptivate.org"&gt;Aptivate&lt;/a&gt; we have been using it successfully ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally found time and rewrote the whole thing. New version is now called &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; because it is completely backwards incompatible and I screwed up versioning of the original one. Mea culpa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's implemented as a Django storage backend augmenting default one, but can easily be added as a mixin to any other so it should work no matter which tool or backend you use to upload files. Supporting new compression tools or changing configuration of existing does not require a new release or poking in virtualenv anymore. It is better &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://image-diet2.readthedocs.org/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; and is not limited to 2.x branch of Python anymore. You really should give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;image-diet2 is actually a thin Django wrapper around separately packaged &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyimagediet"&gt;pyimagediet&lt;/a&gt; that actually process files. My hope is that others may find it useful enough to use it on non-Django projects. It also comes with a tool to compress images and generate configuration file tailored to your system. If you can think of anything else that would make integration even easier, then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few bits still missing, but functionality is mostly complete. What I plan to do next is to test different configurations to find how well they work and what are their tradeoffs. Prior useful work such as &lt;a href="http://www.css-ig.net/png-tools-overview"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; exists, but I'd like tests to be more expansive and in reusable format. They need to be easily replicable by anyone as their versions of processing tools might give different results than mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:00:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-19:articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html</guid><category>low-bandwidth</category><category>django</category><category>compression</category><category>image</category><category>optimisation</category></item><item><title>Books I read in 2015</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;2015 was a year of completely &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;missed plans&lt;/a&gt; and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: &lt;em&gt;Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://diytoolkit.org/"&gt;DIY Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/"&gt;Missing Person&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Modiano.&lt;/strong&gt; The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/"&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/"&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt; by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/"&gt;The Shepherd's Crown&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/"&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf.&lt;/strong&gt; A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058"&gt;Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in its last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent about a third of last year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin, confirmed that I am indeed in no way an equestrian person and culminating in my first visit to a doctor on my travels. Not only did I not "salvage summer" as &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I hoped&lt;/a&gt;, I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some decidedly less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family spent a lot of time in hospitals and I with them. Any time is really too much, but at least I can solace myself with good outcomes. Still, it would be great if none of us entered one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go through the list of things &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I planned&lt;/a&gt; a year ago as I did none of them. Life intervened, but I also did not use first half of the year as well as I should. However last couple of months were great. Reader still lives only in my head, but I did finally rewrite image-diet which is now called &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; and is in pretty much everything better than previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and by the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year). I do plan to deepen my knowledge of Python3, ES2015 and ES2016 now that I have more opportunity to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tumultuous year and yet I feel calmer than ever which I mostly attribute to &lt;a href="http://www.tm.org/"&gt;TM&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to judge its other effects on me as they are clearly not as pronounced, but feeling more peaceful even under stressful circumstances makes meditating worthwhile enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to expect of 2016, but it feels seminal. The image stuck in my head for last couple of days was my first week at university. Totally clueless and wrong about where  life will take me, but knowing it will be different afterwards. In a way this year feels like one of last opportunities to &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt; redefine who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest change next year will be professional. I have happily worked for Aptivate for four years and hope to continue doing so in the future, but not solely. I will be available for freelance work. &lt;a href="mailto:markos@gaivo.net"&gt;Talk to me&lt;/a&gt; if you will need help from someone with &lt;a href="http://si.linkedin.com/in/markosamastur"&gt;my background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal for this year is to present a talk at a conference as I haven't done that in a while. "Competition" for slots at interesting ones is strong enough that giving even one will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that I am trying too avoid being too ambitious with my plans as I expect this year to be busy as it is. I plan to do a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter and read more than I did this year. I will write publicly more as it would be difficult to write less and I am again not bereft of things to share (although most of them are not ready yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/vim-notebook"&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; hacked &lt;a href="http://bitterjug.com/"&gt;Mark's&lt;/a&gt; journal script to fit my needs. I can now summon it at any time and commit new entry without switching applications. My plan is mainly to jot down non-obvious problems and solutions I encounter, but I'd love to hear what others write in their work journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending few hours each month on tooling seems sensible. I have rejigged my set up late last year and difference is palpable. Development takes less effort with better results. Removing friction from doing the right thing is already a win, but if I can make it easier than doing wrong things, then that's golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case I have few firm plans for next year. Getting freelancing off the ground and presenting at conference should keep me busy enough. I expect to be overworked at least some of the time and yet it's been a while since I have felt so optimistic. Let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 18:21:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-03:articles/2015-review.html</guid><category>2015</category><category>review</category><category>annual review</category></item><item><title>Homeconf</title><link>http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to a bunch of topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only went to two this year. Instead I have collected links to talks I was interested in. However I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. I never get nearly as much out of them as when I listen in a dimly lit conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence I recently tried to replicate conference experience at home. I have downloaded the talks&lt;sup id="sf-homeconf-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1" class="simple-footnote" title="What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download?"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and dedicated a full day to watching them. It was brilliant. I especially liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that I could focus very much as I can at conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line-up perfectly matched my interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when I needed more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However not everything is better and there are aspects I have missed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all interesting talks are publicly available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussions about talks or ideas provoked by talks with other attendees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(ab)using power of pausing talks may interfere with your uptake as it can fragment talk's narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these I miss discussions the most. &lt;a href="http://friedcell.si/"&gt;Fry&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with a cool idea of starting a (video) talk "book club". The idea, which obviously needs a better name, is to meet fortnightly or so and have a discussion around talk everyone agreed to listen beforehand. It seems like a well balanced proposal to me, but I am curious to hear what others think about. Who would be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-homeconf-1"&gt;What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download? &lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">markos</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2015 18:40:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-12-18:articles/homeconf.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
