Wikipedia provides &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index"&gt;a list of FTSE100 companies&lt;/a&gt; including their employees numbers, but without the total that interested us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel like summing them manually as it is tedious, slow and error prone. Luckily I do not have to as this is a nice example how we can use even limited web development skills to solve every day problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I needed to do is select table cells in last column, transform their values to numbers that Javascript understands and sum them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a modern browser this can be accomplished by opening developer tools and executing two lines of code in its console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.slice.call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#constituents tbody td:last-child&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.innerText.replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(/,/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the first line does is select last table cell (&lt;code&gt;td:last-child&lt;/code&gt;) in each company row of the table (&lt;code&gt;#constituents tbody&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;[].slice.call&lt;/code&gt; is used to make the resulting list a Javascript array because it is easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In second line we first transform the list of page elements to a list of cell values, by picking them with &lt;code&gt;.innerText&lt;/code&gt;, removing comma separators (&lt;code&gt;.replace(/,/g, '')&lt;/code&gt;) and changing them to numbers using &lt;code&gt;parseInt&lt;/code&gt;. This is immediately followed with a call to &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; which sums all the values in our list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively I could have also used &lt;a href="http://jquery.com"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; library already included on Wikipedia pages and not much more code to get to the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that according to Wikipedia there are 5,618,496 people working for FTSE100 companies out of 31.59m in total.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="web"></category><category term="skills"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="trick"></category><category term="wikipedia"></category></entry><entry><title>image-diet2 and pyimagediet</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-01-19T21:00:17+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-19:articles/image-diet2-and-pyimagediet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Couple of years ago I hacked together a small Django app called &lt;a href="http://"&gt;image-diet&lt;/a&gt; which automatically compresses images processed by Easy Thumbnails as they are uploaded to a website. Its code was atrocious with configuration for external tools baked in, it only worked with &lt;a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails"&gt;Easy Thumbnails&lt;/a&gt; and Python2 and...I could go on, but it worked and at &lt;a href="http://aptivate.org"&gt;Aptivate&lt;/a&gt; we have been using it successfully ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally found time and rewrote the whole thing. New version is now called &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; because it is completely backwards incompatible and I screwed up versioning of the original one. Mea culpa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's implemented as a Django storage backend augmenting default one, but can easily be added as a mixin to any other so it should work no matter which tool or backend you use to upload files. Supporting new compression tools or changing configuration of existing does not require a new release or poking in virtualenv anymore. It is better &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://image-diet2.readthedocs.org/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; and is not limited to 2.x branch of Python anymore. You really should give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;image-diet2 is actually a thin Django wrapper around separately packaged &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyimagediet"&gt;pyimagediet&lt;/a&gt; that actually process files. My hope is that others may find it useful enough to use it on non-Django projects. It also comes with a tool to compress images and generate configuration file tailored to your system. If you can think of anything else that would make integration even easier, then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few bits still missing, but functionality is mostly complete. What I plan to do next is to test different configurations to find how well they work and what are their tradeoffs. Prior useful work such as &lt;a href="http://www.css-ig.net/png-tools-overview"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; exists, but I'd like tests to be more expansive and in reusable format. They need to be easily replicable by anyone as their versions of processing tools might give different results than mine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="low-bandwidth"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="compression"></category><category term="image"></category><category term="optimisation"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2015</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-01-04T13:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-04:articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;2015 was a year of completely &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;missed plans&lt;/a&gt; and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: &lt;em&gt;Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://diytoolkit.org/"&gt;DIY Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/"&gt;Missing Person&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Modiano.&lt;/strong&gt; The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/"&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/"&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt; by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/"&gt;The Shepherd's Crown&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/"&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf.&lt;/strong&gt; A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058"&gt;Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in its last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent about a third of last year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin, confirmed that I am indeed in no way an equestrian person and culminating in my first visit to a doctor on my travels. Not only did I not "salvage summer" as &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I hoped&lt;/a&gt;, I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some decidedly less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family spent a lot of time in hospitals and I with them. Any time is really too much, but at least I can solace myself with good outcomes. Still, it would be great if none of us entered one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go through the list of things &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I planned&lt;/a&gt; a year ago as I did none of them. Life intervened, but I also did not use first half of the year as well as I should. However last couple of months were great. Reader still lives only in my head, but I did finally rewrite image-diet which is now called &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; and is in pretty much everything better than previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and by the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year). I do plan to deepen my knowledge of Python3, ES2015 and ES2016 now that I have more opportunity to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tumultuous year and yet I feel calmer than ever which I mostly attribute to &lt;a href="http://www.tm.org/"&gt;TM&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to judge its other effects on me as they are clearly not as pronounced, but feeling more peaceful even under stressful circumstances makes meditating worthwhile enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to expect of 2016, but it feels seminal. The image stuck in my head for last couple of days was my first week at university. Totally clueless and wrong about where  life will take me, but knowing it will be different afterwards. In a way this year feels like one of last opportunities to &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt; redefine who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest change next year will be professional. I have happily worked for Aptivate for four years and hope to continue doing so in the future, but not solely. I will be available for freelance work. &lt;a href="mailto:markos@gaivo.net"&gt;Talk to me&lt;/a&gt; if you will need help from someone with &lt;a href="http://si.linkedin.com/in/markosamastur"&gt;my background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal for this year is to present a talk at a conference as I haven't done that in a while. "Competition" for slots at interesting ones is strong enough that giving even one will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that I am trying too avoid being too ambitious with my plans as I expect this year to be busy as it is. I plan to do a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter and read more than I did this year. I will write publicly more as it would be difficult to write less and I am again not bereft of things to share (although most of them are not ready yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/vim-notebook"&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; hacked &lt;a href="http://bitterjug.com/"&gt;Mark's&lt;/a&gt; journal script to fit my needs. I can now summon it at any time and commit new entry without switching applications. My plan is mainly to jot down non-obvious problems and solutions I encounter, but I'd love to hear what others write in their work journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending few hours each month on tooling seems sensible. I have rejigged my set up late last year and difference is palpable. Development takes less effort with better results. Removing friction from doing the right thing is already a win, but if I can make it easier than doing wrong things, then that's golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case I have few firm plans for next year. Getting freelancing off the ground and presenting at conference should keep me busy enough. I expect to be overworked at least some of the time and yet it's been a while since I have felt so optimistic. Let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="2015"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Homeconf</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-12-18T18:40:04+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-12-18:articles/homeconf.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to a bunch of topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only went to two this year. Instead I have collected links to talks I was interested in. However I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. I never get nearly as much out of them as when I listen in a dimly lit conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence I recently tried to replicate conference experience at home. I have downloaded the talks&lt;sup id="sf-homeconf-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1" class="simple-footnote" title="What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download?"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and dedicated a full day to watching them. It was brilliant. I especially liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that I could focus very much as I can at conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line-up perfectly matched my interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when I needed more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However not everything is better and there are aspects I have missed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all interesting talks are publicly available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussions about talks or ideas provoked by talks with other attendees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(ab)using power of pausing talks may interfere with your uptake as it can fragment talk's narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these I miss discussions the most. &lt;a href="http://friedcell.si/"&gt;Fry&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with a cool idea of starting a (video) talk "book club". The idea, which obviously needs a better name, is to meet fortnightly or so and have a discussion around talk everyone agreed to listen beforehand. It seems like a well balanced proposal to me, but I am curious to hear what others think about. Who would be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-homeconf-1"&gt;What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download? &lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Late 2014 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-25T23:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-01-25:articles/late-2014-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining
  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0"&gt;
   Charlie Brooker’s 2014 Wipe
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . A must watch is
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis"&gt;
   Adam Curtis’
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0#t=28m23s"&gt;
   segment
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov"&gt;
   Vladislav Surkov
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I
  &lt;a href="40.html"&gt;
   became 40
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1"&gt;
    [1]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
  &lt;strong&gt;
   not
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2"&gt;
    [2]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"&gt;
   quantified self
  &lt;/a&gt;
  movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.
  &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading"&gt;
   Again
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
   mjp
  &lt;/a&gt;
  against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It
  &lt;em&gt;
   is
  &lt;/em&gt;
  something to keep an eye on this year.

  As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don’t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best:
  &lt;em&gt;
   The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and The Quiet American

    Smut: Stories

   A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can’t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.

    Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3

    Pure

     Soldiers of Salamis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Javier Cercas.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/"&gt;
    The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.
  &lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024"&gt;
     The Quiet American
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Graham Greene.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn’t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.
  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish
  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567"&gt;
   GEB
  &lt;/a&gt;

  Disappointed I stopped using Twitter at the end of 2011 and have since visited it mostly to follow up specific references. As a medium I found it lacking but ignorable until recently. While I was reading about the aptly named
  &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/nUX1A"&gt;
   Jacobinghazi affair
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I felt the urge to tweet and pronounce Twitter as possibly
  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samastur/status/476707986006880256"&gt;
   more toxic than Facebook
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This article has been provoked by
  &lt;a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/"&gt;
   Tomaž’s
  &lt;/a&gt;
  polite disagreement and is my late attempt to explain what I couldn’t on Twitter.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  My objections
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Leon Wieseltier recently described Twitter as
  &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118125/leon-wieseltier-responds-alain-de-bottons-attack-twitter"&gt;
   a place of infinite discharge of emotion and promotion
  &lt;/a&gt;
  where nothing intellectually or linguistically substantial can be accomplished. It is a great and true enough description of Twitter.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Over the years a number of articles have discussed effects of new media on society in its largest sense. While I am interested in those my comment was mainly about Twitter’s role in shaping how individuals and communities think, communicate and behave.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In blogging heyday I thoroughly disliked celebration of rapid exchange of half-baked ideas. Making them smaller and exchange more rapid is not an improvement. Ideas have always been cheap and plentiful when untested and inspiring to the unwitting. Twitter is vast and there may be much worth reading, but chances are most of what you will read will be soon forgotten fluff. Creating on a medium like Twitter is hard since most things worth saying can’t be clearly expressed in 140 characters, nuance is valued even less than continuity and every good tweet can be buried in a pile of inane responses.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One of the reasons why I originally stopped using Twitter was realisation that I found tweets from a fair number of otherwise congenial and intelligent people regularly off-putting. Twitter did not suddenly found their previously hidden depravity, instead its forced brevity of semi-public discourse made a great deal of it sound like movie informants wearing a wire. It is a great demonstration of how dialogue changes when we think others are listening and an insidious tool for normalising blanket snooping, much of it our own.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Research has shown that our brains keep adapting to their use and improving one skill often leads to deterioration of another or as McLuhan put it: “Every extension is also an amputation.” I lost count of people describing their difficulty with reading longer, more slowly developing articles after an expectation of instant gratification has been built by a steady diet of short ones. It doesn’t get more instant than a tweet and Twitter’s interface is optimised for non-discriminative reading of a never ending stream of tweets.
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-1-note" id="twitter-toxic-1"&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  Can this really be good for a thinking person?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My tweet which led to this piece was provoked by an absolutely absurd argument closely matching Alan Jacob’s description of
  &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2013/12/twitter-at-its-worst.html"&gt;
   Twitter at its worst
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Maybe worst, but certainly not rare. Of course arguments with all the negative baggage are not exclusive to Twitter, but Twitter does seem a more emotive medium than most of them. Discussions on Twitter are commonly a sad sight because it isn’t built for dialog. It is a marketing machine and works best when used as such.
  &lt;sup&gt;

  Unsurprisingly millions of its users conform to its design hints by sharing content or less obviously with signalling group membership by snarking and sloganeering at sometimes only imagined opposition.

  about the nature of online fame recently made rounds and I can’t recommend it enough. Fame can appear without being sought and the longer it lasts, the more likely it is that the famous will become a stand-in for a concept to which public often responds negatively. This is especially unpleasant and difficult to deal with when the negative concept is tied not to what you did, but who you are or are perceived to be.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Twitter (as previously noted) tweets may be written with a recipient in mind, but can be seen by anyone so all of them contribute to our public image without it being in our control.
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-4-note" id="twitter-toxic-4"&gt;
    [4]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  Controlling tweets comprehension and propagation by relying on cultural norms to differentiate audiences does not work because those norms may not be well known and are certainly not accepted by everyone.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We speak when we want to pass on an idea. Amplifying ideas of others can be worthy, but we are more enriched when new ideas are created and explored. The really interesting ones can be controversial, rough and in need of a nurturing environment in which to develop. Twitter is not that place.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mobbing and repression of unpopular opinion happens almost everywhere where opinions can be expressed, but the immediacy, ease of response and pay-off make Twitter particularly popular with trolls, sociopaths and anybody willing to goad their followers into collective sectarian hysteria. There will always be enough of them willing to tweet before thinking to pummel into silence everyone but the most determined. Only ideas at first protected by obscurity can develop and flourish in environment without boundaries.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Three pillars of Twitter design
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Twitter earns money by showing ads. There’s another reason to be careful with any ad-based business beyond worrying about their usually insatiable hunger for our privacy. Its value is proportional to the amount of our time it captures.
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-5-note" id="twitter-toxic-5"&gt;
    [5]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  Seeing ads on a site you frequent should trigger an examination of how much time you are willing to spend there.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I disliked Twitter’s design until I realised that its main purposes are spreading messages and increasing its use. It does those two things splendidly and kudos to Twitter’s designers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am obviously not privy to any internal information, but to me the foundation of Twitter’s design are three main values: terseness, immediacy and broadcasting.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Terseness is of course the well known restriction of 140 characters per tweet because of a technical limitation which does not really exist any more. Its effect on writing however remains because writing thoughts longer than 140 characters is awkward and will in newest-tweets-first Twitter applications always result in a broken reading experience. It is ill-suited for human dialogue because we don’t express ourselves at tweet lengths and we don’t hear responses first. Life is not
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!"&gt;
   Jeopardy!
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and it is not a coincidence that most messaging applications put newest messages at the bottom.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So why doesn’t Twitter raise the limit? I can only speculate, but I believe there are other benefits to Twitter beyond the limit’s role in Twitter’s brand. Longer text simply requires more effort from writer and readers and makes the platform less engaging thus hurting both of the stated Twitter’s goals.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Twitter does not use time much as a design tool beyond a core belief that real time is the right time to deliver a message and that delivered messages should be displayed in the opposite order they were sent which at some point will practically guarantee broken narratives and constant change of topic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Most of us can’t effectively multitask because we can’t quickly switch contexts. We cognitively suffer when we try and reading tweets from unconnected authors in order in which they came is really just multitasking at high speed. There is no reason to believe that we listen as well and care as much as we would if our focus would not be constantly drawn to the next thing. Ability to listen fully and steadily is a difficult skill to develop, but quick to atrophy on Twitter.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Twitter may tolerate a moderate use of its platform, but certainly does not want it. It will keep suggesting new people to follow no matter how many you already do to keep the stream of tweets from ever drying up. Without them you don’t have a reason to constantly check your phone for new tweets and fewer reasons to post your own.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The other face of broadcasting is building up your audience which is how you’ll eventually see your followers once you get enough of them to not know many. And ever so helpful Twitter is here to get you to this point as quickly as possible.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  First it provides a crude privacy model in which either everything is private or nothing is (ignoring direct messages that are irrelevant for this article). This not so gentle nudge to make output public is further supported by ubiquitous leader boards tracking followers, retweets and favourites, constantly reminding us of everyone’s standing and relying on our vanity to improve it. None of these would need to be so prominent if what really mattered was sharing and chatting with your friends. Putting a scorecard on our every utterance makes sense only if its most important feature is their popularity.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Hoarding followers and followees has another negative effect beside making already described ones worse. For historical reasons and because of web app limitations twitterers often use just one account, so subscribing to it conflates all author’s interests into one stream and while not merging different communities, it certainly exposes them more without them having much say in it. This, together with stilted expression, reduced comprehension and empathy, on a platform that promotes making an instant idiot of yourself in pursuit of recognition is, in my opinion, an important contributing factor to many heated arguments.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  In closing
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This is not an exhaustive list of issues I have with Twitter, not even important ones (e.g. obtuseness of relying on any one source for important information). Much of what I said is not unique to this service but a lot of it feels more excessive here. What makes it different is the platform’s growing presence and influence in our society by its successful co-opting of promoters in us. Doubtless there is a lot of good that happens on Twitter or because of it, but the platform is also bringing out the worst in us and I find its damaging effects more substantial.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Writing this article reminded me of a larger point I have not made before or not often enough. Technology is not morally neutral or unipolar let alone inherently positive and it frustrates me that discussions often try to cast it thus. As a practising technologist I am obviously not a Luddite, but neither do I assume that everything I am able to make is good even when made with best intentions. Our creations shape what we do, how we do it and even who we are and should therefore be critically examined for what they do for and to us.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As tools transform us and our societies I find pining for previous times unproductive, but I do not subscribe to technological determinism. We used freons for decades, but were perfectly capable of finding suitable replacements when we realised that our fridges would eventually fry us. But we did have to first realise and accept that.
 &lt;/p&gt;

    a transcript

   Since we can’t control which tweets will be seen by whom and which won’t, it is impossible in the long term to really shape their overall perception unless they are sufficiently dehumanised or we consistently act out only one persona.

   Corollary of this is that it makes no sense to rely on a purportedly time-saving services whose revenue mostly comes from advertising.

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn’t.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now
  &lt;em&gt;
   know
  &lt;/em&gt;
  some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can’t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There’s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don’t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn’t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There’s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won’t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you
  &lt;em&gt;
   can
  &lt;/em&gt;
  do, better. Which is what I am doing now.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I meant more books from authors translated into English (so not “Anglo-saxon”). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less satisfying picks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus 7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they were easily exportable and creating them wasn’t such a hassle.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. Bold is  reserved for those I found best:
  &lt;em&gt;
   This House, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Embers, River Town: Two Years on Yangtze, Chimerica, Decline and Fall
  &lt;/em&gt;
  and
  &lt;em&gt;
   The Fall of the Stone City
  &lt;/em&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746"&gt;
    Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Seymour Papert. A book  on constructivist approach to learning written for educators which for me was sometimes a bit of a challenge. Makes a persuasive case for at least a modified approach to learning (wasn’t won over completely) and did provide some intriguing possibilities for my work.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Peking-Murder-Englishwoman-Haunted/dp/0143121006"&gt;
    Midnight in Peking
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Paul French. Similar to
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Suspicions-Mr-Whicher-Murder/dp/0747596484"&gt;
    The Suspicions of Mr. Whitcher
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . A gripping, well researched story about an “unsolved” horrendous murder that vividly brings to life Peking long gone.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Modern-Plays-James-Graham/dp/1472507029"&gt;
     This House
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by James Graham.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   Great and very funny drama about 1974 UK hung parliament that I wish I could see in theater.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X"&gt;
     The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by William H. Whyte.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   I bought this book because I wanted to understand why some places in my neighborhood work so much better than others. The book is easy to read, short, but packed with useful information and I can’t recommend it enough.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Django-Testing-Debugging-Tracey-Karen/dp/1847197566"&gt;
    Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Karen M. Tracey. Book has some flaws: 50$ price on Amazon, sometimes too much details, obsolete Django 1.1. Nevertheless I would recommend it since it does provide a very good and mostly still relevant introduction to this topic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Brother-His-Hakan-Lindquist/dp/3867870853"&gt;
    My Brother and His Brother
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Hakan Lindquist. A warm and sad love story about a boy discovering life and personality of brother he never knew. Recommended.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://django.2scoops.org/"&gt;
    Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Daniel Greenfeld, Audrey Roy. I read this book in alpha and beta form, but can nevertheless heartily recommend it to every Django developer. It gives you something to think about even when you disagree, but you’ll learn plenty too.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Embers-S%C3%A1ndor-M%C3%A1rai/dp/0375707425"&gt;
     Embers
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Sándor Márai.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation (from Hungarian via German).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351"&gt;
    Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Steve McConnell. A must-read book on software estimation for every developer. I just wish it had more to say about challenges of estimation in agile environments.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Uncommon-Reader-A-Novella/dp/0312427646"&gt;
    The Uncommon Reader
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Alan Bennett. A witty book about pleasures and downsides of reading. Good fun for bookworms.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Cups-Deceit-Humanitarian-ebook/dp/B004XHVOW4"&gt;
    Three Cups of Deceit
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Jon Krakauer. Investigative journalism at its best. Look at (mal)practice of Central Asia Institute and its founder. Unlikely to be interesting to those who’ve never heard of it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024514.do"&gt;
    The Accessibility Handbook
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Katie Cunningham. This fairly short book has a few minor errors, but it is packed with information and should be required reading for every web developer.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do"&gt;
    Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by John Myles White. If you do A/B testing, but don’t know what bandit algorithms are, then this short, practical and well-written book will noticeably improve your work.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Town-Two-Years-Yangtze/dp/0060953748/"&gt;
     River Town: Two Years on Yangtze
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Peter Hessler.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   A wonderfully alive and sensitive depiction of life in small China town that might change how you see China. Couldn’t put it down.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Misunderstanding-Irene-Nemirovsky/dp/0099563843/"&gt;
    The Misunderstanding
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Irene Nemirovsky. I completely disagree with the review on Amazon. This would be a very good book even if its author wasn’t 21 when she wrote it. Certainly not sentimental, but also not a overly judgemental look at life of a doomed affair.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   PADI Open Water Diver Manual by . Lots of good information, but poorly organized with bunch of infomercial crap at the back. Still much better than cretinous videos and definitely helps to pass the exam.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radiance-King-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590174550"&gt;
    The Radiance of the King
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Camara Laye. If you have a literal sort of mind, then don’t skip Toni Morisson’s introduction. Beautifully written, still relevant and not completely understood by me.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Criticism-Prickly-Paradigm/dp/0972819630"&gt;
    What Happened to Art Criticism
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by James Elkins. Book that reads like listening to dinner polemic. Still insightful look into why modern art criticism satisfies few, but a bit evasive at times. Did not resolve my problems with modern art.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Porting-Python-3--depth-guide/dp/1456411519/"&gt;
    Porting to Python 3: An in-depth guide
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Lennart Regebro. An encouragingly short book on the topic that still feels complete. Made me want to make my code Python3 compatible.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0156027321"&gt;
    Life of Pi
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Yann Martel. Read it after I accidentally saw the movie which I surprisingly (to me at least) liked  a lot. The book and the movie are really two takes on the same story, both standing on their own, but I liked the movie a bit better. The book is much darker and not for the squeamish.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimerica-Lucy-Kirkwood/dp/1848423209/"&gt;
     Chimerica
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Lucy Kirkwood.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   I bought this book after I’ve seen this remarkable play and it is equally impactful when “just” read. Can’t recommend strongly enough.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Oberon-Modern-Niklas-Radstrom/dp/1840029285/"&gt;
    Monsters
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Niklas Radstrom. Short drama about unfathomable tragedy when children kill a child and the complicity of non-involvement we are guilty of.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926078/"&gt;
     Decline and Fall
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Evelyn Waugh.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   85 years old satire of British society that is sadly relevant and very funny.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/"&gt;
    Testable Javascript
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Mark Ethan Trostler. A book with (I think) slightly incorrect title. I wish ratio between explaining how to test Javascript and how to set up environment was more in favor of the former, but still good book to read on the subject.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Stone-City-Ismail-Kadare/dp/0802120687"&gt;
     The Fall of the Stone City
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Ismail Kadare.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   Complex and rich tale of power, dictatorship and integrity. Just read it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Charlie-Hill/dp/1781251630"&gt;
    Books
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author’s view (which I do).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raising-Steam-Discworld-novel-Novels/dp/0857522272/"&gt;
    Raising Steam
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).
  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really like to build a couple of things I’ve been postponing for years now. Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.
 &lt;/p&gt;
