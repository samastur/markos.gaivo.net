We started even more, but gave up on 3 of them. Life is too short to persevere through movies or books you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I expect to watch fewer films. Not because 100 is impossible to repeat, but I hope visual media will take a smaller slice of our lives. Then again, I’ve just subscribed to &lt;a href="lhttps://mubi.com"&gt;Mubi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I regret seeing them. There were few duds and so many I liked. Clicking on movie titles will reveal my brief impressions of them and I already opened my favourite ones. Selection could easily be different, certainly larger and probably would be if I did it some other day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of 100 movies makes this almost certainly the longest post I’ve written on this website even with (very) brief impressions. Enough words then and here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lady Macbeth (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291600/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I wouldn't start 2021 if I was aware of its source material and wasn't under the wrong impression that it is a kind of Shakespeare adaptation. What at first looks like a story of female empowerment becomes progressively crueler and redeem-less. Florence Pugh is superb though in her breakout role.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;In den Gängen (In the Aisles) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006263618/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A bittersweet look at lives of blue-collar workers in German supermarket. A subtle, moving film.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zimna wojna (Cold War) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6543652/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A beautiful masterpiece from Pawlikowski. It's as close to perfection as films get and deserves multiple viewings.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Bear (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601220/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A split opinion in our household, but I liked it and its surprises even though I also think distressing scenes in last third of a movie could be shorter.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;i'm thinking of ending things (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7939766/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A challenging to decipher, but thought provoking movie beautifully shot by Lukasz Zal with an excellent cast with Jessie Buckley amazing performance.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatie (Diplomacy) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3129564/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;One of the marks of a good movie is that you are on edge even though you know what the end will be. Based on a play so it's a great choice for those of us who enjoy "talking" movies.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undir trénu (Under the Tree) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6223806/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Another movie described as comedy or comic by ill-adjusted critics. It's really a dark drama of neighbour quarrelling with escalating effects on both family. Well made even if the events are fairly predictable.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;Return to Montauk&lt;/del&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5247776/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Failed to meet even our low expectations and gave up on it somewhere in the middle.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;羅生門 (Rashomon) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I wouldn't mind if some of the fights were shorter, but it is otherwise as good as it ever was and highly recommended repeated viewing.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahlat Agaci (The Wild Pear Tree) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6628102/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A Nuri Bilge Ceylan movie. It is probably the most talky drama of his with wonderful performances. Can't recommend enough.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mot naturen (Out of Nature) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3596492/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;An internal monologue of a man on a hike experiencing mid-life crisis.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &amp; Of Itself (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11916302/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A recording of a show made by Derek DelGaudio that is both surprising and thought-provoking examination of identity.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Right Stuff (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Worse than I remembered. Full of male bravado that gets in a way of an interesting story largely unexplored.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uzak (Distant) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346094/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Another movie by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a study of loneliness and frustration from inability to humanly connect. Sad, moving, profound and deserving of every accolade it received.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bab el hadid (Cairo Station) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051390/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A real surprise. The story itself is a bit thin and predictable, but the pay-off is really in characters which includes the station itself and their inherent humanity. Astonishing that it could be made then and not surprising that public in Egypt found it scandalous.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolor y gloria (Pain &amp; Glory) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8291806/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I just love this semi-autobiographical film by Almodóvar about an ageing director facing ill-health and decline of his powers. Tender, witty and beautiful to look at.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Material (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135952/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I can see why Haneke is a fan of Claire Denis. A story about a white coffee farmer and her family in an unnamed African country torn by violent conflict at both delivers what one would expect and still surprise and shock you consistently. A complex, beautifully made movie that is rewarding more than enjoyable.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Serious Man (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1019452/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I forgot I've seen this movie until Déjà vu feeling got too strong. I'm sure I liked it then just as much as I did now which is a lot.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;La stanza del figlio (The Son's Room) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208990/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;My favourite movie by Nanni Moretti that will especially resonate with those of us who have suddenly lost somebody close. A beautifully developed story of a happy family going through a sudden trauma and finding healing from unexpected source.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capitaine Conan (Captain Conan) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115822/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A great movie examining what happens to soldiers once armistice is signed and their honed skills become a liability. Even more so when caught in a limbo of less known part of history when the won WWI was not quite over for many of them yet. Gripping, sad and thought provoking.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;L'avventura (The Adventure) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053619/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A movie I more appreciate than enjoy. Cinematography is spectacular, but the movie held me less after the story leaves the island.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conte d'automne (Autumn Tale) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137439/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Perfectly watchable, but highly overrated. Maybe looks better if you've seen his other seasons movies (I haven't), but although the movie has its delightful moments, the performances and the script just don't click enough for me.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Dinner with Andre (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Odd and engrossing movie that practically requires repeated viewing as two hours of non-stop dialog will keep you preoccupied to really think about many ideas thrown out. Greatly draws from main characters real life and it is difficult if not impossible to tell where real life ends and scripted thoughts begin.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A touching, wonderful film inspired by Truffaut's difficult youth and love of cinema.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hors Satan (Outside Satan) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666168/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;An odd movie with religious motives. Rewarding and thought provoking for few who won't hate it (I didn't).&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unrelated (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt01107850/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A Joanna Hogg movie, a subtly crafted look into civilised unhappiness of well-to-do people. Reminds me of her next movie Archipelago.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3797512/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Occasionally funny surreal comedy that mostly doesn't work for me. It would benefit from being significantly shorter. A disappointment.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palm Springs (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Less surreal than the previous movie and one of the funniest, surprising and surprisingly introspective comedy I've seen this millennium. Just great.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hail the Conquering Hero (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036891/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Still holds really well and the famous restaurant scene is brilliant (and not just that scene). &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le monde est à toi (The world is yours) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6892462/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Forgettable.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;8½ (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A movie that demands a second viewing to fully appreciate, but is pretty great even after first. Every frame really is a painting. I would enjoy it more without the sexism though.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yi Yi (A One and a Two) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244316/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I love this bittersweet drama about one family life's choices and regrets.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073858/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Kafkaesque conflict between Katharina, caught in events, and system that does not care for her. The movie touches on many issues, but is mainly a condemnation of the West Germany press of the time with questions about absolute freedom of press. Worth seeing.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lacombe, Lucien (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071733/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A great unnerving drama of a malcontent opportunistic young man with no convictions and his inevitable fall. At times uneasy to watch, but masterfully and dispassionately told.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wolkenbruchs wunderliche Reise in die Arme einer Schickse (The Awakening of Motti Wolkenbruch) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4766630/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A Swiss romantic comedy about an orthodox jewish youth discovering himself while running away from his mother's meddling.Enjoyed it much more than the lot at IMDB.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Downsizing (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389072/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Different, less intimate, than other recent Payne movies, but I enjoyed it greatly, especially acting by Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au revoir les enfants (Goodbye, children) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092593/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A movie inspired by Malle's childhood memory. Every scene is perfect as it takes you closer to the gut-wrenching ending you hope the story will avoid.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mænd &amp; høns (Men &amp; Chicken) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3877674/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I expect many people dislike this weird movie as much as I enjoyed it. More (darkly) funny than expected and superbly turn of everyone involved.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dawn Wall (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I am the wrong person for these kind of movies as I cannot relate to these kind of achievements. I was moved by the friendship though and fascinated by Tommy's obsession. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Les amants (The Lovers) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052556/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Easy to see why it cause scandal in USA when it was released in 1958, but I appreciated it more than enjoyed. A very compelling way to tell an unpersuasive story.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Un dimanche à la campagne (A Sunday in the Country) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088318/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;An old painter spends a Sunday afternoon with his son's family. A gentle study of a family snf their internal disappointments without much of a plot. Lovely.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King of Comedy (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085794/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;The only thing I really liked in the movie was Jerry Lewis' performance (not a view shared in our household) and I really dislike the ending which we interpreted differently than many critics.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;L'eclisse (The Eclipse) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056736/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;In a way similar movie and experience to L'avventura. Superb cinematography and nicely constructed, but I like it more intellectually than emotionally. The blackface bit would probably get censored today.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;The best Edgar Wright movie, probably because the story was not written by him and thematically matches so well with his style. Even more enjoyable if you grew up or just enjoyed computer games made in 80's and 90's.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;L'avenir (Things to Come) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4120176/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A warm and thoughtful drama about dealing with life disappointments.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mississippi Burning (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095647/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Aged better than most movies from that period and it is still depressingly relevant today. Super performances from the whole cast.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promising Young Woman (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9620292/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I love this movie and it feels undervalued even with mostly positive reviews that often read as searches for a more conventional story. Looking forward to whatever Emerald Fennell creates next. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Y tu mamá también (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245574/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I enjoyed this movie when it came out and like it even more now as I notice and appreciate the multiple layers of Cuarón's story. A coming of age story that is more than just that.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loin des hommes (Far from Men) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2936180/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A north-african western with a Viggo Mortenssen paired well with Reda Kateb based on a story by Camus. Wonderful.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effie Gray (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605798/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Didn't live up to my expectations and I'm starting to have doubts about Dakota's talents.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relatos salvajes (Wild Tales) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3011894/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Crazy sit-at-the-edge-of-your-chair stories. I especially liked "El más fuerte" and "Hasta que la muerte nos separe"&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colette (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11643154/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;90-year-old Colette Marin-Catherine makes her only visit to the German concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora where her brother was killed. Heart-breaking and moving on its own, but what elevates the movie for me even more is the relationship with the young history student.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Watched it again together with my wife. Warm and kind, and I loved it as much as the first time. She on the other hand didn't. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ta'm e guilass (Taste of Cherry) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120265/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A man searching for a person, who would be willing to bury him after he kills himself. A mediation on if the life is worth living. I liked it, but would not hold it against those who didn't.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le boucher (The Butcher) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064106/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Exquisitely portrayed the creepiness of the infatuated butcher and interesting look at french rural life in 70's.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;O Brother, Where Art Thou?  (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;If you don't like this movie, then there's something wrong with you or your current circumstances.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bin-jip (3-Iron) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423866/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Brilliant movie with multiple persuasive interpretations. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl on the Train (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3631112/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Not sure why it was so panned when it was released. It's a perfectly serviceable popcorn movie.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kicking and Screaming (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113537/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Noah Baumbach's first movie. Recognisably his and watchable, but not much more.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Distant Strangers (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13472984/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;An Oscar award winning short movie best summed up by the title of a similar movie: Groundhog Day for a Black Man. I thought it is well done.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;白日焰火 (Black Coal, Thin Ice) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3469910/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Rough around the edges thriller, but not stupid or without atmosphere. Not the worst way to spend a couple of hours.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wetherby (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090310/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Inscrutable. Undecided.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ocean's Eleven (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;There's no depth, but fun throughout and a safe choice to lighten the mood if you're ever down.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Maud (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7557108/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;As I am not a horror fan, I was probably predestined not to be fond of this movie. Ended both intrigued and annoyed.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metropolitan (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100142/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Tom is an unlikeable pompous prick, but while movie (intentionally) doesn't really go anywhere, it does have quite a few amusing exchanges. Liked it.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Squid and the Whale (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367089/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Another Baumbach movie. It's not bad, but personal reasons (unrelated to my family) make it difficult for me to enjoy watching narcissistic self-absorbed parents.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todos lo saben (Everybody knows) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4964788/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Has metascore of 68 which makes it grossly underrated.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;圖雅的婚事 (Tuya's Marriage) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949564/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Tuya is forced to consider divorcing her injured husband to find a new one who could care for borth. Moving, honest without a false note. A must see.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A better movie than I expected from its premise in large part because of excellent casting.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Man (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437405/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Not as bad as Rotten Tomatoes and Metascore say, but not really clicking either.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Stille nach dem Schuss (The Legend of Rita) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234805/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Inge Viett inspired story of idealistic left-wing West German terrorists deflecting to East Germany and living through reunification. My only minor quible with this excellent movie would be its ending, which my wife found fine.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lazzaro felice (Happy as Lazzaro) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6752992/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;The most astonishing part of this story with obvious parallels to Bible is that it was inspired by true events. Exquisite social allegory worth everyone's time.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311113/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Wish this was a start of a successful franchise. Interesting and thrilling to the end.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shiva Baby (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11317142/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Hilarious even when cringey. A blast from beginning to end.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3228774/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Fun and funny prequel to a well-known story with amazing visuals that stops at the right moment to not betray unexpectedly found affection for characters. Hard to see where they'll go from here with the already planned sequel.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le jeu (Nothing to Hide) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7489816/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A remake of Italian Perfect Strangers which I haven't seen. Better than expected and I enjoyed all of it except the ending.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Life of Pets (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2709768/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Hilarious and as enjoyable as we expected. Clearly not a view shared by some humourless people.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il ladro di merendine (Montalbano: The Snack Thief) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199698/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;First part in now decades long series of movies about Sicilian police commissioner. Writing is generally bad, but often surprises with small human interactions that otherwise better, but more economically minded series miss. Fun enough for when you mainly want to kill time without much thinking.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grand Canyon (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101969/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;To riff on somebody's review: "A very much not totally successful movie." Good enough to kill time, but not to seek out.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undergods (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8043434/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Darkly humorous connected stories in dystopian world. Loved it!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;La voce del violino (Montalbano: The Voice of the Violin) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200264/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Another Montalabano movie in very much the same vein. You either like none or all.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;La forma dell'acqua (Montalbano: The Shape of Water) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199536/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;See the previous entry.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;La gita a Tindari (Montalbano: Excursion to Tindari) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275373/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;See the entry before previous one.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tocco d'artista (Montalbano: The Artist Touch) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286229/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;See the entry…forget it. Same as previous Montalbano movies and I obviously liked it enough to keep watching them.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il senso del tatto (Montalbano: The Sense of Touch) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0920489/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;See the previous entry.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Lovers (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1103275/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A well-acted romantic drama with an ending I didn't expect. I liked it.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gli arancini di Montalbano (Montalbano: Montalbano's Croquettes) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338872/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Guess what? A Montalbano movie that I didn't see during a week-long binge as most of the others. Different story, but basically same.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382320/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I stopped watching Bond's mainly because of sexism, but was lured back by Phoebe Waller-Bridge's involvement. Not sorry that I did as it is, for me, the best Bond movie of this millennia if not ever, succeeding with being a Bond movie that only kept the good parts and created a few new as well. No idea how they go from here though.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronicle (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Max Landis is a swine that should be in jail, but he wrote a great superhero-based script dealing with awkwardness of growing up, of inhabiting ones own bodies and learning the impact we have on others. Underrated.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Streams (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087644/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;One of those highly regarded movies where I read a bunch of reviews to see what I have missed. I'm not any wiser. I don't mind meandering movies with a lot of dialogs, but Love Steams feels contrived throughout.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darbareye Elly (About Elly) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360860/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A conceptually similar film to Farhadi's later Todos lo saben. A well observed and acted drama of a group of friends and their responses to a seeming accident. Highly recommended.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprise (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0827517/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;We seeked this one after seeing the trailer for The Worst Person in the World which we couldn't find. Excellent by any standards and especially as the author's first feature length movie.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oslo, 31. august (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1736633/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A melancholic movie about a day outside of rehab spent by recovering addict, superbly played by Anders Danielsen Lie. Another great movie by Joachim Trier.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex, Lies and Videotape (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098724/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;For some reason I remember this movie being heavier than it is. Never boring, delightful and funny.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enemy (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2316411/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;I appreciated it better a day later, once I had time to think it over, but I'm still left being somewhat disappointed, possibly because I don't feel I truly understand its ending scene (or spider theme in general).&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vozvrashchenie (The Return) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376968/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A superb story of two brothers going on a mysterious fishing trip with menacing father who returned after a long unexplained absence. Beautifully filmed and told. A must see movie for every film fan.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;Brelan d'as&lt;/del&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154255/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Abandoned during ludicrously bad second story. Netflix should refund our time for this one.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;Synonymes (Synonyms)&lt;/del&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016254/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Couldn't connect to this at all. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zodiac (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371739/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Fun even in second viewing and when knowing the result of the hunt for the serial killer. Fincher is a masterful filmmaker.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;Even assuming bad acting is there purposefully it is not a great movie. Full of Cronenberg's afectations asks a question of how will games impact our perception of reality in a way that was as unconvincing and contrived when it came out as it is today.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details open&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;La dolce vita (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053779/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Remains timeless classic.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;ドライブ・マイ・カー (Drive My Car) (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14039582/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;A masterpiece.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raising Arizona (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093822/"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;This is a Coen house so of course we liked this one too. It has aged well, but I suspect a joke in it might be risky these days.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;I expected a lighter movie and the ending surprised me (so much about the proverbial Chekhov's gun), but I liked it a lot. Would probably still pick a lighter movie to end the year.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing we watched was bad enough to abandon, although we probably should one or two. As usual I bolded those I think stand above the rest and I think either shouldn’t be missed or are very closed to that grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345525/"&gt;Donald Glover: Weirdo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Alright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11649104/"&gt;The Pembrokshire Murders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A completely decent addition to the true crime genre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380768/"&gt;Love Life&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1 and 2).&lt;/em&gt; Fun, but the first season would be better if it stuck to its premise and didn't lose nerve in the middle by making the main character's experience less common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9112152/"&gt;Efterforskningen (The Investigation)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Danish series about bringing Kim Wall's murder to justice without every showing him or mentioning his name. I wish this was more common approach as it worked so well here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/"&gt;Us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Less funny and more moving story than I expected of using family's European vacation to try saving a marriage. Acutely observed and regularly funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8129450/"&gt;Breeders&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1 and 2).&lt;/em&gt; Trials and tribulations of parenthood. Freeman and Haggard as always reliably funny and scripts hold up well in both seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5460226/"&gt;Search Party&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3 and 4).&lt;/em&gt; Not for everyone, but the strong acting of main characters and good enough writing keeps me interested in the journey of, at this point, completely unlikeable people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698442/"&gt;Behind Her Eyes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; This show felt like a Showtime production. I was too bothered by the main character and unrealistic portrayals of life in London to enjoy the series and the final twist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9561862/"&gt;Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Anthology with a few great (3 robots) and good pieces (like the Hitler one), but otherwise just feel something imagined by a teenage boy: lots of gore, nudity and sex with women characters reduced to whore or hero. Definitely not watching the next season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4192812/"&gt;Unforgotten&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; Mostly still very good and moving show which would be great without the last 10-15 minutes that overwhelm the main story and really spoiled it for me with just bad writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9569546/"&gt;Halston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Underwhelming overall, but I enjoyed learning more about fashion (as it used to be?). I feel McGregor was mis-casted here, but it's difficult to say how much it was him and how much it was script and direction for making me care little about story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10155688/"&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Not perfect, but still captivating criminal series with Kate Winslet and Jean Smart as standouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11815682/"&gt;Hacks&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Another great performance by Smart in a comedy series deserving of received praise. Hoping for another season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/"&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2 and 3).&lt;/em&gt; I enjoyed both seasons, great story and cast but Jodie Comer is simply astonishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/"&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; Different from previous seasons, but still Fargo. Still hoping for another season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld: I'm Telling You for the Last Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Not without laughs, but another underwhelming (old) show from Seinfeld. At least when judged by his reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; An overrated show about affluent, but with one exception not rich people vacationing in a Hawaii resort. The more I think about the show, the more annoying it gets. I am definitely skipping the rumoured second season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11834150/"&gt;The Chair&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I have enjoyed this comedy set in academia a lot and don't care if academics find it a good portrait of it. It  is funny and entertaining, but I also enjoyed more courageous presentation of modern issues than I usually see in mainstream media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/"&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5).&lt;/em&gt; I was surprised how little did I miss exit of two leading characters. Still fun for fans and I find the main idea of the season (alternative court) thought provoking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9055008/"&gt;Evil&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1 and 2).&lt;/em&gt; Created by Kings duo (The Good Fight...) which was the main reason we started watching. Great cast and fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5540990/"&gt;On the Verge&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Watchable, but I expected more. At its most interesting when observing continental European views clash with American progressive culture, but not enough to want to watch another season (if it ever happened).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8310612/"&gt;The Other Two&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1 and 2).&lt;/em&gt; The premise of looking at a family where only those not seeking fame and glory suddenly gain it, is interesting and often funny, but main two characters started to irritate me and everyone feel too flat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8430356/"&gt;This Way Up&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1 and 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Amazing show dealing with mental health and all the obstacles to own's happiness. Genuinely funny too, which is what I would expect from a show by Aisling Bea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12994356/"&gt;The Cleaner&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; I haven't seen the German original, but this version is very good, especially episodes bookending the series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/"&gt;Shetland&lt;/a&gt; (Season 6).&lt;/em&gt; Season written by someone who knew there will be another one. Ending was a bit weak, but otherwise still enjoyable if you weren't too bothered by daily season changes of amazing landscapes. Filming in COVID times far north is challenging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12851524/"&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely one of the most enjoyable shows of this year. Masterfully done and difficult to think of a way to improve it. Can't wait for the next season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/"&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Even more underrated in the second season, but morally-complex characters that are not merely a vessels for crystallised messages are an uphill battle for the show's success, especially when connotations do not neatly align with popular ideas and tribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12313046/"&gt;Alan Bennett's Talking Heads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Successful adaption of 10 (+2 new) monologues for TV. Bennett's humour and humanism makes even difficult parts bearable and monologues as whole enjoyable and acting Is impeccable.&lt;/li&gt;

I read exactly as few books as in 2020 and even though I had only two reading goals for 2021, I managed to fail both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read one fiction book and it wasn’t a great match. Enough people I like with more clout recommend Niven’s book that there’s little harm in me not joining. If we are friends, then it’s probably not for you either (but I could be wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three I read for work and I would recommend each of them highly to those interested in their topics. That is especially true for &lt;em&gt;Inclusive Components&lt;/em&gt; which would get its own post if I trusted myself to find time writing it. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; web frontend engineer should read and think about it, but I would also recommend it to everyone who works with them or needs to consider web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kill-Your-Friends-John-Niven/dp/0061690619/"&gt;Kill Your Friends&lt;/a&gt; by John Niven. Rare books can stand the test of time and current personal mood. This is not such book, but I suspect I would enjoy it and its humour more if I read it when it came out. Last two years especially did not cultivate in me an appetite for despicable psychopaths without any redeeming qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-dp-1491973897/dp/1491973897/"&gt;The Manager's Path&lt;/a&gt; by Camille Fournier. A concise introduction to engineering management ladder, from tech lead to CTO with lots of helpful advice for each role. A useful read both for those who want to learn about expectations of each role when considering their career choices as those who already perform them and might need some friendly advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://book.inclusive-components.design/"&gt;Inclusive Components &lt;/a&gt; by Heydon Pickering&lt;/strong&gt;. I bought a printed version of this book because I expected it to have a lasting value and it does. Some small bits have been obsoleted, there are parts I disagree with and I find the chapter about tables weak compared to others, but it's a fantastic book, a goldmine of insights, techniques and genuinely thought provoking ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884"&gt;High Output Management&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew S. Grove. When reading early chapters I didn't understand why it is so highly regarded, but I changed my mind before half way through. It reads as a textbook from a practitioner, building on concepts and ideas from earlier chapters, focusing on building a mental framework to use instead of tips for specific problems. Still relevant after decades in "print".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances and reasons that led to my abysmal reading record of last two years have not really changed, but my outlook has. I feel more thirsty for reading than I’ve felt in a long time and double digit number of books read does not feel unachievable. Of course, aiming for a healthy split between fiction and non-fiction. The list itself is hazy, but I want to read one of the earlier Pratchett’s and god willing, I’ll try not to read any books on management.&lt;/p&gt;

It wouldn’t surprise me if we watched even more TV than last year, but it turns out we didn’t. We saw more movies though. I’m slowly getting comfortable with not seeing the whole film in one seating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows and movies I liked most are marked in bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7875794/"&gt;Wisting&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; First 4 parts were interesting enough. I thought it was interesting to observe a team trying to catch a serial killer where none of the officers is competent and professional. 5th part was unwatchably absurd and I gave up on the series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9100822/"&gt;The Valhalla Murders&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Better take than Wisting on what tenacious mediocre police can resolve. Perfectly watchable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/"&gt;The Leftovers&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-3).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to say much about it without spoilers, but it is thought-provoking, moving and absolutely must-see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8089592/"&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Series made after the well-known book that takes a lot of liberties with it, uniformly for the worse. Read the book, it won’t take longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228230/"&gt;Quiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A fun and overall well made 3-part series about the 2001 cheating scandal on the quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10234362/"&gt;Avenue 5&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; As usual Iannucci's takes a bunch of obnoxious people, throws them in a high pressure screwup and see what happens. As a fan of his work I'm biased to liking it and I did, but wonder if some of the references and occasionally jokes tempo weren't too demanding for most. Looking forward to the next season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8064302/"&gt;Dead to Me&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; The second season of comedy drama of dealing with consequences of unintentionally inflicted loss. Skip if you didn't like the first season, which I obviously did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4370596/"&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Fourth season of family life of a working actor in LA is even better than previous one. Absolutely loved it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/"&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; Because of Coronavirus shortened season that suffers greatly for it with unexpected and unsatisfying "end". Best to avoid until missing 3 episodes are produced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9244556/"&gt;Mrs. America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Revelatory and entertaining, but expected better and would be without invented Alice Macray and toned down conflicts within movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10332256/"&gt;Hannah Gadsby: Douglas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Nanette was a tough act to follow, but Douglas is great. Original, funny and provoking in the best sense. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7631146/"&gt;The Split&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; I'm a fan of Abi Morgan's work and liked the first season well enough, but am really disappointed with the second one. Absurd with almost no character making sense and seemingly overarching idea that having a child is a wonderful idea no matter how self-destructive a person is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4378376/"&gt;Babylon Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; As good as always with rarely visible historical slips, but with a weak last episode. Wish it ended after 11th. Even bleaker season than previous, ending with a crash of '29. Wonder if season 4 might not become too hopeless to enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276618/"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; Third season is an adaptation of the fourth book in Cormoran Strike series by Robert Galbraith (JK). Old-fashioned crime fiction well written and even better casted. At this point I can't imagine anyone else in leading roles. Fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9348692/"&gt;Criminal: United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Second season, this time with 4 well written episodes (3rd being the weakest). Enjoyed it greatly and I hope there's another season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2077823/"&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A well produced new series showing how Perry Mason became famous defence attorney. Full of surprises especially for those familiar with Perry's character and thoroughly enjoyable. Hopefully this was only the first season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10485750/"&gt;The Pale Horse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Sarah Phelps' Agatha Christie adaptation that was both better than I expected and worse than I hoped. Was fine with most of it, but not keen on its finale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/"&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5-6).&lt;/em&gt; WTH? Was writers room fired? An excellent satire with surprisingly good grasp of technology and silicon valley forgot all that and became a tiresome drama with ever more awful characters in absurdly unrealistic situations. Occasional joke is drowned in long litanies of techno buzzword drivel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8005338/"&gt;Chris Rock: Tamborine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Expected much more from all the recommendations I've seen. Some poignant and attentive parts almost make up for too many cringey bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4604612/"&gt;The Alienist&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-2).&lt;/em&gt; It took me a while to figure out what bothers me about this mostly watchable crime series happening in New York at the end of the 19th century. It feels unpolished in ways early theatre rehearsals can, clunky sentences, good actors not quite clicking, scene setups often too obvious, but Rosy McEwen in the second season is absolutely fantastic. I won't watch the next season, if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9359220/"&gt;Young Wallander&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Watched because of my affinity with the main character from previous outings. Found the end especially unsatisfying. There will be another season, but I won't be watching that either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; The fourth season of the series is very much like the previous ones, just with characters generally becoming less likeable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I'd like it much more if I skipped the just miserable 7th part and could share creator's fascination with crooked horizons. I am not as impressed with it as many, but it's interesting well made drama about part of history I don't know well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8134470/"&gt;The Undoing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I liked the first 5 episodes even with annoying tilt-shift and blur-everything photography, but the last episode really was disappointing with ending both predictable and unconvincing. &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER&lt;/strong&gt;: The setup touches on many interesting potential topics, but the show isn't really interested in any of them beyond providing some uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10846250/"&gt;Roadkill&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; I liked David Hare's earlier works, but was disappointed by his more recent work. Roadkill is the latest series written by him and I enjoyed it greatly. There are a few problematic scenes sacrificing persuasiveness for dramatic purposes, but overall it is well written and performed political drama about a rise of a very faulty popular politician with an ending leaving the door open for another season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12588432/"&gt;Jack Whitehall: I'm only joking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Whitehall can be really funny and has excellent comedic reflexes, but this special was in large parts lazy and stale. Practically the only amusing parts where when target of jokes was Jack himself or his family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/"&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/a&gt; (Season 6-7).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Just as funny and warm as always. Remains one of my favourite shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12117854/"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to Kill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Seinfeld doing his shtick. Not good, probably not even for fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5457520/"&gt;Patton Oswalt: Annihilation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7026230/"&gt;Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12146952/"&gt;Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 3 specials by Oswalt of which I liked Annihilation the most. Seeing out of order the ones predating the family tragedy and the one right after made it somewhat odd and interesting. Was surprised to see a joke repeated, but while they are not particularly thought provoking, they were entertaining enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7653254/"&gt;Marriage Story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Baumbach's compassionate look at marriage breaking up, certainly inspired by his own experience. I was reminded of Irréversible, which although a very different film also has one of the most authentic presentations of love inside of a tragic story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998/"&gt;Game Night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Game Night is exactly what one can hope it would be. A light comedy that is actually funny, but will not be your favourite movie that you re-watch annually. Still better than most modern movie-length comedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8404614/"&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Latest movie by Fernando Meirelles. Not one of his best, but perfectly fine with very good performances of Hopkins and especially Price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/"&gt;The Irishman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I am not sure why this movie was made. It was fine and is well made if long, but felt flat and mostly like I've seen better versions before. However, while acting is generally fine, Joe Pesci is just brilliant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110963/"&gt;La reine Margot (Queen Margot)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I missed it 25 years ago when it was very warmly received. Like previous one it is another film that I liked, but not as much as most. Depiction of the massacre of Huguenots is as shockingly (and realistic) today as it had to be when the film was first released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/"&gt;Gisaengchung (Parasite)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Just brilliant drama in pretty much every way. A gripping socially conscious story that never feels didactic, shot beautifully, that leaves  you ruminating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5649144/"&gt;The Florida Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A series of anecdotes that do not provide more insight or generate more mood than a much shorter movie could. Otherwise fine, but I expected more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/"&gt;1917&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Good, but not as good as I expected, mostly because of its script. Too predictable, almost offensive characterisations and possibly because of that resulting in a film not as engaging as it could be even though it is amazingly shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6053948/"&gt;La enfermedad del domingo (Sunday's Illness)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Sad, but beautifully made moving story about a broken relationship between mother and daughter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6155172/"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A sublime movie worthy of every accolade it received. Rich in details and textures that almost demands multiple viewings. Perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7374948/"&gt;Always Be My Maybe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; By chance watched on Valentine's and it's a perfect movie for the occasion. Has some clunky parts, but often funny and enjoyable overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/"&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Imaginative, provocative depending on your view of inter-species relationships, love story by Guillermo del Toro. I liked it, but it is not a must-see experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052311/"&gt;Touch of Evil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A movie every cinema buff should see even though it is overrated. Its script and Heston's performance as Mexican cop are just terrible, but Welles is good and cinematically, especially the famous opening scene, is among the best. I saw the version edited according to Orson Welles' wishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067328/"&gt;The Last Picture Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another movie which I found less good as its reputation. Alright depiction of boredom and life in atrophying Texas town focused on characters and not reasons for the town's regression. Some fine performances from supporting cast, but female characters are clearly written as what (many) men imagine women to be like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5715874/"&gt;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Missed this Lanthimos movie when it came out. Dark and unsettling, leading to an almost inevitable absurdist and brutal ending. Not for those who dislike author's other movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/"&gt;Uncut Gems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A kinetic and anxiety inducing crime drama about a gambler jeweller trying to strike rich. An exercise in style which covers pedestrian story and overall experience, I suspect, hanging on viewers investment in Howard Ratner which for me was none. Very overrated movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5096470/"&gt;Love Wedding Repeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Sam Claflin plays Hugh Grant playing one of his romantic comedy roles. Trailer is better and movie could definitely be better, but I found it funny enough (view not shared by my wife)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10199914/"&gt;The Boys in The Band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It feels less impactful than it probably was when the play was first performed and practically everyone in the movie is about 10 years too old (could be easily fixed by script change, but wasn't). Still, I'm a sucker for play-like movies and would enjoy this one more if Jim Parsons was a better actor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203620/"&gt;The Dinner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I liked this movie much better than general public and critics, some of whom clearly did not pay attention. Was everything I expected from the original book's sleeve covers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436331/"&gt;Friends with Money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The kind of movie Hollywood stopped making, a movie with a modest budget looking at lives of average people (in this case well-off LA) where not too much happens and nothing is resolved by the end of it. Not to everyone's liking, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090570/"&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A bittersweet true story movie about a decades lasting long distance friendship between book-buying New York based writer and London's bookseller. Like with Friends with Money nothing really dramatic happens, so might be boring to some, but not to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107507/"&gt;Manhattan Murder Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A Woody Allen comedy "thriller" that I think is under-appreciated even with mostly positive reviews, especially Carlo Di Palma's contribution as its cinematographer. Films are a visual medium and cinematography can be used for so much more than setting the mood and the scenery. The jokes are funny and movie is probably enjoyable for most who are not too repelled by Allen these days, but I especially enjoyed the obvious homage to The Lady from Shanghai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9606374/"&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Vastly overrated pure disappointment from Sofia Coppola. I otherwise like (work of) everyone involved in this movie, but this movie is just bad. Clunky script with awful lines, often delivered unpersuasively and without much to say or show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10796286/"&gt;Dorogie tovarishchi (Dear Comrades)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I've seen it online as part of the Liffe festival. A really well made historical drama about to me previously unknown Novocherkassk massacre. Wouldn't mind seeing it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10288566/"&gt;Druk (Another Round)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another movie from Lifffe, this one tackling the question of consequences of excessive alcohol drinking and if they can be positive. Muddled like director's view of the topic. It was fine and I don't regret seeing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086960/"&gt;Beverly Hills Cop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It's more than a quarter of century since I last seen this movie and I was wondering how it would hold up. Still fun and funny and not too dinted by age as so many are from 80's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6359956/"&gt;A Bad Moms Christmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; We watched it because we were too tired to risk something more promising. Has a bunch of actors I like and Susan Sarandon, but was still just awful. Morals of these festive movies tend to be regressive in general, but this one was even more annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10808832/"&gt;Let Them All Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; An unconventional movie with Soderbergh’s outline guiding actors improvisations. Works better than one would expect and I enjoyed the result, but would surely rate it lower if I didn't know how it was made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10618286/"&gt;Mank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Almost a masterpiece that falls short mainly by its sexist portrayal of women that cannot be excused with movie being an obvious homage to films from the era it portrays. Too bad, but otherwise very much worth seeing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6412452/"&gt;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 6 short western stories written and directed by Coen brothers, ranging in tone from dark humour to pure bleakness, but always engrossing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6439020/"&gt;The Personal History of David Copperfield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A series would work better. The pace is too fast to really respond to depicted events and Copperfield comes across meaner than he would otherwise. Colour-blind cast is great and movie is fun, but I expected more from reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/"&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Edgar Wright frustrates me. His talent and meticulous work in creating truly cinematic pulp movies is often wasted on predictable (genre) clichés. Reminds me of Spielberg who keeps ruining his movies with his sentimentality. Still enjoyable ride for pulp or genre fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/"&gt;Beoning (Burning)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One of rare films where my understanding and appreciation grew with time after its end. I still think some digressions don't add much to the movie which could be shorter, but it is overall still a great film well worth watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I read obsessively, but once 2020 happened it was dominated by COVID-19 related research and information. Somewhere in late February or early March I also made a conscious decision to effectively ignore books this year and focus my attention on activities with less individual positive mental health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the books I did manage to read is bad so they all point to Amazon’s smile (well, except the content strategy one). As charity benefits are minuscule I should find a good source not owned by Amazon. Hopefully next year. I recommend those in bold and especially Muriel Spark’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Ayoade-Top-Richard/dp/0571339131/"&gt;Ayoade On Top&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Ayoade. A book about a movie only Ayoade, me and a handful other people saw. An argument for movie's greatness that is a fun reading for fans of Ayoade and his humour and probably not much fun for others. I enjoyed it greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Girls-Slender-Means-Directions-Classic/dp/081121379X/"&gt;The Girls of Slender Means&lt;/a&gt; by Muriel Spark&lt;/strong&gt;. I was drawn to this book by its title and sold on it by its brilliant first page. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am by this relatively short, but immensely rich book exemplified by its comic and with multiple meanings layered title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy"&gt;The Elements of Content Strategy&lt;/a&gt; by Erin Kissane. I read this book first in 2011 and it is still a good overview/reference on this topic. However I was clearly wrong about not having this problem ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Natives-Class-Empire-Sunday-Bestseller/dp/1473661234/"&gt;Natives&lt;/a&gt; by Akala&lt;/strong&gt;. An eye-opening part autobiography, part polemic on racism experienced as a not-white person growing up and living in contemporary UK. A difficult but necessary read even for those of us who are neither British nor living in UK. I don't share authors view on everything (Castro, China...), but would nevertheless recommend this book to anyone who cares about (racial) justice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure I never read fewer books in a year since I learned how to read. 2021 is not shaping up to be a great year either, so my plans will remain modest. Hopefully at least high single digits and evenly split between work and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

I started this one on the same day in January that I published &lt;a href="https://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2018-review.html"&gt;the last one&lt;/a&gt; and here we are in February. Plan for the next one: do it at the end of 2020 or when 2021 is still young enough to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways 2019 felt like a remake of 2018. By any objective measure, as a whole, it was not a good year and 2020 already has in store for us something I don’t look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which does not mean that last year was a never-ending stream of misery. We’ve been to &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157710919477443"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; in summer and went on a bunch of short trips over the year, each of which was fun with a minor exception of a scuffle with a French border guard in Paris. We hiked a lot and I spent on average more than an hour a day being physically active. If only I also ate healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of food, at some point things got out of hand and I now posses almost a double digit number of various powders for chocolate beverages with a creeping number of chocolate/nuts spreads. Maybe the solution is just to put an acceptable label on this, harmless when tempered, development. A collector? A connoisseur? Cocoa aficionado? Can’t say I like any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended last year feeling rather fine, largely thanks to my new job and colleagues at &lt;a href="https://uptree.co/"&gt;Uptree&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t felt so much enthusiasm for my work in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built nothing last year and don’t &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to this year either, at least outside of work, but hope springs eternal. However, it was the first year in a while in which I felt growing. Obviously not physically, although my feet may differ. I attribute this impression to the selection of books I read, life giving me more to chew on and not being too busy for a good part of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth could have been a mirage, but I’ve been pondering a lot and it became really clear that a lot of my thinking last few years was me circling around 3 questions: What do I want to do? What do I want to achieve? And who do I want to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at yearly reviews it is obvious that it was really the tension between the last two that needed resolving. Each of these questions in itself is neutral, but my perception of them isn’t. There’s an introspective quality and aim to “who to be” that I find lacking in “what to achieve”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I find it difficult to write about how these two questions relate to me without sounding like a pompous wanker, but what I would say, if I had another month (a month!), distilled, is that “who I am” has meaningful answers only when it describes relationships and those, human or otherwise, are feeling more precious and impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What to do,” is neither an independent actor nor a servile servant to the other two questions. Once goals are chosen, paths to them may be different, but direction isn’t. Doing still requires making choices and last year certainly showed that I suck at choosing when I give too much weight to money. This is a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not write much here last year, but more than I did before. It would be nice if I would write more, but my real goal is to keep gloominess limited to these yearly reviews. I don’t feel as despondent as my description sounds. If I have to pick what’s true, I’ll go with bad writing over denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make this long post at least a bit shorter, my plans for 2020… support loved ones, do good work, stay active, see world, eat healthy, keep reading, write more, keep learning, surprise myself and ease off sweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this seems like a good time to have a nice cup of hot chocolate…&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2019"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>The books I read in 2019</title><link href="https://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-02T23:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-02T23:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2020-01-02:/articles/books-i-read-in-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last catalog post in the series of what occupied me last year, but this one has a lineage.

I’ve been writing about the books I read annualy since 2009. I was young back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links still lead to Smile Amazon. Those without them are not terrible (like previous years), just without an entry there and I was too lazy and tired from hiking to find a different link. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them. I recommend those in bold. Those wanting to improve their focus may want to check &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/"&gt;Securing Angular Applications&lt;/a&gt; by Ryan Chenkie. While it covers all important bits it is too full of unrelated fluff and could be edited to a quarter of its length. Best for those new to Angular and web development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Evolution-Intelligent/dp/0008226296/"&gt;Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Godfrey-Smith.&lt;/strong&gt; I love this book, but not everyone does. A fascinating look at development of intelligence and cephalopods for those interested in both and I was not bothered too much that author occasionally wanders a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security and Frontend Performance: Breaking the Conundrum by Sonia Burney &amp;amp; Sabrina Burney. A short focused book on improving website's security and performance mainly through better use of HTTP, improving delivery of 3rd party content and use of service workers. A bit aged after 2 years, but still provides a good overview for those using 3rd party resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Chess-Story-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171691/"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; by Stefan Zweig. A novella about chess, human need for stimulus and psychological torture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schachnovelle by Stefan Zweig. Same as previous one, except without minor translation errors. Figured out I could read it in original German and liked it enough to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Arab-Future-Childhood-1985-1987-Graphic/dp/1473638283/"&gt;The Arab of the Future 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf. Third part of trilogy that will have at least 4 parts. Highly recommended for those who liked first two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/My-Sister-Serial-Killer-Novel/dp/0385544235"&gt;My Sister, the Serial Killer&lt;/a&gt; by Oyinkan Braithwaite. A crime novel by a Nigerian author about two sisters, one of which with a penchant for dead now ex-boyfriends. Not my usual fare, but I enjoyed this quick-to-read book a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng/dp/0735224293"&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; by Celeste Ng. Recommended by Tomaž. I was not bothered by it being somewhat predictable, as I don't think author generally tried to or needed to surprise reader, but I think the book would be better if author didn't use future to somewhat sentimentally resolve some narrative threads. Otherwise well written engrossing story with rare off note and I really enjoy reading it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Train-Time-Essential-Heinrich-Boll/dp/1935554328/"&gt;The Train Was on Time&lt;/a&gt; by Heinrich Böll.&lt;/strong&gt; A German soldier boarding a train to the front in Poland has a premonition of his impending death (train ride not incidentally following route of millions of European Jews). A meditative mostly first-person account on war, life, loss and historical disgrace. The kind of book that changes you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692"&gt;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport. I'm ambivalent about this book since I am definitely in its target market, think it has some solid advice and writing itself isn't bad. However, I also mind that much of it is poorly sourced or supported, some clearly coloured by author's prejudices (matching mine) and all of it too closely shaped as self-help genre these days demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Springtime-Broken-Mirror-Mario-Benedetti/dp/1620974908/"&gt;Springtime in a Broken Mirror&lt;/a&gt; by Mario Benedetti.&lt;/strong&gt; A book about a political prisoner in Uruguay and his family in exile written by Benedetti when he was, too, in exile. Wise, witty, moving, profound book is certainly one of the best I read in the last decade and deserves to be read slowly and more than once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Beautiful-Summer-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241983398/"&gt;The Beautiful Summer&lt;/a&gt; by Cesare Pavese. A short novel about a girl’s loss of innocence in 1930’s Turin. Another take on a familiar story which is neither good enough to recommend nor mediocre enough to complain. Translations occasionally felt dated and to me difficult to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Functional-Steps-Transforming-Programmer-dp-1449368174/dp/1449368174/"&gt;Becoming Functional&lt;/a&gt; by Joshua Backfield. “...in Java move to Scala.” OK, but with annoying boss examples and cumbersome language pick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Failure-Memoir-Gary-Shteyngart/dp/0812982495/"&gt;The Little Failure&lt;/a&gt; by Gary Steyngart. Generally not a fan of autobiographies, but I read this one because I like his writing and do not regret it. It is not only a seemingly very honest assessment of his life, family and relationships so far, but it also provides an interesting view in being Russian Jewish immigrant in USA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Functional-Thinking-Paradigm-Over-Syntax-dp-1449365515/dp/1449365515/"&gt;Functional Thinking&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Ford. Similar to Becoming Functional with more emphasis on how to think “functionally” then what functional programming is. Also very focused on Java developers and diluted by involving too many alternatives and not enough focus. Still, better than Becoming Functional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional Programming in Python by David Mertz. A short introduction to functional programming with Python3. Liked it better than the other 2 as it felt more on point. Again wished it touched also on architecture parts of development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Node-Front-End-Developers-Server-Side-Applications-ebook/dp/B0073U0XFM/"&gt;Node for Front-End Developers&lt;/a&gt; by Garann Means. Read to kill time on a flight since it is already very old (2012). Basic enough for examples to mostly still work, but not sure who the audience is. Useful information could be condensed to quarter of its already meagre size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Burial-Rites-Hannah-Kent/dp/0316243922/"&gt;Burial Rites&lt;/a&gt; by Hannah Kent. A dramatised story about last woman to be executed in Iceland, picked while we were there. I got progressively more interested and by the end could hardly put down this well written story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Levels-Julian-Barnes-3-Apr-2014-Paperback/dp/B011T7HJZQ/"&gt;Levels of Life&lt;/a&gt; by Julian Barnes.&lt;/strong&gt; A book about finding and losing love, especially tragically by the author. Or as Independent put it better: "Anyone who has loved and lost can't fail to be moved by this devastating book."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008211213"&gt;Running Blind&lt;/a&gt; by Desmond Bagley. I rarely read crime novels, but I enjoyed this one visiting so many Icelandic tourist spots. Written well enough and certainly surprising enough to keep my attention until its end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cat-Man-Two-Women-ebook/dp/B075V3VP46/"&gt;A Cat, a Man, and Two Women&lt;/a&gt; by Junichiro Tanizaki. A novella about a love triangle with a true feline rival. Enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Little-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241357454/"&gt;The Lady and the Little Fox Fur&lt;/a&gt; by Violette Leduc.&lt;/strong&gt; Almost poetic and most truthful description of poverty and loneliness which demands to be read slowly as every sentence is rich with meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect 2020 to be busy so I’ll be happy if I manage to read as much as passed year. I hope to keep my fiction and non-fiction selection varied and keep trying to avoid Anglo-Saxon authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I enjoyed almost everything I read purely for my own pleasure and &lt;a href="https://markos.gaivo.net/articles/on-technical-writing.html"&gt;almost nothing&lt;/a&gt; I read for work. My work-related reading will likely be directed by work circumstances and hopefully less frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m also recording TV and movies I’ve seen and while I’m not sure if there isn’t a whiff of lunacy to the scope of my tracking, it can be useful, especially for multi-seasonal TV content to decide if one should give next season a go when it comes out. I watched a lot of TV and I mean &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. I could despair about time I spent doing it if much of it wasn’t to relieve boredom of indoor exercise, there were better things to do or if I was snobbish about TV watching as such which I am not. However, it does make this post absurdly long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did spend comparatively little time watching movies. Ironically that was because they are longer and it is easier to fit up to an hour long chunks of content into exercise regimen or dying hours of a day. As blasphemous as this is to many directors, maybe I should watch movies in parts next year (except those rare few I still grudgingly see at local cinemas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows and movies I most liked are marked in bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the things that could be watched this year, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9573980/"&gt;Leaving Neverland&lt;/a&gt; had and will have by far the most profound and doubtlessly lasting impact on me and I didn’t even see it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year there are shows on which I disagree with most critics. This year I was most bothered by gushing over Succession, which is well done but forgettable and poor reception of The Morning Show, which deserves more respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was especially impressed by the first episode of &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;, mini series &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; and all seasons of &lt;em&gt;Rectify&lt;/em&gt;. I think they are all masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8463714/"&gt;The ABC Murders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I was at first skeptical about Malkovich playing Poirot, but he did the excellent script by Sarah Phelps full justice. Her changes to original material were substantial and not for Christie or Poirot purists, but have really elevated the material above a light evening entertainment. It is the only Christie adaptation I remember thinking about days after I saw it and could not recommend it enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8002604/"&gt;Camping&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; An odd and occasionally funny outing of mostly unlikeable characters that really goes off the rails in the last episode and makes you question why you bothered watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7230846/"&gt;No Activity&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A US adaptation of an Australian show about two bored coppers on a stake out where nothing much happens. Uneven, but mostly funny enough for light entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1474684/"&gt;Luther&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5).&lt;/em&gt; Luther was always also silly, but Neil Cross really stopped caring. The best I can say about season 5 is that it wasn't season 4 or Hard Sun and I could ignore nonsensical stuff most of the time. Still, no matter what happens to Luther in the future, this is the last one I'll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8010592/"&gt;Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, American Crime Story&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Did not expect to like or be interested in this one, but it was excellent. Versace's murder is used not only to show what happened to the famous designer, but also to explore and explain what led to it and how difficult it was to be gay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6859806/"&gt;Mrs. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Ruth Wilson plays portrays her grandmother in an extraordinary story about consequences of a marriage to a bigamist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5565334/"&gt;Friends from College&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Not well received second season of a show about a group of friends from college (hence title) of questionable character. Obviously not for everyone, but I liked both seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3526078/"&gt;Schitt's Creek&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A sitcom about a family of suddenly impoverished living in a town they own. Funny enough, but I've been told it gets better in later seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/"&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A young woman keeps dying and reliving her birthday party while trying to figure out what is happening. Could easily be a tropey take on popular reliving a day theme, but is absolutely terrific in so many not always obvious ways. A must see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270492/"&gt;Billions&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; I liked first two seasons even with some reservations, but had to stop watching 3rd after 4 parts. Problems with script and to a lesser extent acting just became unbearable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4374208/"&gt;Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; A decent ending to fantastic series that might not have reached previous heights (for good reasons), but that I enjoyed throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/"&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/a&gt; (Seasons 1-3).&lt;/em&gt; Spinoff of The Good Wife with some improvements, but with the same unappealing female acceptance of male transgressions in first season. Gets better in second and completely absurd by the end of the third. For fans of the original series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5014882/"&gt;The Durrels&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Series made after a popular English book. Could not keep interest after 4th episode of the first season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/"&gt;Shetland&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5).&lt;/em&gt; If you are a fan of competently done crime series, Scotland accent and moody landscape, then this is a show for you. I am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770590/"&gt;Amy Schumer Growing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Comedy special for fans of Amy's humour. Not among best, but I laughed plenty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6599482/"&gt;The Romanoffs&lt;/a&gt; (aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Watched only the first episode of this anthology series. Waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183404/"&gt;Rectify&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-4).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Probably the most realistic take on life and life challenges after surviving death row. Profound, engaging and uninterested in cheap thrills. One of the very best TV series ever made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3561180/"&gt;Ófærð (Trapped)&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; I liked the first series a lot and had great expectations for the second. It was fine at first, but script got more ridiculous as it was coming closer to the end. Still beautiful shots of Iceland's landscape, but not much to recommend otherwise for those not exceptionally gullible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5069564/"&gt;John Mulaney Comback Kid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178650/"&gt;The Victim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A short drama series about aftermath of a horrible event, when a boy murdered a younger boy. Thoughtful, provocative and well acted. Not an easy viewing, but very worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8594510/"&gt;Back To Life&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A dark comedy about rebuilding life after 18 years in prison. Moving, funny and, apart from too long prison sentence, believable. Hope there will be a second season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7820906/"&gt;Good Trouble&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Awful, bloody awful. A rare miss from usually reliable source of recommendations. Ditched in the middle of the second episode because we couldn't stand the stupidity of it all anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8064302/"&gt;Dead to Me&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Liked it better than most critics. Would watch another season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/"&gt;Veep&lt;/a&gt; (Season 7).&lt;/em&gt; Last season of a very funny show that had to work very hard not to become a documentary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9169592/"&gt;Wanda Sykes: Not Normal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Like most comedy specials best for fans of the performer which I am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/"&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A short series about the accident and its aftermath. The best HBO series in years and I cannot recommend it (and its official podcast) enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/"&gt;Good Omens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I love the book so I am ill equipped to judge this series, but book's fans should definitely like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5056196/"&gt;Catch-22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Not so much an adaptation as it was inspired by the book. Probably this series can be alright for those who haven't read the book and should NOT be a substitute for reading it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509004/"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; 9th episode is a small gem, but I otherwise could not warm up to this highly regarded series. Maybe it would leave a better, more ground-breaking impression in 2011, but in 2019 its mostly odious characters really don't need this much time and space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5687612/"&gt;Fleabag&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A great follow-up to the excellent first second with the first episode a spectacular Pinter-like comedy drama deserving to be taught in film school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8694364/"&gt;Years and Years&lt;/a&gt; (aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Unexpectedly horrible to the point where we gave up after 2 episodes. Paper thin characters, speechifying, trying to touch so many issues it becomes a pale ideological satire of present. I have no idea how this can be Russell T. Davies' work and why critics like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687642/"&gt;Simon Amstell: Set Free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/"&gt;Mindhunter&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Drama about development of FBI profiling. Second season is as good as the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/"&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-2).&lt;/em&gt; A comic drama series of Murdoch/Sinclair/Redstone like family. Or as someone described it: HBO Billions. Fine in the first season, but much better in its second. Good, but not as great as described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7909970/"&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A short series based on true events of catching a serial rapist. Excellently executed with respect to everyone involved in original events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8708280/"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A series of 10 minute episodes about a couple with marriage in crisis. Written by Nick Hornby. Opinions about it are divided in our household, but I liked all episodes except last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4370596/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt"&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; Hard to give a good short description of this series that is even more structureless in this 3rd season, but it remains being one of my favourite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9348692/"&gt;Criminal: United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A police procedural anthology series with 3 well written and played episodes, especially first two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10409666/"&gt;Gary Gulman: The Great Depresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another comedy special with Gary talking about his struggles with depression. Worth seeing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3920596/"&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Not great as the first season, but fine. I do wonder what it would look like if they kept Andrea Arnold's vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986056/"&gt;Criminal: Germany&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Second part was bad, but not unwatchable as Criminal: France, the rest of it was very good with two stellar supporting role performances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3747572/"&gt;Grantchester&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; Fourth series of crime drama for fans of sleuthing vicars in post-WWII England. As it ever was, but I've had enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4998350/"&gt;The Deuce&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2-3).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A three season drama about systemic exploitation of women and other marginal groups through prostitution, pornography and government/police indifference and corruption. Not an easy watch, but absolutely worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; New cast, same family. This time with less affection for people involved, but otherwise much like first two seasons. Meaning still a very good TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4322508/"&gt;Les témoins (Witnesses)&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; First series was great and second is like watching a car crash. I couldn't believe the same people were involved in creating a series that is even worse than the abysmal 3rd season of Line of Duty. Why in the world did I not give up sooner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11163014/"&gt;Mike Birbiglia: The New One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I worship in the church of Birbiglia whose every outing makes me want to become a writer. There is no better storyteller among comedians and his most recent show is no exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9644058/"&gt;The Guilt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A fun to watch comedy crime series with unexpected ending that tests those who like moral or just endings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11168100/"&gt;Seth Meyers: Lobby Baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny. I especially liked the part channeling his wife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/"&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Underrated show about TV morning show examining #MeToo revelations and its consequences on all. Less flashy but with more depth than better received Succession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were few real duds this year and a few movies I really liked, but the one that I keep thinking about is &lt;em&gt;Portrait of a lady on fire&lt;/em&gt;. It is rare I see a movie which cannot be moved to a different art form without losing some of its magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075192/"&gt;Manbiki kazoku (Shoplifters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A bittersweet story about a family of misfits trying to survive on margins of Japanese society with help of small crimes and contemplation of what constitutes a family. Not a mood lifter, but one of the best films I've seen in last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/"&gt;The Favourite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Drama often mislabeled as a comedy because of comic bits about life of Queen Anne. Absolutely must see even if you don't care one iota about Anne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6742252/"&gt;Den skyldige (The Guilty)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A Danish thriller about a police dispatcher receiving a distress call with nothing but his phone, wits and police database to go on with to genre befitting twists and turns. Wholly well done and definitely recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6266538/"&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A movie about Dick Cheney's rise to power with an almost distractingly good performance from Christian Bale. Well made and certainly above a typical biography and I enjoyed the movie greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4218572/"&gt;Widows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; More drama than a thriller about a group of robber widows organising a heist. Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn raise the movie above normal genre fare without sacrificing any of the thrills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/"&gt;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Rewatched it after a long time and can still be enjoyable if one can get pass Ferris' obvious psychopathic traits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714886/"&gt;Post Mortem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A movie about a shy Chilean clerk falling in love with his neighbour during 1973 military coup. Good movie, but not an easy watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8169446/"&gt;Wine Country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; An addition to comedy genre of group of friends celebrating birthday on a long weekend trip. Fairly formulaic and mostly for fans of people involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5776858/"&gt;Phantom Thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A well produced and acted character study of broken unpleasant people. It kept my interest for 2 hours, but did not left me with any lingering thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1087890/"&gt;Frygtelig lykkelig (Terribly Happy)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I feel like I've seen this noir thriller before. My wife was disappointed, but I thought it was OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/"&gt;Office Christmas Party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I did not dislike this movie as most seem to even though it can be really ridiculous. Kate McKinnon is a comedic goddess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/"&gt;Booksmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This movie deserves a better trailer. It's a very funny and refreshing take on a known end of high school formula. Certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in recent years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7921248/"&gt;La Gomera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another wife's disappointment and I can see how Gilda's part can be really grating, but I enjoyed it while watching even though its main idea is ridiculous on the first examination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/"&gt;Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a lady on fire)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Cinema at its finest. There's not a tone played wrongly in this love story and I hope to see it again soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6920356/"&gt;The Souvenir&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Movies do not get better reviews than this one and I have no idea why. I liked Hogg's Archipelago and Souvenir is certainly technically well done, but the story is pedestrian and has been better done too many times before and I couldn't find anything else to get out of this movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8800266/"&gt;Ema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I've seen most Larraín's movies and liked all of them except this one. I got confused by focusing on the wrong thing in a crucial scene, but even with that it shows that parts of the movie were done without script as I found characters rambling off-putting. It's still Larraín's movie so not without merit, but I was still overall disappointed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094606/"&gt;The Accidental Tourist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The kind of movie studios don't really make anymore. A story about life after family tragedy, end of marriage and new hope. Worth seeing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These notes …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After I wrote my last annual review of books read in 2018, it occurred to me that it would be helpful (to me) if I also recorded other things I’ve seen or heard. So, I have also started jotting down exhibitions, plays and other events we attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes are probably even less useful to any one not me than those about books, but at least some exhibitions can still be seen at the time of writing (permanent collections and around the last fifth of the list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exhibitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we visit on average about ten exhibitions each year. Various circumstances contributed to us seeing almost thirty this year, which will not happen again any time soon. We were lucky and most exhibitions we saw were at least interesting, many good and a few really amazing or even once-in-a-lifetime events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhibitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/monet/"&gt;Claude Monet&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An excellent exhibition which happily did not focus only on Japanese bridge and water lilies. Probably most painting by Monet you could possibly see at one place outside of Marmottan Monet in Paris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/helen-levitt/"&gt;Helen Levitt&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An interesting exhibition of one of the pioneers of street photography. What I found especially intriguing were strips of negatives that allowed visitors to compare selected and unselected pictures and how those presented were sometimes cropped. I probably am not the only person who would make a few different choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/niko-pirosmani/"&gt;Niko Pirosmani&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; A small exhibition of to me unknown Georgian naïve painter who was an important influence on Chagall and Picasso (among others). While I was not enamoured with all presented painting, others made strong impression on me and I would love to see his paintings again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/105/into-the-great-outdoors"&gt;Into the Great Outdoors&lt;/a&gt; (Leopold Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An exhibition of mostly late 19th century Austrian outdoor painters and paintings. Apart from few exceptions it mostly left me cold and unimpressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/104/klimt-moser-gerstl"&gt;Klimt-Moser-Gerstl&lt;/a&gt; (Leopold Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; I was not familiar with Gerstl who I think would do interesting work if he lived longer. I was also pleasantly surprised by Moser and Klimt part of the exhibition. Unfamiliar works and a new perspective gave me a new appreciation for both artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bruegel2018.at/"&gt;Bruegel&lt;/a&gt; (Kunst Historisches Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; A truly once in a lifetime experience. Seeing 4 out of 5 surviving months of the year paintings next to each other as well as both Towers of Babel were two highlights of a really exceptional presentation of the Flemish master. We could be there for hours more, but with just end of a day tickets available could stay only until we were thrown out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mglc-lj.si/eng/exhibitions_and_events/posters/74"&gt;Milton Glaser, Posters&lt;/a&gt; (MGLC, Ljubljana).&lt;/em&gt; A small exhibition of 35 posters made by Milton Glaser. Wished exhibition was bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/2019-sony-world-photography-awards-exhibition"&gt;Sony World Photography Awards Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (Somerset House, London).&lt;/em&gt; Any awards exhibition will show choices one disagrees with, especially when there are 800. It helps to skip reading often inane descriptions next to them. Still, I overall enjoyed the exhibition and more than I suspect I would the Deutsche Börse one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/diane-arbus-beginning"&gt;Diane Arbus: In The Beginning&lt;/a&gt; (Hayward Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; I am not an admirer of most of her work, but this exhibition really helped me understand her historical importance as so much of modern photography I dislike (and sometimes like) was clearly directly influenced by her work. I feel I'd like it more if my experience wasn't already tainted by her less talented and interesting successors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/don-mccullin"&gt;Don McCullin&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Britain, London).&lt;/em&gt; Having seen so many of his pictures I was still not prepared for this punch in a stomach. Moving, devastating and always humane and needs to be seen even when most uncomfortable. I kept wondering how he managed to survive decades of his work and the answer is he kind of hasn't completely. Echoes of human suffering are still present even in his recent photos of Somerset landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/the-renaissance-nude"&gt;The Renaissance Nude&lt;/a&gt; (Royal Academy of Arts, London).&lt;/em&gt; Wish it was a longer exhibition of development of the nude in 15th and 16th century art. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/cc-land-exhibition-pierre-bonnard-colour-memory"&gt;Pierre Bonnard&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; Some people question if Bonnard was any good. Those people are idiots. His compositions alone, especially those involving people, were innovative, interesting and usually well executed. I care less about his landscapes which are just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dorothea-tanning"&gt;Dorothea Tanning&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; Ashamed to say I did not know her before as her works in  this exhibition blew me away. A feast for the eyes. I find surrealistic art difficult to interpret, but would love to know more about her personal family experiences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/munch.aspx"&gt;Edvard Munch&lt;/a&gt; (British Museum, London).&lt;/em&gt; An exhibition worth seeing on Munch's development as a printmaker with more than 80 prints from Munch and artists that influenced him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://artmuseum.is/exhibitions/johannes-s-kjarval-cant-draw-harebell"&gt;Jóhannes S. Kjarval: Can't Draw a Harebell&lt;/a&gt; (Reykjavik Art Museum, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; Exhibition of "floral" work of one the most important Icelandic painters. Fine, but not the kind of work I enjoy greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.listasafn.is/english/exhibitions/national-treasures"&gt;Treasures of a nation&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery of Iceland, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; An eclectic, often changed, mix of works from various Icelandic artists and the kind of exhibition where everyone can find pieces to enjoy. I certainly did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.listasafn.is/english/exhibitions/hulda-hakon-1-2"&gt;Hulda Hákon: Who are you people?&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery of Iceland, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; A retrospective of to me unknown artist. I am still undecided on artistic merits of her works, but they are certainly engaging and fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gam.comune.verona.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=43329&amp;amp;tt=museo"&gt;Permanent collection&lt;/a&gt; (Galleria d’Arte Moderna Achille Forti , Verona).&lt;/em&gt; Some very nice pieces in a collection of mostly 19th and early 20th century art that was shortened by an underwhelming photo exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=castelvecchio+verona"&gt;Permanent collection&lt;/a&gt; (Museo di Castelvecchio, Verona).&lt;/em&gt; Again, a few very interesting pieces in a collection that requires affinity for sacred art. Worth seeing for the castle and architectural upgrades alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/the-credit-suisse-exhibition-gauguin-portraits"&gt;Gauguin Portraits&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; While knowing a bit about Gauguin's life beforehand I still did not expect that the main take from this exhibition will be what an absolute swine he was. But not talentless which I think is especially obvious in his later works done outside of France. No shortage of good paintings and some great ones, but the ticket price was still exorbitant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/taylor-wessing-photographic-portrait-prize-2019/exhibition/"&gt;The Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize 2019&lt;/a&gt; (National Portrait Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; I thought there were a few very good photo portraits, but overall I found the exhibition disappointing. Most exhibits covered the same few trendy issues in a fairly formulaic way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/expositions/leonardo-da-vinci"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; (Louvre, Paris).&lt;/em&gt; An amazing collection of works that could be presented better (e.g. IR reproductions next to the actual pictures with more guidance). I also missed more contextual information, but it was another must-see once in a lifetime exhibition. Event Vitruvian man showed up with its very own security guard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson"&gt;Olafur Eliasson: In Real Life&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; I was passingly familiar with him before, but now I might have found my favourite contemporary visual artist. A fantastic exhibition of few decades of work clearly inspired by Iceland that was sad, fun, full of wonder and never dull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist"&gt;William Blake&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Britain, London).&lt;/em&gt; I still admire a lot of his works, but this comprehensive look into his whole life and work has also shown Blake could be lazy and mediocre when not interested in work he was hired to do. I wish curators of such exhibitions dared to be more critical, but enormous amount of works, many rarely accessible (such as one of only two existing copies of coloured Jerusalem) presented well, make it a must visit one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year.html"&gt;Wildlife Photographer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; (Natural History Museum, London).&lt;/em&gt; A now annual visit to enjoy recent works and find amusement in often questionable background descriptions. Astonishing how much better wildlife photos got in just the last decade. I never fully agree with judges’ decisions, but there were few if any real misses this year and I'm glad we saw it. Still find it odd that exhibition merchandise is also made out of photos that didn't even qualify for the exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_bermondsey_2019"&gt;Anselm Kiefer Superstrings, Runes, The Norns, Gordian Knot&lt;/a&gt; (White Cube, London).&lt;/em&gt; 80% of modern art is garbage, but Kiefer's certainly isn't. Kiefer is not a happy optimist and exhibited works can be almost literally (physically) overwhelming. They are views into sins past and present, but visually compelling, even beautiful and I could not look away. I liked superstrings series the least, but still a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/albrecht-duerer/"&gt;Albrecht Dürer&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; I was familiar with Dürer's print work and knew Albertina has an amazing collection, but this exhibition was nevertheless a revelation of his talent and skill. He could do pretty much anything and his watercolour paintings are breathtaking. As usual team at Albetina excels at contextualising and explaining his work (unlike say Louvre) and hours just flew by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plays are something I only see in London because we visit it most often. I am rarely really disappointed even though or maybe because UK theatre seems less experimental than our own. Wish I wasn’t so (unreasonably?) annoyed by Slovenian acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, performances we saw this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pinteratthepinter.com/the-plays/betrayal"&gt;Betrayal&lt;/a&gt; by Harold Pinter (Harold Pinter Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; A play about infidelity and its disastrous consequences told in reverse chronological order. Wonderfully acted by all and especially Tom Hiddleston.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/three-sisters/8-apr-2020-25-may-2019"&gt;Three sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Anton Chekhov (Almeida Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; Not as good as &lt;em&gt;Summer and Smoke&lt;/em&gt; was by the same team and difficult to enjoy when you are repeatedly reminded of unpleasant recent events, but nevertheless a good show solidly acted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thepiccadillytheatre.com/death-of-a-salesman"&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/a&gt; by Arthur Miller (The Piccadilly Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; A phenomenal production and performance by Wendell Pierce, Sharon D. Clarke and the rest of the cast with many in audience moved to tears. Felt privileged to see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/translations"&gt;Translations&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Friel (National Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; Irish accent made this more difficult to follow and I would love to read the play, but it was unquestionably a moving and thought-provoking examination of language, communication and cultural imperialism. Splendidly performed by everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.garricktheatre.org/noises-off/"&gt;Noises Off&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Frayn (Garrick Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; I rarely enjoy farces, but this one was hilarious. I haven’t laughed so much in a while. Cleverly structured in 3 parts, each building on previous, is funny almost without a pause and performed without a fault and exceptional timing by a great cast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rarely go to concerts anymore as they are simply too loud and crowded for me to enjoy, but we happened to stumble upon Bach’s St. John Passion performed at St. Martin in the Fields church while we were in London for Easter, which promised to be neither. I always had difficulty understanding sung words in any language, but especially German. Nevertheless, the performance was beautiful and while I wasn't too keen on Stephen Anthony Brown's evangelist take, it was certainly done well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="culture"></category><category term="exhibition"></category><category term="theatre"></category><category term="concert"></category><category term="2019"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>On technical writing</title><link href="https://markos.gaivo.net/articles/on-technical-writing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-03T14:42:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-11-03T14:42:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-11-03:/articles/on-technical-writing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Early this year I was reading a couple of books about Typescript and got really annoyed by basic technical errors and poorly conceived books structures.

Python &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a strongly typed programming language and if the intended reader is expected to already have mastered Typescript’s basics, then they probably don’t need a chapter on how to install it. I wanted to vent about decline in quality of technical books in recent years, but I am glad now that I didn’t get around writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I decided to use some of my downtime during treks to update and improve my knowledge of functional programming by reading 3 books on this topic and I could hear my inner voice screaming, again: “Who is this book for?” Too much effort was spent on technical minutiae and none whatsoever on how to actually design and develop programs of non-trivial length, which in my experience is one of the main stumbling blocks for inexperienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these books was new with the oldest coming out in 2012. All three were published by O’Reilly which at least back then was considered a respected source of technical content. So, quality erosion started sooner than I noticed, but still seems to be getting worse with publishers cutting corners everywhere while trying to compete with self-published authors whose books often seem overstuffed with marginally useful information to fatten them to book length, probably to raise their perceived value so they can become a source of passive income and/or improving author’s resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course some books, self-published or not, are good, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find them between so many bad ones. Especially since number of online reviewers have not scaled nearly as much and hence most books have few if any reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for people like me, who like to learn about a new topic through books, but I think the effects may be larger. Books can be a good way to coalesce and distill knowledge to a package that could serve as a good introduction to topic’s novices. Modern web development has become a complicated affair with surprising and often depressingly short turnaround of technologies used and while it is useful to have someone explain in detail a tool that will likely be largely abandoned in two years time, I find there are not enough of them aiming for longer shelf life by teaching foundational knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring I threw out more than a meter of old, mostly computer-related books that were now completely obsolete and I could certainly do the same with most electronic books that I have, if I could be bothered. While I was doing this, weighing on each book if it still has something valuable to say, a question kept coming up. If I was starting my career today, as many are, how would I even go about it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="technical writing"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry></feed>
