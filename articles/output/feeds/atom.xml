Too much of this semi-fictional genre is snobbishly prescriptive or laughably overconfident (and sometimes both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most annoying example of former is almost a sub-genre of writing describing the right way to travel while scolding “detractors” where right usually means backpacking for months with a small backpack and on cheap trying to meet locals. I find it especially annoying because not only do we not all travel for the same reasons, for most of us how we travel is a compromise between our wishes and abilities including available time and money. What every traveller should strive for is to minimise their negative impact on environment and visited cultures and apart from cruises there are few travel approaches that I would describe as a priori wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other grating notion is the idea that spending a few months in a foreign society will result in your understanding of it. This is not true even if you are an anthropologist. More exposure rarely hurts, but I wish more people stayed humble in their interpretations of observed events. I understand English pretty well, have spent cumulatively almost two years in England, have friends there and have spent decades consuming British culture through media, books, TV, movies and music. An investment I am unlikely to be able to repeat with any culture and yet I am still not completely fluent in it. There are bits I don’t understand and frankly not all British do either as is likewise true for me and Slovenian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I find an interesting advice or insight can salvage almost anything. With this hope, here’s mine. Try watching local TV at least a bit during your travels, especially commercials. I find advertisement provides a skewed, but interesting lens on how society wants to see itself and what it finds important and profitable. Also, asking for opinions instead of facts is more likely to elicit richer answers and repeating previously answered questions to newly met people can be illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Photo) gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I read articles about travel rarely except when doing research, which mostly is looking for information about specific locations and travel gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we’ve developed check lists for all types of trips we do and got pretty good at packing, but the need to tweak our gear never goes away if for no other reason to replace worn out stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few items I am almost obsessed about. Backpacks are one of them. Their designs have immensely improved over the years and I have also accepted that we need several, but I think philosophical differences between me, and backpack designers make it unlikely I will find a perfect one for multi-day treks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trekking trousers are another. Men trousers are usually serviceable, but women’s are generally awful because of creators seemingly almost phobic fear of external pockets. If one needs to wear a jacket or take off their backpack to have access to a map or one’s phone, then they are not fit for use and most aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since we are both keen photographers, I especially try to optimise photo equipment we lug around. Last decade brought a lot of changes to gear I see used on our trips. Most casual shooters have switched to using smartphones and mirrorless cameras are replacing DSLRs among photo enthusiasts although later group may carry as much as it used to since new space and weight are now often taken by drones. Everyone uses whatever device makes desired shot the easiest (e.g.  wide panoramas tend to be taken with smartphones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trips usually include up to a weeklong off grid treks. It took me way too long to figure out that the best way to handle those is carry a high-capacity power bank and making sure every electrical device can be powered through USB connection. This makes everything easier also when we are back as it reduces number of cables, is generally easier to fix if something goes wrong and reduces the need to find free electrical sockets. We don’t use solar cells because they would rarely if ever be practical to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last trip I tried to see how well I can do with smartphone as my only camera. Generally, I was pleased with &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157673205196187"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157703189184404"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; but found phone’s lack of zoom too limiting. Which is why I have switched to iPhone X with its 2x optical zoom. Still, while better than before this is often not enough and cannot be compensated with cropping because significant crop of a 12M image does not leave many pixels even when change of perspective is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems new phones will add even wider lenses that are fairly useless to me as stitched panoramas are excellent and have better resolutions. I have experimented with switchable lenses from &lt;a href="https://shiftcam.com/"&gt;ShiftCam&lt;/a&gt;. I still love their design, but lenses themselves are of poor quality, a problem also plaguing their competitors based on published online images. Would gladly pay more for an easy to use quality zoom lens if I could find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, apps available for tweaking photos are often phenomenal. As an iOS user I mostly rely on built-in tools, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/skrwt/id834248867"&gt;SKRWT&lt;/a&gt; for perspective corrections and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/touchretouch/id373311252"&gt;TouchRetouch&lt;/a&gt; for removing unwanted items. It can feel almost magical how easy it can be to shape up a photo. I am sure equivalent tools exist also on Android platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the technical quality of these photos is still noticeably worse than those taken by our Nikon so we will continue carrying all that stuff. If only I could now find a compact travel tripod that would be easier to attach to our backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category><category term="gear"></category><category term="photo"></category><category term="photography"></category><category term="phones"></category></entry><entry><title>Securing web applications</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/securing-web-applications.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-14T18:01:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-05-14T18:01:00+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-05-14:/articles/securing-web-applications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently finished working on a project with stricter security requirements than I am used to.

While my work on the project is done and I am deciding on what to do next, I keep thinking about what I did and what I could do better next time beyond following established good implementation practices. This is my attempt to jot down my (unpolished) thinking, which will be light on technical details as I am not allowed to divulge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I did was to create &lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Threat_Modeling"&gt;a threat model&lt;/a&gt; for the app’s frontend. It is not something I would see done on every project, but it really should be a standard practice even if it is simplified to a “living” list of assets to protect, identified threats and planned countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An under-appreciated part of web frontend development using client-side frameworks is that practically speaking, it is not possible to secure the app you are building on your own. Every major framework depends on and installs hundreds of packages (usually more than a thousand) and it is not feasible to audit all of them and their updates. Even a smaller problem of tracking license compliance is a nightmare. Therefore, managing risk also involves managing trust in external parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using such frameworks is beneficial enough, I favour libraries built &lt;strong&gt;and in use&lt;/strong&gt; by major tech companies such as Google and Facebook, especially if their documentation does not ignore security. They may not be better in all aspects I might care about but will have both more resources invested in their development and more likely to be properly audited as those companies present a much bigger and valuable target than companies I work with. I avoid adding 3rd party libraries as much as economically possible and when not, prefer to copy parts actually used (with license and reference to original) when only small bit of that library is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading 3rd party code directly in browser should be frowned upon. Even with modern toolbox for avoiding/limiting abuse (&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"&gt;iframe sandboxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"&gt;CSP&lt;/a&gt;…) nothing is remotely as safe as not loading unknown resources in the first place. Since this is not always possible or desirable it is best to treat them as an existing exploit of unknown severity and decide where they must be avoided and how to best manage their risk elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar risk is posed by browser extensions. User fingerprinting is a very good reason for trying to prevent discovery of loaded extensions, but I would still find it useful to at least know if there is &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; extension loaded that has access to my app’s contents without explicit user request.  It seems this is not possible. Admittedly this is not a wide-spread desire and most applications would not change their behaviour based on this information, but few should (e.g. banking web apps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler, more naïve times we used to discuss if DOM is a good place to store state of a page. Clearly this is not a good idea for anything beyond storing state of UI controls and even then, every change should be reflected on screen with an appropriate user notification (change transition, alert…). I remain undecided on how much uni-directional data flow helps with security, but it does some, similarly to how private class properties do and I find it easier to track possible attack points, if interface is a rendered reflection of application’s state and I can focus my attention on interactive parts with which user changes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting code and data from nosy scripts with Javascript closures is already effectively done by frameworks and rarely requires manual intervention. This is mostly enough, but an unsolved problem for me was to keep data private and survive a browser window reload as I can only do one with any kind of certainty. I am reasonably sure this is not possible since every available storage is also available to other scripts as is requesting data from server without authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage"&gt;sessionStorage&lt;/a&gt; is preferred to localStorage. Any personal data should be removed with sessions that shouldn’t be long either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, if all my research and effort provided me with more comfort than they do. Maybe fear is just the price paid for remaining vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="web"></category><category term="secure"></category><category term="webapp"></category><category term="applications"></category></entry><entry><title>2018 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2018-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-14T21:38:05+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-14T21:38:05+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-01-14:/articles/2018-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just reread &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2017-review.html"&gt;my last year review&lt;/a&gt; and could copy first two paragraphs with few changes.

I am still fine, loved ones less so and there were new horrific organisational experiences to replace old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without wish or intent to go into much detail, this was a year in which our home had to be listed as a no-go location in a restraining order and I observed Slovenian police and justice system dealing with credible threats to life and continue failing miserably to this day. Not all failures come down to sex, but being a woman certainly seems to make things worse for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I ended last year in a much better mood than I started or was for much of the year. No doubt visiting &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157703189184404"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157673205196187"&gt;Réunion&lt;/a&gt;, while physically taxing, helped a lot. As did summer visit from friends, hiking more than ever, building Legos and working on a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently a British minister &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/culture-secretary-jeremy-wright-reveals-his-love-of-lego"&gt;was ridiculed&lt;/a&gt; for playing with Lego sets, but I can only recommend it, especially to those under stress. Calming effect of putting bricks together and satisfaction of building something is truly relaxing. I don’t know what I might do this year, but last year I build Taj Mahal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Taj Mahal" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1752/41908286734_e18c334767_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I would also like to build something more useful and less tactile. I made prototypes to test the idea of an email Instapaper at the end of last year and hope to get it running some time this year, if I can resolve problems around financially tolerable and reliable email delivery. It might even lead to some fresh content on this website if I write up an idea or two after I test it with this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I did &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html"&gt;not read much&lt;/a&gt;, but we hiked often which really paid off in Réunion where a bout of dengue led me to carrying heavier than expected backpack for days at end. Possibly was the fittest I’ve ever been and if I could get into the same shape this year while improving my diet and losing some weight, then that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main goal last year was to take care of loved ones. I cannot remember why I felt it necessary to state this as it is, will be and should be most important thing I do every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to give myself a pass again for not doing much else. I felt getting stupider this year, which was a wholly unenjoyable experience. 2019 is the year of my new, less flattering demographic age bracket, but I will not be remotely old enough that dulling of intellect would be expected or acceptable. I suspect this “development” had a lot do with what and how much I read last year and I will focus my efforts there to expand my general knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of learning, I did not make much progress with Spanish last year and won’t first few months of this year either. At some point (spring?) I’ll have to if I don’t want to forget what I already learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans for 2019 are unintentionally vague so there is a good chance that I could in some sense fulfil more than usual including another long trip abroad. There is one thing I want to change from 2018 and that is just being more intentional in whatever I will do. Nothing seems to make time feel wasted so reliably than spending it without a forethought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2018"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2018</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-01T22:50:30+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-01T22:50:30+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-01-01:/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;…were too few.

Even worse than 2016 from which I lifted this post’s beginning. At least none of them were duds. All of them are worth reading, but I reserved bold for those that are not too niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links lead to Smile Amazon. I still get nothing from referrals, but at least some charity might get few cents instead of also nothing. Brodeck Report is lacking a link because graphic novel has not been translated to English yet. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Magic-Watches-Smart-Introduction-Watchmaking/dp/2940506124/"&gt;The Magic of Watches&lt;/a&gt; by Louis Nardin. A very fine introduction to the world of (wrist)watches and one of the best designed books I own. A very good introduction for already interested that is at its weakest when it is trying to sell you this hobby, but more than makes up for it elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Platero-Spanish-Juan-Ramon-Jim%C3%A9nez/dp/9706665641/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8"&gt;Platero y Yo&lt;/a&gt; by Juan Ramon Jiménez&lt;/strong&gt;. Bittersweet stories about author's friendship with a donkey. Above my Spanish level and will have to read it again some day. Lovely prose where my understanding was not too foggy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brodeckovo poročilo (Brodeck Report) by Manu Larcenet&lt;/strong&gt;. A fantastic graphic novel based on a novel by Philippe Claudel about difference and intolerance in a village near French-German border soon after WW2. Wonderfully drawn and impactful, it would be difficult to imagine it is not doing justice to original material which I have not read yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Architecting-Angular-Applications-Redux-RxJS/dp/1787122409/"&gt;Architecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJS, and NgRx&lt;/a&gt; by Christoffer Noring. I have mixed feelings about this book. It is a good introduction to the topic, but I am still not persuaded about the approach. I have some qualms about organisation of the content as the book seems to be confused about who its audience is and certainly about many technical mistakes in code samples, but I would still recommend it as the best introduction to those who need to get acquainted with its topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mistletoe-Murder-Other-Stories/dp/1101973803/"&gt;The Mistletoe Murder and Other Stories&lt;/a&gt; by P.D. James&lt;/strong&gt;. Judging by this book P.D. James deserved her high reputation. Crime stories best read around Christmas, all of them superbly conceived and written. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan for this year is simply to get into a habit of reading books again with a healthy mixture of fiction and non-fiction. No particular number in mind, but single digit would be disappointing as it would mean I again wasted too much stuff on mostly short fluff found on the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great, if I managed to rise to last year’s challenge of reading a book in each to me  familiar language, but probably won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 has inherited everything needed to be another bad year and my only real goal for this year is to try to make it passable. Take care of loved ones. Everything else will be delegated to modest hopes and ambitions without firm commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger ambitions in 2017 were sunk in a stream of events that taught me at the very least that there are different kinds of lost years. I wouldn’t change anything if I had to relive this one so at least regrets were not compounded. Well, almost. Profound sadness from the start of 2017 developed into anger that certainly exhibited itself in my crankiness. For this I am very sorry. Otherwise I am fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 really proved how important it is to take care of your health and I did it with mixed results. On one hand I continued to meditate and averaged almost 50 minutes of recreation per day. I also got noticeably overweight and certainly not from a well balanced diet. I do not feel too bad about this, considering the year, as I am prone to comfort eating, but I would prefer a year with only half as much exercise if I also fixed my weight and diet. Also, long term stress &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I haven’t done any homeconfs, nor did I build anything new nor find a new hobby. I was too preoccupied with problems at home to indulge in a quest for bigger problems to solve. My Spanish definitely stagnated which is something I definitely want to change this year. I would love to scrape together enough time for at least some of the listed wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this year eases on character-building experiences, then I’d like to give my learning more direction and depth. Spend less time on things that become quickly obsolete if they are not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published here rarely because I wrote rarely. What I did write reads clunky and awkward and more practice is sorely needed. It would be almost impossible to publish less than I did last year, but another such year might help if it unshackles me from a self-imposed expectation of finishing the things I started. Curious to see how this turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking of it, 2018 looks like a maintenance year. By which I don’t mean to forsake anything new, but my focus will definitely be on solving existing issues instead of creating new ones. Let’s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2017</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-01T13:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T13:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2018-01-01:/articles/books-i-read-in-2017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cannot say much good about 2017, but at least I read a bunch of books.

More even than I hoped and fewer than I would if I hadn’t slacked off at the end of last year. Not a bad selection either with no duds, but maybe too many work oriented choices and overall intellectually somewhat shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every year unaffiliated links point to Amazon. They represent mild endorsement and I would also include the two unlinked ones if I could find a place where you can get them online. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them and translations or originals may be worse or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bold, as always, is reserved for those I would recommend: &lt;em&gt;Austerlitz, Stories of Your Life And Others&lt;/em&gt;, a sequel &lt;em&gt;The Arab of the Future 2, Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; and a non-fiction book &lt;em&gt;The Mom Test&lt;/em&gt;. Of these I would recommend Austerlitz the most even though I am certain it will not be to everyone’s liking. The second book worthy of a special mention is The Mom Test which I believe is the first exception to my unstated policy (until now) of recommending only fiction and general interest non-fiction books. Even if you are not trying to start a business it is still useful to learn how to get useful information and feedback from people without resorting to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mohorjeva.com/knjige_buecher/detajl/judje-na-slovenskem"&gt;Judje na Slovenskem (Jews in Slovenian ethnic territory)&lt;/a&gt; by Klemen Jelinčič Boeta. A very short, at time enumerative but always informative history of Jews in Slovenian territories. I became nauseous when reading about 19th and most of 20th century, but would recommend it even more for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0989387003/"&gt;How to Improve Your Foreign Language Immediately&lt;/a&gt; by Boris Shekhtman. A very to the point book on techniques you can use to improve how you learn (any) new language. Too early  to tell how well they work, but they and exercises look promising and useful also for improving communication in native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microinteractions-Full-Color-Designing-Details/dp/1491945923"&gt;Microinteractions: Designing with Details&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Saffer. Detailed examination of microinteractions, what makes them work and how to use them to build experiences that are pleasant and memorable. Recommended reading for UX designers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Austerlitz-W-G-Sebald/dp/0375504834"&gt;Austerlitz&lt;/a&gt; by W.G.Sebald&lt;/strong&gt;. I am struggling to describe this very fine book without saying too much while saying too little. Almost dreamlike, impressionistic meditation where a lot transpires without much happening. Very recommended and worth persisting even if it does not grab you immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mobile-App-Development-Ionic-Cross-Platform/dp/1491937785/"&gt;Mobile App Development with Ionic 2&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Griffith. A good introduction to Ionic2 for those new to it. I would like it more if it was more focused (comments related to Ionic 1 are not really useful to anyone) and if testing apps received more space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374117268/"&gt;A Burglar's Guide to the City&lt;/a&gt; by Geoff Manaugh. A book most easily enjoyed if approached as light entertainment. Starting from an intriguing premise, full of interesting anecdotes and some interesting information, it still felt too long with too little to say. Do not expect a guide!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1101972122"&gt;Stories Of Your Life And Others&lt;/a&gt; by Ted Chiang&lt;/strong&gt;. I feel I should have liked it more than I did. Every story is original and thought provoking, most of them well written and none badly. Cannot think of a reason why I would not recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Longest-Afternoon-Decided-Battle-Waterloo/dp/0465064825"&gt;The Longest Afternoon: The 400 Men Who Decided the Battle of Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; by Brendan Simms. Title really sums it up and I can recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the battle of Waterloo. Gripping read that takes no longer than your average movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1984-1985-Graphic/dp/1627793518"&gt;The Arab of the Future 2: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1984-1985&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf&lt;/strong&gt;. Next instalment in trilogy and as good as the first one. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fever-Dream-Novel-Samanta-Schweblin/dp/0399184597"&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/a&gt; by Samanta Schweblin&lt;/strong&gt;. A difficult book to discuss without saying too much, but it is one of the most gripping books I remember reading. Probably unfilmable, but stories don't come much better than this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nemška loterija (German Lottery) by Miha Mazzini. I enjoyed reading this book more than his recent columns (rants). While twist itself will not surprise you, it is well written with some ideas that may elevate it above most summer reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angular-Cookbook-Second-Matt-Frisbie/dp/1785881922/"&gt;Angular 2 Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Matt Frisbie. An excellent combination of tips and introduction to Angular 2+ that I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn this framework. It has few minor errors, but none (yet) that would really matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Solutions-Everyday-Problems/dp/1449372635/"&gt;CSS Secrets: Better Solutions to Everyday Problems&lt;/a&gt; by Lea Verou. Fantastic book for practically every web frontend developer. At its most superficial it is a well organised cookbook of mostly excellent solutions to commonly found problems. However its real value lies in author's explanations which can teach almost everyone something on how to go about solving CSS challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-SVG-Chris-Coyier/dp/193755743X"&gt;Practical SVG&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Coyier. A fine introduction to using SVG effectively. If like me you want information about SVG internals, then this is probably not the book you want. Nevertheless it already has proved useful to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019"&gt;Badass: Making Users Awesome&lt;/a&gt; by Kathy Sierra. I am a big fan of Kathy, but am a bit perplexed by this book. It's central thesis is interesting: building loyalty by focusing on user's development, but I am not sure how widely can this be used and some research it relies on is questionable. Still, if nothing else it gives you good advice on how to effectively improve your own skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CYFY366/"&gt;Emil und die Detektive (Emil and the Detectives)&lt;/a&gt; by Erich Kästner. I read this book first when I was about Emil Tischbein's age and this fun story aged surprisingly well with its humanistic core as relevant now as it was when it was written. Still, best suited for children and those looking for an easy way in to polishing their German.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interface-Animation-Val-Head-ebook/dp/B01J4NKSZA/"&gt;Designing Interface Animation: Meaningful Motion for User Experience&lt;/a&gt; by Val Head. A good primer on why and how to use animation effectively in interface design. It is at its weakest, as this type of books generally are, when discussing how to incorporate it in work processes, but all of it is worth reading and I would especially recommend reading e-book version as it makes it easier to use included links to video demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Family-Trade-Charles-Stross/dp/1427263108"&gt;The Family Trade&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Stross. A book I probably read at a wrong time. A well written engaging story with mostly compelling characters that sometimes exhibit implausible adaptability to circumstances. An abrupt end on account of book's publishing history did not bother me as much as I expected. Stross is clearly a talented storyteller and I suspect I would like this book more if I read it a couple of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742"&gt;The Mom Test&lt;/a&gt; by Rob Fitzpatrick&lt;/strong&gt;. Possibly the best business book I've ever read. Excellent advice on practically every aspect of customer discovery without any fluff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Učna ura ustvarjalnega pisanja (Lessons or creative writing) by Michal Viewegh. A decent entertainment for a short afternoon with some good lines and with an opinion on good literature that I don't subscribe to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year my plan is again to read about 15 books with work related kind being in clear minority, but numbers are not everything and I would be happy even with only 10 mind-stretching ones. I am looking for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_the_Khazars"&gt;Dictionary of the Khazars&lt;/a&gt; (Hazarski rečnik) in Serbian so any tip would be appreciated. Another challenge to myself is to read at least a book in every language I know well enough. I suspect this is ambitious enough for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

As it happens we recently came back from our trip to Sicily where Google Maps was for the first time our primary navigation tool. Results were mixed, but all in all it is a remarkably mediocre product for something that was launched more than a decade ago and its interface contributed a lot to overall impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem with Google Maps is that you can get stuck in an endless loop if you are in an unknown environment. I don't actually know how navigation apps calculate routes, but from my observations and being aware of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem"&gt;shortest path problem&lt;/a&gt; it looks like full optimisation is done only for "nearby" destinations and around edges of routes to more distant ones. If your destination is far enough then it will fall-back to using main roads for most of your journey and god help you if one of them has a recently closed section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving Agrigento late in the evening we kept being rerouted to the same stretch of closed road. We finally "saved" ourselves by selecting an intermediate destination that formed large enough triangle with our final destination that once reached it was unlikely we would be driven back to by then very familiar blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Google obviously can't learn in advance for all roads when they will be closed. But for a company that prides itself on its machine learning/AI chops it could well notice when all these phones it is tracking stop going through some major route. Especially if they fail to take it after they are repeatedly guided through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I bought what was then practically the cheapest Garmin and one of its features I liked a lot was that it showed how fast I was driving and what the current speed limit was. It wasn't perfect as limits change more often than maps and I can understand why a company like Google prefers not to show that, but I still found current velocity useful as it was far more reliable than car's speedometer. In EU indicated speed must be between 100-110% of real one plus an allowance of additional 4km/h at specified test speeds which means you might be going only 80km/h when gauge is telling you 92km/h. Velocity calculated from averaged GPS positions is simply more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fast driver and I would not care much about this indicator if I could rely more on arrival time estimates. I clearly am not the kind of driver Google expects. This is most obvious on highways where I would need to drive close to speed limit to meet them and I can't because there is no reliable way to know how fast we are going. On most of our trips there simply are not enough mountain ascents to compensate for those "lost" minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally Google Maps assumes options would only unduly burden our feeble minds so it either hides or completely removes them. There are often no alternatives to routes and certainly not once one is selected. The only possible reason to use navigation, it seems, is to get to your destination as quickly as possible and prepare to suffer trying to persuade the app to take a less direct scenic road. When you get to your destination, it will consider its job done and without confirmation stop navigating even if you haven't actually spotted it yet or will need to park somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its limited flexibility and customisability can be infuriating. You don't like the voice used in navigation? Change system wide language settings. Is it too chatty? Turn off or put up. Would you like to go to a previously entered destination? Can't do if you don't also store this information on Google's servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Google Maps was launched, it had a very vivid palette which was later watered down to more pleasingly looking pastels that are also harder to discern, especially in non-ideal conditions such as on a phone in a car on a very sunny day. Most of the time it is fine, but night colours are just obtuse. Who thought that grey, blue and black form a high enough contrast in context where I can reasonably afford only glances at a relatively small screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of night-time colour palette. Why does it switch on immediately after sunset? My phone is more than happy to adjust screen brightness based on brightness of its surrounding, so why does it not use that same sensor to decide when it is actually dark enough to switch colours? Of course you can't change colours either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way it feels petty to spend so many words complaining about something which in its essence I still find remarkable. The fact that you can navigate your way around this planet using a small, relatively affordable gadget with often current traffic updates is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not singular and has not been even before Google Maps was launched. While it is adding new things it is failing many common, if not basic, requirements that were implemented by its less moneyed competitors years ago. Many of these limitations are clearly self-serving. For example there really is no good technical reason for not storing locally previously visited locations. Its offline mode is also limited both in maximum covered area size and (complete?) lack of navigation features. Feasibility of both has, again, been amply demonstrated years ago by others on much more constrained devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constraints are also not financial as implementing and supporting these features on a couple of platforms pales in comparison with resources needed to continuously map and photograph this planet. They are not there because they would be expensive. They are missing because what Google wants is a paternalistic relationship where you regularly feed the beast with new data. And you do that by being tethered to their servers, storing on them even information that doesn't need to be there and responding positively to almost constant nagging to provide pictures of your current location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few products achieve perfection. Most have to settle on a compromise between what is currently feasible, desired by users and required by company. Judging them by some unattainable ideal would be absurd, but Google Maps, while doubtlessly useful, still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="google maps"></category><category term="app"></category><category term="critique"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>2016 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2016-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-29T12:15:52+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T12:15:52+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-29:/articles/2016-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/1779/"&gt;&lt;img alt="XKCD comic: 2017" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2017.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic.

&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; seminal, but for wrong reasons and I will think twice next time I feel optimistic. The most positive thing I can think of about 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning and text  editor wiped out most of the early version of this review which is one of the reasons why it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not contribute to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae. Since I seem to be mostly fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of the excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest personal change last year was freelancing again full time, which at times felt all consuming. It was a medium success. I am not in danger of being hungry, am working on things I find interesting and have learned a lot including that I don't like the "traditional" model of freelancing with many, relatively short engagements. Instead I prefer to work on longer lasting projects with at most two clients at a time which is what I am doing now. I am not sure if this could still be adequately described as freelancing or consulting, but it certainly does not feel like employment either. Finding correct label will probably wait until I have a need for one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side I learned how I work best by failing some of my clients for which I still feel guilty and ashamed. Another problem is answering what do I do. For example I spend a lot of time last year improving my &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; related skills, but effectively did not use them professionally and this year is shaping to be similar. There is a saying that you are in whatever business your customers think you are in. Clearly theirs and my perception were not aligned and it would be nice if this year I succeeded in answering at least who gets to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly freelancing also changed my perception of time which I never felt I have an abundance of. I can't tell how much of a book I will read in an hour or how many useful lines of code will be produced, so wasting it just gives me some vague feeling of loss. However because money is fungible, charging for time makes such loses more comparable to some things I care about (and admittedly to neither of my examples). It probably is a form of greed even though me getting something is rarely what it ends up being compared to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a trap which somewhat paradoxically becomes worse if you raise your rate. I have colleagues who have difficulty taking time off because they now know almost exactly how much that would cost them. But it can also be useful if turned into a question if what I am doing right now is the most appropriate use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I set a goal of giving at least one talk in 2016. I did 4, most of them on the same topic and while I enjoyed presenting, I do not expect to do it in 2017. Neither will I be setting development goals for this year even as I am expecting to learn a lot. In 2016 I learned 4 different Javascript frameworks because of work and I expect what I do to guide most of what I learn this year as well. Open source work will likely suffer too, but I plan to continue being involved in organising local Javascript events which I started to do at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion of the general state of journalism sank to a new low last year, but there are exceptions and I was happy to be involved with &lt;a href="https://podcrto.si"&gt;Pod črto&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this year I am trying to reduce my obligations and ambitions, it would be great if I could do more work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more, but mostly not the kind of things I had in mind when I set that goal. Hopefully this year will be better including keeping the old promise of having a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to find time for a new hobby. Something that is fun to do even when you have only minutes to spare, is not computer related and is hopefully more tactile, like building with Legos that I already have. Also spend more effort learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still all this is is just tweaking life as it passes. Last year and especially last few months of it, as I observed world with increasing horror, I kept thinking what the right response should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it isn't doing nothing. There are no problems needing me to be solved, but even my own experience proves that getting involved can matter. Life fully lived is more than just a pursuit of personal comfort and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; once said that you should always ask yourself what is the most important problem that needs solving and how you can contribute most. I feel stuck responding to his two part challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, identifying the most important problem to work on, suffers from abundance of choice. Climate change with all its consequences, EU project continuing viability, rise of (rightwing) populism etc. Right now I am pretty much unqualified to meaningfully help with any of them, but I do feel slightly more qualified about an issue that connects them all which is the role of modern media and the way (mis)information spreads. As this post is already tryingly long, I won't go &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f00ec8cdfcb#.uipgk19ru"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/12/eleven-tweets.html#more"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/facebooks-walled-wonderland-is-inherently-incompatible-with-news-media-b145e2d0078c#.ddp42t5wu"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-americans-against-trump-can-learn-from-the-failures-of-the-israeli-opposition?intcid=mod-latest"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2955021/shirtless-trump-saves-drowning-kitten/#pq=VD83C8"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which does not make choosing ways to get involved easier. Writing code is unlikely to be helpful if you are not a part of the teams working on platforms that matter (Facebook, Twitter) and I never will be. Even if I were, ideas currently discussed are unlikely to be effective or can be just as easily abused to make things worse. There might be space for activism. Having done it before, I know how difficult it can be and how temperamentally unsuited I am for it. Before I worry too much about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to achieve my goals, I need to establish &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't feel much certainty at the moment, but what I am certain of is that the idea of "Reader", that kept cropping up on this site, is dead. I would still love to have such tool, but last year thoroughly proved it is at best a solution to a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2016</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-01T22:38:56+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-01T22:38:56+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-01:/articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;...were very few.

I have never read so few books since I learned to read. My list would be even shorter if it did not contain three items ambitiously described as books by publishers. If I change nothing this year, I will definitely change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say I did not read much. It was a US presidential election year and I read too many things that on the whole did not do me much good except further erode an already low opinion of mainstream journalism. I may (or not) come back to this in my annual review of past year. Also watched too much (good) TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly all my reading was done either on tablet (first 4 items) or Kindle (last two), both of which worked well and neither being perfect. However I expect this to be more common as convenience can't be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read much, but I can still recommend one book: The Oracle of Oil. Generally, I don't see a point in reading biographies and reading a book from the author you personally know also carries a risk of what to do if you don't like their work. Luckily for me Mason's book is excellent. A meticulously researched and engaging story of a father of peak oil kept me interested all the way through and left me pondering the power of wishful groupthink and (in)effectiveness of data substantiated arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured/dp/1491901942/"&gt;AngularJS Up &amp;amp; Running&lt;/a&gt; by  Shyam Seshadri and Brad Green . A good introduction to 1.x version of AngularJS framework that gives you a solid overview of what can be done and how you should go about it without getting lost in advanced specifics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI57PWo6HRAhVNeVAKHSQCA0kQFggaMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fweb-development%2Freactjs-essentials&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFce0pG40bQZb-AQTvziAd2Uxkowg"&gt;React.js Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by Artemij Fedosejev. A gentle introduction to React.js and Flux avoiding rest of React's ecosystem as it does building complex, multi-screen applications. Still good first book to read on the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/the-secrets-behind-great-one-on-one-meetings"&gt;The Secrets Behind Great One-On-One Meetings&lt;/a&gt; by Esther Schindler. From a series of recent O'Reilly short books (booklets?). Excellent guide on how to conduct effective one-on-one meetings (or receving one). Recommended for everyone with a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/designing-culture.pdf"&gt;Designing Culture&lt;/a&gt; by Kristi Woolsey. Another booklet, but not as good as the previous one. Too few practical examples and because of author's background it focuses mainly on using architecture/design to influence culture. Still useful if you are in a position to influence or change working environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Mujer Alta by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón. Not so much a book as a short story, but it was the first longer text I read mostly in Spanish (with &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of help from interleaved English text). It is a story I suspect just did not age well since 19th century when it was written. Skip unless you are learning Spanish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Oil-Maverick-Geologists-Sustainable/dp/0393239683/"&gt;The Oracle of Oil: A Maverick Geologist's Quest for a Sustainable Future&lt;/a&gt; by Mason Inman.&lt;/strong&gt; An engaging biography of M.K.Hubbert, the father of "peak oil". It is more than just a story of a brilliant man pushing an unpopular view and provides an opportunity to draw lessons still relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I will achieve my plan of reading more books than last year as I could hardly read fewer. Some fiction would be nice and another Spanish book would be welcome too. My goal is again 15 books, but if I don't read at least 10, then, well... I have a year to think of a suitable punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
