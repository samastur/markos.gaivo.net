  Yesterday was my last working day at my

   current job

  as a head of front-end development. I really admire what Jure and his team have done so far and it will be a real challenge to keep up with his tempo. I’m also looking forward to solving problems that will make our extension, which I’m sure you already have, even more friendly and useful. Hopefully some of those problems will result in content on this blog that is worth reading.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the meantime I have few days of vacation that will hopefully be spent on resting and cleaning up various tasks that pilled up in last few months.

  I left my last job more than two years ago to start working in my own
  &lt;a href="http://www.neko.si/" title="Neko d.o.o."&gt;
   company
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and I never regretted this decision. In fact, I have had so much fun I couldn’t imagine to go and work for some other company ever again.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Well, as saying goes, never …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  I got an excellent opportunity from like-minded people to further my goals of improving the state of Slovenian web, so from 4th of December I split my time between
  &lt;a href="http://www.neko.si/"&gt;
   Neko
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and
  &lt;a href="http://www.parsek.si"&gt;
   Parsek
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , where as their head of development I’ll have an opportunity to raise the bar on what can and should be expected from a modern website.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This also means I’ll have less time to work on other things, so if you are not a charity or we haven’t talked yet, then I probably won’t have time to work on your project.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As year is coming to an end I’d also like to use this opportunity to wish happy holidays to all of you and all the best in new year.

  I used to be a part-time system administrator and have a few colleagues who still are. So I’m fairly used to regular complaints about (l)users and a delusional sense of self-importance. Yet, it’s still a rare week in which I’d read a bunch of articles (with comments) like
  &lt;a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html"&gt;
   this one
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and had so many discussions about what and how should our users behave.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I think most comments were simply rubbish. You have no reason to complain as long as they are polite and not intentionally obstructive.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The thing I always admired about
  &lt;a href="http://www.mobitel.si"&gt;
   Mobitel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is the way they treat their customers. It doesn’t matter how little do they know about phones, phone plans or even their own needs and desires, you can be sure that Mobitel’s personnel will take the time and energy necessary to explain, show and resolve whatever is needed. They certainly don’t expect me to come loaded with information and spend more of my time to save theirs.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I know next to nothing about plumbing and I’m sure it’s a fact well known and obvious to every plumber I’ve met. But did they ever treat me like an idiot? No, because it’s understood that they have to know so I don’t have to. I simply can’t know everything and wouldn’t want to, because there are other, more important things that I should be doing. I might help with my answers to their questions, but it’s not really expected of me to do anything more than to show the problem.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I understand frustrations when dealing with too many problems and too little time. I also know that there’s always a small percentage of users who simply are assholes. I don’t believe it’s ever acceptable to be impolite, but I understand it sometimes happens.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Life can be hard, but it doesn’t change the fact that our task is to provide a service, to serve our users and not the other way around. And if we have a problem doing this, it’s us who must resolve it not them. In fact, without them  “pests” there’s little need for what we provide. After all a perfectly configured and RFC compliant mail server is just a box of toxic waste without someone sending emails through it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Some professions get this. As Woody Allen rightly pointed out, it really is a bitch to get a plumber (on Sunday).
 &lt;/p&gt;
