  Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I’ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.

 &lt;/p&gt;

  I’ve been going back and forth over this and I can’t say I’m any wiser.
