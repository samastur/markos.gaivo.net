    Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I’ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.

    I was talking to a friend yesterday who’d like to put up a website displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can’t say I persuaded even myself.

   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
