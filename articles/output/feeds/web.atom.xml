    Disappointed I stopped using Twitter at the end of 2011 and have since visited it mostly to follow up specific references. As a medium I found it lacking but ignorable until recently. While I was reading about the aptly named
    &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/nUX1A"&gt;
     Jacobinghazi affair
    &lt;/a&gt;
    I felt the urge to tweet and pronounce Twitter as possibly
    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samastur/status/476707986006880256"&gt;
     more toxic than Facebook
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This article has been provoked by
    &lt;a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/"&gt;
     Tomaž’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    polite disagreement and is my late attempt to explain what I couldn’t on Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    My objections
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Leon Wieseltier recently described Twitter as
    &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118125/leon-wieseltier-responds-alain-de-bottons-attack-twitter"&gt;
     a place of infinite discharge of emotion and promotion
    &lt;/a&gt;
    where nothing intellectually or linguistically substantial can be accomplished. It is a great and true enough description of Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Over the years a number of articles have discussed effects of new media on society in its largest sense. While I am interested in those my comment was mainly about Twitter’s role in shaping how individuals and communities think, communicate and behave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In blogging heyday I thoroughly disliked celebration of rapid exchange of half-baked ideas. Making them smaller and exchange more rapid is not an improvement. Ideas have always been cheap and plentiful when untested and inspiring to the unwitting. Twitter is vast and there may be much worth reading, but chances are most of what you will read will be soon forgotten fluff. Creating on a medium like Twitter is hard since most things worth saying can’t be clearly expressed in 140 characters, nuance is valued even less than continuity and every good tweet can be buried in a pile of inane responses.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One of the reasons why I originally stopped using Twitter was realisation that I found tweets from a fair number of otherwise congenial and intelligent people regularly off-putting. Twitter did not suddenly found their previously hidden depravity, instead its forced brevity of semi-public discourse made a great deal of it sound like movie informants wearing a wire. It is a great demonstration of how dialogue changes when we think others are listening and an insidious tool for normalising blanket snooping, much of it our own.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Research has shown that our brains keep adapting to their use and improving one skill often leads to deterioration of another or as McLuhan put it: “Every extension is also an amputation.” I lost count of people describing their difficulty with reading longer, more slowly developing articles after an expectation of instant gratification has been built by a steady diet of short ones. It doesn’t get more instant than a tweet and Twitter’s interface is optimised for non-discriminative reading of a never ending stream of tweets.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-1-note" id="twitter-toxic-1"&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Can this really be good for a thinking person?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My tweet which led to this piece was provoked by an absolutely absurd argument closely matching Alan Jacob’s description of
    &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2013/12/twitter-at-its-worst.html"&gt;
     Twitter at its worst
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Maybe worst, but certainly not rare. Of course arguments with all the negative baggage are not exclusive to Twitter, but Twitter does seem a more emotive medium than most of them. Discussions on Twitter are commonly a sad sight because it isn’t built for dialog. It is a marketing machine and works best when used as such.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-2-note" id="twitter-toxic-2"&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Unsurprisingly millions of its users conform to its design hints by sharing content or less obviously with signalling group membership by snarking and sloganeering at sometimes only imagined opposition.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    about the nature of online fame recently made rounds and I can’t recommend it enough. Fame can appear without being sought and the longer it lasts, the more likely it is that the famous will become a stand-in for a concept to which public often responds negatively. This is especially unpleasant and difficult to deal with when the negative concept is tied not to what you did, but who you are or are perceived to be.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On Twitter (as previously noted) tweets may be written with a recipient in mind, but can be seen by anyone so all of them contribute to our public image without it being in our control.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-4-note" id="twitter-toxic-4"&gt;
      [4]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Controlling tweets comprehension and propagation by relying on cultural norms to differentiate audiences does not work because those norms may not be well known and are certainly not accepted by everyone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We speak when we want to pass on an idea. Amplifying ideas of others can be worthy, but we are more enriched when new ideas are created and explored. The really interesting ones can be controversial, rough and in need of a nurturing environment in which to develop. Twitter is not that place.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mobbing and repression of unpopular opinion happens almost everywhere where opinions can be expressed, but the immediacy, ease of response and pay-off make Twitter particularly popular with trolls, sociopaths and anybody willing to goad their followers into collective sectarian hysteria. There will always be enough of them willing to tweet before thinking to pummel into silence everyone but the most determined. Only ideas at first protected by obscurity can develop and flourish in environment without boundaries.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Three pillars of Twitter design
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter earns money by showing ads. There’s another reason to be careful with any ad-based business beyond worrying about their usually insatiable hunger for our privacy. Its value is proportional to the amount of our time it captures.
    &lt;sup&gt;
     &lt;a href="#twitter-toxic-5-note" id="twitter-toxic-5"&gt;
      [5]
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
    Seeing ads on a site you frequent should trigger an examination of how much time you are willing to spend there.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I disliked Twitter’s design until I realised that its main purposes are spreading messages and increasing its use. It does those two things splendidly and kudos to Twitter’s designers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am obviously not privy to any internal information, but to me the foundation of Twitter’s design are three main values: terseness, immediacy and broadcasting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Terseness is of course the well known restriction of 140 characters per tweet because of a technical limitation which does not really exist any more. Its effect on writing however remains because writing thoughts longer than 140 characters is awkward and will in newest-tweets-first Twitter applications always result in a broken reading experience. It is ill-suited for human dialogue because we don’t express ourselves at tweet lengths and we don’t hear responses first. Life is not
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!"&gt;
     Jeopardy!
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and it is not a coincidence that most messaging applications put newest messages at the bottom.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why doesn’t Twitter raise the limit? I can only speculate, but I believe there are other benefits to Twitter beyond the limit’s role in Twitter’s brand. Longer text simply requires more effort from writer and readers and makes the platform less engaging thus hurting both of the stated Twitter’s goals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter does not use time much as a design tool beyond a core belief that real time is the right time to deliver a message and that delivered messages should be displayed in the opposite order they were sent which at some point will practically guarantee broken narratives and constant change of topic.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most of us can’t effectively multitask because we can’t quickly switch contexts. We cognitively suffer when we try and reading tweets from unconnected authors in order in which they came is really just multitasking at high speed. There is no reason to believe that we listen as well and care as much as we would if our focus would not be constantly drawn to the next thing. Ability to listen fully and steadily is a difficult skill to develop, but quick to atrophy on Twitter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Twitter may tolerate a moderate use of its platform, but certainly does not want it. It will keep suggesting new people to follow no matter how many you already do to keep the stream of tweets from ever drying up. Without them you don’t have a reason to constantly check your phone for new tweets and fewer reasons to post your own.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other face of broadcasting is building up your audience which is how you’ll eventually see your followers once you get enough of them to not know many. And ever so helpful Twitter is here to get you to this point as quickly as possible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First it provides a crude privacy model in which either everything is private or nothing is (ignoring direct messages that are irrelevant for this article). This not so gentle nudge to make output public is further supported by ubiquitous leader boards tracking followers, retweets and favourites, constantly reminding us of everyone’s standing and relying on our vanity to improve it. None of these would need to be so prominent if what really mattered was sharing and chatting with your friends. Putting a scorecard on our every utterance makes sense only if its most important feature is their popularity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Hoarding followers and followees has another negative effect beside making already described ones worse. For historical reasons and because of web app limitations twitterers often use just one account, so subscribing to it conflates all author’s interests into one stream and while not merging different communities, it certainly exposes them more without them having much say in it. This, together with stilted expression, reduced comprehension and empathy, on a platform that promotes making an instant idiot of yourself in pursuit of recognition is, in my opinion, an important contributing factor to many heated arguments.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    In closing
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is not an exhaustive list of issues I have with Twitter, not even important ones (e.g. obtuseness of relying on any one source for important information). Much of what I said is not unique to this service but a lot of it feels more excessive here. What makes it different is the platform’s growing presence and influence in our society by its successful co-opting of promoters in us. Doubtless there is a lot of good that happens on Twitter or because of it, but the platform is also bringing out the worst in us and I find its damaging effects more substantial.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Writing this article reminded me of a larger point I have not made before or not often enough. Technology is not morally neutral or unipolar let alone inherently positive and it frustrates me that discussions often try to cast it thus. As a practising technologist I am obviously not a Luddite, but neither do I assume that everything I am able to make is good even when made with best intentions. Our creations shape what we do, how we do it and even who we are and should therefore be critically examined for what they do for and to us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As tools transform us and our societies I find pining for previous times unproductive, but I do not subscribe to technological determinism. We used freons for decades, but were perfectly capable of finding suitable replacements when we realised that our fridges would eventually fry us. But we did have to first realise and accept that.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     I know there are other clients. Well, mostly were. Twitter has been very open with their intention of eventually replacing all of them with theirs which already is the only one that matters.

     and while I usually prefer written word, in this case I would recommend to invest 20 minutes into watching the original video.

      ↩
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="twitter-toxic-4-note"&gt;
     Since we can’t control which tweets will be seen by whom and which won’t, it is impossible in the long term to really shape their overall perception unless they are sufficiently dehumanised or we consistently act out only one persona.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I recently read
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Koster" rel="wikipedia" title="Raph Koster"&gt;
     Raph Koster
    &lt;/a&gt;

     Theory of Fun for Game Design
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1932111972" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1"/&gt;
    , which I can heartily recommend to anyone interested in what games are all about. But it’s this part on page 88 that really got my attention, since I can relate it to what I do:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison, though:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games are good at
      &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification" rel="wikipedia" title="Objectification"&gt;
       objectification
      &lt;/a&gt;
      . Stories are good at empathy.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
      Games are external — they are about people’s actions. Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal — they are about people’s emotions and thoughts.
     &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A lot has been said in last couple of years about
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic" rel="wikipedia" title="Game mechanic"&gt;
     game mechanics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or customization?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually means it wants to provoke action on visitor’s part. Intended action may be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or subscribe to blog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction with a visitor.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull, but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage" title="Amazon"&gt;
     Amazon.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    presents other side of spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren’t there to read an item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items, reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn’t be used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you make a more informed decision on what and when to include.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    I’ve returned from
    &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaajax/"&gt;
     @media ajax
    &lt;/a&gt;
    a few days ago, a fantastic event I hope to be able to visit next year. This post is not about what happened there. There are better summaries published, easily accessible by search engine of your choice. Well, good ones anyhow. Besides, I have a cold so I’m even less coherent than usual, so those who’ll continue, beware.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was however reminded again of a premise I’ve been thinking about every since
    &lt;a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/"&gt;
     Andy Clarke’s
    &lt;/a&gt;
    talk at @media 2006. Should websites look and behave the same way in all mainstream browsers or not?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been flipping my opinion on this through time, but it seems to me striving for same experience everywhere is not only tiresome, time consuming but also strategically counter-productive.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If a site works the same in all browsers, what incentives do browser laggards have to upgrade their browser?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not many if any. I think same experience for everyone approach has other downsides as well. New features should be tested before they can be standardized and by tested I mean used. Otherwise we’re left to perpetually build to the lower common denominator. Just like we do now and it simply sucks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are arguments in favor of same experience everywhere. In my opinion most sensible one is that a significantly different experience between browsers can be confusing to users. I do, however, think this is not worth worrying about.  In my experience, which is what I use when lacking better source of data, people in general don’t use multiple browsers. Those who do, will cope by either sticking to one browser per site or adjusting to differences. We’re not as dumb as we behave.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I used to despise “best seen on” or “optimized for” signs on websites and I still do when they mean they only work with a specified browser. I don’t think there’s anything wrong if website doesn’t shut out anyone, but it’s a bit nicer to some. In fact it’s what we already profess and do. We certainly don’t test all browsers that we used to even though there are still people using them. Not only don’t we test, we KNOW our sites don’t work the same in them. And if we already know and do this, why not also promote a better choice if we think there is one?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So what I’m trying to say without getting too deep into why is that I’ll try to build sites open to users of all browsers, but won’t be too timid to offer improved features when consistency is too difficult or impossible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve recently read couple of posts that left an impression on me. First one was Brad Neuberg’s about
    &lt;a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html"&gt;
     personal research agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I haven’t completed list of my problems yet, but I came far enough to know I’m not working on any of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The other one was about
    &lt;a href="http://www.entrepreneur2be.com/2007/08/26/idea-blog-socialnetworking-blog20/"&gt;
     Blog 2.0
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . I’m more interested in content manipulation than social interactions as Pownce and Marela are only two social networking applications I use. Still, ideas contained are intriguing and couple of days before
    &lt;a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/"&gt;
     Data Sharing Summit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is the right time to shamelessly pimp my views.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Build a social application and you will likely, sooner or later, encounter a dilemma in what your members will be building. Are their creations mainly personal, an expression of their creativity, or are they more of a place where people meet and engage?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most websites don’t fall squarely into one or the other. My blog feels personal not only because I picked the look and topics, but also because my voice is elevated above others. I doubt I would feel the same if comments could look like my posts. I like my place and freedom it offers me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s why I don’t care all that much about most networks and degrees of their openness. Really open social network would be interwoven into the fabric of web. I already have my page, I don’t need yet another one. If buddy list is desired, I can use FOAF. Sharing of my stuff? Feeds. Same answer for getting other people’s stuff. Starting a new network would mean creating a widget or a few that can be easily integrated in our sites, maybe some sort of a pinging service if expediency is important and offering a space for personal page for those, who don’t have it yet.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s amazing how little would need to be changed to implement ideas in Blog 2.0. Basic technology is already here, it’s just not used widely enough yet. Sure there are a few issues that need to be thought through, mainly to do with handling privacy correctly, but they are neither big nor really technological. And price for all this?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Maybe a bit less expediency in content propagation and a bit more work for network operators, who might need to learn to live with the same limitations that search engine developers do already. And I’m not even sure that is really necessary.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     Update:
    &lt;/em&gt;
    Thinking a bit more about this I would be happy enough if social network were just more inclusive. It’s fine that you can create an account and be busy on their platform, but it would be better if you could join and interact with a social network with your own node for as long as that met your needs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    Andy is among many feeling
    &lt;a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/06/whither_w3c/index.php"&gt;
     frustrated
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with slow progress of CSS3 specifications and role W3C plays or should play in their birth. Having no part in any standardization process with corresponding amount of experience in developing a specification, I’m certainly ill qualified for comment on it with any reasonable amount of certainty.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I am, for better or worse, a blogger and I was at WWW2007, so I do have an opinion that like any true blogger find irresistible not to share even if it is in all likelihood wrong. In short, I believe the current state is a result of fairly insignificant intersection between people feeling the pain and those able to do much about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At first we wanted to present information and nineties were largely spent developing tools to do so in efficient enough manner. Partial browser stagnation, Mozilla development and CSS2 together with HTML4/XHTML1 more or less brought it far enough that we started having bigger dreams, wanting to do new stuff with our data. Just displaying it on a page doesn’t feel enough anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    These days there is a lot of talk about semantic web, which doesn’t mean same to all people, but is mostly understood as adding meaning to published outputs in ways friendlier to later manipulation and hence more useful. Tools ranging from feeds and microformats to SPARQL might be different, but most are marching in same direction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This doesn’t mean that current set of standards are perfect, but they are good enough that most of W3C doesn’t see them as a still open problem and has moved on to work on other more important things. You can probably listen to Tim Berners-Lee for hours these days without him muttering words HTML or CSS. They are also good enough for general public, which doesn’t care much about how something is done as long as it appears to work, to get what it wants.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are approximately as many Pandas in world as developers with a sense of esthetics, so it is hardly surprising that people bothered enough with current state to complain are mainly designers who care about doing things right. Sadly they are not usually well represented in standards bodies and as mentioned there isn’t an outside pressure that could compensate.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The only hope I see for new push comes from browser makers who probably don’t want be relegated to a part of an easily replaceable platform for running Flash/Silverlight/Whathaveyou plugins. Hopefully money flowing to them from search engines is good enough to finance a greater effort than one done so far.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;

    I stumbled upon a
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Europe_map_1648.PNG"&gt;
     map of Europe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in the middle of 17th century while reading about
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus"&gt;
     Jan Hus
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe"&gt;
     John Wycliffe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and was surprised to learn how foreign it was to me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m a big fan of Google Earth (and Maps), but the thing that I don’t like is that I can only look at most recent information Google has. Normally this is what I want, but not always. I like the fact that
    &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=ljubljana&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;ll=45.762523,14.367714&amp;amp;spn=0.029101,0.083685&amp;amp;t=k&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" title="Map of Cerknica lake"&gt;
     photos
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of Cerknica lake were taken during one of seasonal droughts, since it makes it easy to find streams and sinks that are gone when lake is full of water. But what will happen if new photos will be taken when lake is full?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Information I can access now will be gone and I’ll only be able to wait for a better luck in the future. Google (and other map providers) have provided good tools for moving around three dimensions, but I’d like to be able to move in fourth as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Wouldn’t it be nice, if you could see how a place is changing through time or how did states change through centuries?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The problem is not so much technical as it is of information gathering. Obviously it’s getting harder (even impossible) to get reliable data  as you go further back in history, but that’s hardly a reason not to try at all. If you’d be interested in working on map of Europe of last couple of millennia, please let me know.

    Q: How can you tell that you’re at tech conference?
   &lt;/p&gt;

    A: The line in front of men’s toilets is longer.

    &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    has finished. It was great and I specially enjoyed presentations given by
    &lt;a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/"&gt;
     Nate Koechley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/"&gt;
     Andy Clarke
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Those two alone made going worthwhile and if you have a chance to see any of them, don’t miss the opportunity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The conference was much bigger this year, which is one thing I didn’t like. It was harder to find people you were looking for and even if you did find them, they were usually already occupied by somebody else. If you’re an introverted guy like me and not a natural orator, then it can be a bit difficult to make the most of the time you have. I didn’t, but I’m glad I finally met
    &lt;a href="http://www.clagnut.com/"&gt;
     Richard
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , who’s an even nicer guy in real life.

   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/"&gt;
      Eric Meyer
     &lt;/a&gt;
     talked about last 10 years of CSS. An interesting talk, but for me even more important, he explained to me why
     &lt;a href="css-margin-collapse.html"&gt;
      margin collapsing
     &lt;/a&gt;
     wasn’t a daft idea.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I went to a design panel with
     &lt;a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/"&gt;
      Jon Hicks
     &lt;/a&gt;
     ,
     &lt;a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php"&gt;
      Veerle Pieters
     &lt;/a&gt;
     and
     &lt;a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/"&gt;
      Cameron Moll
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , since I know a thing or two about Javascript, but I’m completely design illiterate, which this blog can only attest to. I can’t say how designers liked it, but it was certainly very educational for me. I knew I choose my colors as if I was colorblind, but I also discovered I need to learn more about grids.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/"&gt;
      Dave Shea
     &lt;/a&gt;
     gave a nice rundown of the state of web typography and pros and cons of different methods and Andy Budd entertainingly as always presented tricks and approaches to tackling browser bugs.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html"&gt;
      Jeffrey Veen
     &lt;/a&gt;
     talked about Web 2.0 and new applications and although he made quite a lot of good points, I’m not sure openness wins every time. My counter example would be instant messaging, where GTalk hasn’t changed the field much. I hope I’m wrong and this will change in the future.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Day two started with
     &lt;a href="http://www.simplebits.com/"&gt;
      Dan Cederholm’s
     &lt;/a&gt;
     interesting presentation, where I again learned a trick or two. I especially enjoyed the way to build scalable arrows using CSS.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Dan’s talk was followed with Javascript panel. Personally, I think the idea of centralized hosting of Javascript libraries to improve caching doesn’t make much sense. If nothing else you bet that your visitors will also be able to access your caching sites which might not always be true. It certainly isn’t in this part of the world, where partial break-downs are not all that uncommon. Still, the panel probably deserves its own post.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Cameron Moll also gave a presentation on the state of mobile web design. It wasn’t bad, but I hoped for more.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     Nate Koechley’s talk was a revelation. An incredible amount of good information and it’s been eye opening for me to learn about Yahoo’s experience. Scary that they build an internet explorer emulating layer for Yahoo Mail though (why didn’t they just drop the original code and start over?).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     I enjoyed last year’s session with Andy Clarke, so I decided to attend this years as well and I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve been a fan of Andy’s work for quite some time now and I’m definitely buying his book when it comes out. So should you.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So, this is it. I hope to be there again next year.

   &lt;p&gt;
    A Marela member notified us, that file upload doesn’t work in
    &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/"&gt;
     Opera Mini
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It’s true, because Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads which you can easily check by visiting two
    &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/inputfile/index.html"&gt;
     demo pages
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with valid XHTML. You shouldn’t see a file input element on either of them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe (but as an outsider obviously can’t prove) it lacks upload support for security reasons. Every web request handled by Opera Mini gets transported over a proxy, which fetches the page in questions and translates it in a compressed format suitable for viewing on small screen devices. This means that file uploads would be sent to proxy as well which depending on what is sent can be seen as a security violation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of course it does allow logging in websites, a potentially unsafe action, which puts my speculation on shaky grounds. But the true point of this article still stands. Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads.
   &lt;/p&gt;
