 &lt;p&gt;
  It’s nice to have friends, especially the generous kind who buy a new
  &lt;a href="http://www.europe.nokia.com/n80"&gt;
   Nokia N80
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and lend it to you even before they had a chance to use it themselves. I’m not sure if N80 is the best mobile in the world, but it is by far the best phone I’ve had in my hands. I’m left with few excuses from finishing my uploader and provided that other obligations don’t tax me too much, it should be finished in next week or so.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I’ve stumbled on two small problems. I’d like to automatically tag images with phone model on which they were taken, but I don’t know how to read it. Is this possible at all?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The other problem seems to be a limitation of PyS60 API or its documentation. You are limited to use of text as tab titles, which are too small for this to be useful. That’s why you see developers displaying tab title in place of application title. Is there a workaround for this?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Update:
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  As advised by
  &lt;a href="http://cyke64.googlepages.com/" title="cyke64's homepage"&gt;
   cyke64
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I found
  &lt;a href="http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=75744&amp;amp;highlight=phone+model"&gt;
   how to read
  &lt;/a&gt;
  phone model on Nokia’s forums. My project has been hit with a setback, since I also discovered there’s no version of Python for N80 yet.
 &lt;/p&gt;
