Those who know me should already know what I think and others would be smart to ignore pontifications of a random Internet stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have been following US presidential elections closely this year. Main result of this unhealthy obsession was waste of my time, nerves and that my already low opinion of news media has been further lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for this are many, but at the top of them it has to be how the "story" of Clinton emails was and still keeps being reported. Matthew Yglesias at Vox &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13500018/clinton-email-scandal-bullshit"&gt;explained it&lt;/a&gt; better than anyone else I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are a couple, to the story tangential, parts that bug me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, it’s certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Hillary Clinton — who is, again, his wife — also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what many of us, non-presidents, do too. However it seems obvious from hysterical reactions of last few months that most people actually do find it unusual. It is a view which in its essence is not any different from "why are you hiding it if you have done nothing wrong".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did we screw up development of Internet so much that it became more normal to be suspicious of running your own instance of a service that was &lt;strong&gt;designed and intended&lt;/strong&gt; to be used thusly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only describe it as sad that distributed, democratized infrastructure is not just too complex for everyone to run, but that doing so has now been legitimized as cause of suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Internet"></category><category term="elections"></category><category term="media"></category><category term="news"></category><category term="email"></category><category term="server"></category><category term="freedom"></category></entry><entry><title>DVD backups</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/dvd-backups.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-15T20:01:40+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-15:articles/dvd-backups.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finished backing up about 200 DVD disks to a drive, most of which are about 10 years old. Took me about 10 days and 1.5TB of space. I just copied data as it was the quickest and doesn't lose any information. Drive may complain and require change of a DVD region, but once they are copied, computer doesn't care anymore. Glad this part is over now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them needed cleaning, but I really had problems only with three, two of which remains not copied. As it happens it is also one of those on which I can find no visible scratch whatsoever. It used to work, because I've seen it. It does make you wonder what life span of disks really is, even when they were professionally produced. If you have any, I heartily recommend making a backup of them on some other medium. Unless of course they themselves are a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping disks regularly for 10 days does make you notice their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, especially hubs that keep disks in place with varying degrees of zeal. It is astonishing how many designs have been used over years and how few of them are actually pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown of teeth is probably the worst. Like a pitbull unwilling to release a disk until it is visibly bended or a tooth broken. Unless case is made of hard plastic there is really no excuse for using this design. Or any other "pluck" hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank god there are patents (as there always are) to prevent everyone converging to those few "push-to-release" that are actually nice to use. How could I after all value my life appropriately without it being spiced with needless hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I intend to process them into a different, smaller formats that require less space and are easier to (re)use. I am not in a hurry as this step still seems laborious and may also result in some content being lost. I am also thinking of making an additional copy together with file hashes so I could, in principle, recover if any of files gets corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: processing our CD collection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="backup"></category><category term="dvd"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="movies"></category><category term="ownership"></category></entry><entry><title>Long vacations</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/long-vacations.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-02T15:37:18+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-02:articles/long-vacations.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="vacation"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="benefits"></category><category term="rest"></category><category term="test"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-02T15:17:24+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-07-02:articles/windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got a new &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/"&gt;travel computer&lt;/a&gt; this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt; for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually &lt;em&gt;the best Windows&lt;/em&gt; so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="experience"></category><category term="windows10"></category><category term="window"></category><category term="ux"></category><category term="notebook"></category><category term="laptop"></category><category term="asus"></category><category term="zenbook"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2015</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-01-04T13:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-01-04:articles/books-i-read-in-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;2015 was a year of completely &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;missed plans&lt;/a&gt; and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: &lt;em&gt;Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://diytoolkit.org/"&gt;DIY Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/"&gt;Missing Person&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Modiano.&lt;/strong&gt; The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/"&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/"&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt; by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/"&gt;The Shepherd's Crown&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/"&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf.&lt;/strong&gt; A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058"&gt;Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in its last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent about a third of last year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin, confirmed that I am indeed in no way an equestrian person and culminating in my first visit to a doctor on my travels. Not only did I not "salvage summer" as &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I hoped&lt;/a&gt;, I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some decidedly less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family spent a lot of time in hospitals and I with them. Any time is really too much, but at least I can solace myself with good outcomes. Still, it would be great if none of us entered one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go through the list of things &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I planned&lt;/a&gt; a year ago as I did none of them. Life intervened, but I also did not use first half of the year as well as I should. However last couple of months were great. Reader still lives only in my head, but I did finally rewrite image-diet which is now called &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; and is in pretty much everything better than previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and by the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year). I do plan to deepen my knowledge of Python3, ES2015 and ES2016 now that I have more opportunity to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tumultuous year and yet I feel calmer than ever which I mostly attribute to &lt;a href="http://www.tm.org/"&gt;TM&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to judge its other effects on me as they are clearly not as pronounced, but feeling more peaceful even under stressful circumstances makes meditating worthwhile enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to expect of 2016, but it feels seminal. The image stuck in my head for last couple of days was my first week at university. Totally clueless and wrong about where  life will take me, but knowing it will be different afterwards. In a way this year feels like one of last opportunities to &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt; redefine who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest change next year will be professional. I have happily worked for Aptivate for four years and hope to continue doing so in the future, but not solely. I will be available for freelance work. &lt;a href="mailto:markos@gaivo.net"&gt;Talk to me&lt;/a&gt; if you will need help from someone with &lt;a href="http://si.linkedin.com/in/markosamastur"&gt;my background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal for this year is to present a talk at a conference as I haven't done that in a while. "Competition" for slots at interesting ones is strong enough that giving even one will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that I am trying too avoid being too ambitious with my plans as I expect this year to be busy as it is. I plan to do a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter and read more than I did this year. I will write publicly more as it would be difficult to write less and I am again not bereft of things to share (although most of them are not ready yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/vim-notebook"&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; hacked &lt;a href="http://bitterjug.com/"&gt;Mark's&lt;/a&gt; journal script to fit my needs. I can now summon it at any time and commit new entry without switching applications. My plan is mainly to jot down non-obvious problems and solutions I encounter, but I'd love to hear what others write in their work journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending few hours each month on tooling seems sensible. I have rejigged my set up late last year and difference is palpable. Development takes less effort with better results. Removing friction from doing the right thing is already a win, but if I can make it easier than doing wrong things, then that's golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case I have few firm plans for next year. Getting freelancing off the ground and presenting at conference should keep me busy enough. I expect to be overworked at least some of the time and yet it's been a while since I have felt so optimistic. Let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="2015"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Homeconf</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-12-18T18:40:04+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-12-18:articles/homeconf.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to a bunch of topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only went to two this year. Instead I have collected links to talks I was interested in. However I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. I never get nearly as much out of them as when I listen in a dimly lit conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence I recently tried to replicate conference experience at home. I have downloaded the talks&lt;sup id="sf-homeconf-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1" class="simple-footnote" title="What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download?"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and dedicated a full day to watching them. It was brilliant. I especially liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that I could focus very much as I can at conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line-up perfectly matched my interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when I needed more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However not everything is better and there are aspects I have missed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all interesting talks are publicly available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussions about talks or ideas provoked by talks with other attendees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(ab)using power of pausing talks may interfere with your uptake as it can fragment talk's narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these I miss discussions the most. &lt;a href="http://friedcell.si/"&gt;Fry&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with a cool idea of starting a (video) talk "book club". The idea, which obviously needs a better name, is to meet fortnightly or so and have a discussion around talk everyone agreed to listen beforehand. It seems like a well balanced proposal to me, but I am curious to hear what others think about. Who would be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-homeconf-1"&gt;What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download? &lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Late 2014 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-25T23:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-01-25:articles/late-2014-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining
  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0"&gt;

   Vladislav Surkov
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I
  &lt;a href="40.html"&gt;
   became 40
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1"&gt;
    [1]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
  &lt;strong&gt;
   not
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2"&gt;
    [2]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"&gt;
   quantified self
  &lt;/a&gt;
  movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.
  &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading"&gt;
   Again
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
   mjp
  &lt;/a&gt;
  against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It
  &lt;em&gt;
   is
  &lt;/em&gt;
  something to keep an eye on this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don’t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best:
  &lt;em&gt;
   The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and The Quiet American
  &lt;/em&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smut-Stories-Alan-Bennett/dp/1250003164"&gt;
    Smut: Stories
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Alan Bennett. Sex is rarely as funny as in this two stories, but the second story kind of peters out as if the author ran out of ideas to resolve the twisted mess.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253/"&gt;
    Developing Backbone.js Applications
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Addy Osmani. A very good, but occasionally slightly dated introduction to framework. Still highly recommended.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Handlebars-js-Gabriel-Manricks/dp/1783282657/"&gt;
    Instant Handlebars.js
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Gabriel Manricks. Cover says it all: short, fast and focused examination of Handlebars.js. Great if you prefer books to online reading.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Backbone-js-Cookbook-Vadim-Mirgorod/dp/1782162720/"&gt;
    Backbone.js Cookbook
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Vadim Mirgorod. A quick dive into Backbone.js best when paired with previous book on the topic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Vagrants-Novel-Yiyun-Li/dp/0812973348"&gt;
     The Vagrants
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Yiyun Li.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can’t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp/dp/1482374811/"&gt;
    Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Jeff Knupp. A short but informative collection of tips on how to write “pythonic” code. The only real downside is book’s price.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Andrew-Miller-ebook/dp/B0052RMN1U/"&gt;
    Pure
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Andrew Miller. Works best when establishing atmosphere of late 18th century Paris and easy engaging read that turned out to be a bit of disappointment for me. I wish author had as much courage as he does talent.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soldiers-Salamis-Javier-Cercas/dp/B00EBGKWB6"&gt;
     Soldiers of Salamis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Javier Cercas.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/"&gt;
    The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024"&gt;
     The Quiet American
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Graham Greene.
   &lt;/strong&gt;
   I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn’t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.
  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish
  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567"&gt;
   GEB
  &lt;/a&gt;
  even if I discover that I don’t like it.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn’t.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now
  &lt;em&gt;
   know
  &lt;/em&gt;
  some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can’t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There’s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don’t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn’t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There’s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won’t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you
  &lt;em&gt;
   can
  &lt;/em&gt;
  do, better. Which is what I am doing now.
 &lt;/p&gt;
