I’m also recording TV and movies I’ve seen and while I’m not sure if there isn’t a whiff of lunacy to the scope of my tracking, it can be useful, especially for multi-seasonal TV content to decide if one should give next season a go when it comes out. I watched a lot of TV and I mean &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. I could despair about time I spent doing it if much of it wasn’t to relieve boredom of indoor exercise, there were better things to do or if I was snobbish about TV watching as such which I am not. However, it does make this post absurdly long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did spend comparatively little time watching movies. Ironically that was because they are longer and it is easier to fit up to an hour long chunks of content into exercise regimen or dying hours of a day. As blasphemous as this is to many directors, maybe I should watch movies in parts next year (except those rare few I still grudgingly see at local cinemas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows and movies I most liked are marked in bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the things that could be watched this year, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9573980/"&gt;Leaving Neverland&lt;/a&gt; had and will have by far the most profound and doubtlessly lasting impact on me and I didn’t even see it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year there are shows on which I disagree with most critics. This year I was most bothered by gushing over Succession, which is well done but forgettable and poor reception of The Morning Show, which deserves more respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was especially impressed by the first episode of &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;, mini series &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; and all seasons of &lt;em&gt;Rectify&lt;/em&gt;. I think they are all masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8463714/"&gt;The ABC Murders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I was at first skeptical about Malkovich playing Poirot, but he did the excellent script by Sarah Phelps full justice. Her changes to original material were substantial and not for Christie or Poirot purists, but have really elevated the material above a light evening entertainment. It is the only Christie adaptation I remember thinking about days after I saw it and could not recommend it enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8002604/"&gt;Camping&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; An odd and occasionally funny outing of mostly unlikeable characters that really goes off the rails in the last episode and makes you question why you bothered watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7230846/"&gt;No Activity&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A US adaptation of an Australian show about two bored coppers on a stake out where nothing much happens. Uneven, but mostly funny enough for light entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1474684/"&gt;Luther&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5).&lt;/em&gt; Luther was always also silly, but Neil Cross really stopped caring. The best I can say about season 5 is that it wasn't season 4 or Hard Sun and I could ignore nonsensical stuff most of the time. Still, no matter what happens to Luther in the future, this is the last one I'll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8010592/"&gt;Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, American Crime Story&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Did not expect to like or be interested in this one, but it was excellent. Versace's murder is used not only to show what happened to the famous designer, but also to explore and explain what led to it and how difficult it was to be gay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6859806/"&gt;Mrs. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Ruth Wilson plays portrays her grandmother in an extraordinary story about consequences of a marriage to a bigamist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5565334/"&gt;Friends from College&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Not well received second season of a show about a group of friends from college (hence title) of questionable character. Obviously not for everyone, but I liked both seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3526078/"&gt;Schitt's Creek&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A sitcom about a family of suddenly impoverished living in a town they own. Funny enough, but I've been told it gets better in later seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/"&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A young woman keeps dying and reliving her birthday party while trying to figure out what is happening. Could easily be a tropey take on popular reliving a day theme, but is absolutely terrific in so many not always obvious ways. A must see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270492/"&gt;Billions&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; I liked first two seasons even with some reservations, but had to stop watching 3rd after 4 parts. Problems with script and to a lesser extent acting just became unbearable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4374208/"&gt;Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; A decent ending to fantastic series that might not have reached previous heights (for good reasons), but that I enjoyed throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/"&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/a&gt; (Seasons 1-3).&lt;/em&gt; Spinoff of The Good Wife with some improvements, but with the same unappealing female acceptance of male transgressions in first season. Gets better in second and completely absurd by the end of the third. For fans of the original series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5014882/"&gt;The Durrels&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Series made after a popular English book. Could not keep interest after 4th episode of the first season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/"&gt;Shetland&lt;/a&gt; (Season 5).&lt;/em&gt; If you are a fan of competently done crime series, Scotland accent and moody landscape, then this is a show for you. I am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770590/"&gt;Amy Schumer Growing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Comedy special for fans of Amy's humour. Not among best, but I laughed plenty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6599482/"&gt;The Romanoffs&lt;/a&gt; (aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Watched only the first episode of this anthology series. Waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183404/"&gt;Rectify&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-4).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Probably the most realistic take on life and life challenges after surviving death row. Profound, engaging and uninterested in cheap thrills. One of the very best TV series ever made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3561180/"&gt;Ófærð (Trapped)&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; I liked the first series a lot and had great expectations for the second. It was fine at first, but script got more ridiculous as it was coming closer to the end. Still beautiful shots of Iceland's landscape, but not much to recommend otherwise for those not exceptionally gullible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5069564/"&gt;John Mulaney Comback Kid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178650/"&gt;The Victim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A short drama series about aftermath of a horrible event, when a boy murdered a younger boy. Thoughtful, provocative and well acted. Not an easy viewing, but very worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8594510/"&gt;Back To Life&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A dark comedy about rebuilding life after 18 years in prison. Moving, funny and, apart from too long prison sentence, believable. Hope there will be a second season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7820906/"&gt;Good Trouble&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Awful, bloody awful. A rare miss from usually reliable source of recommendations. Ditched in the middle of the second episode because we couldn't stand the stupidity of it all anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8064302/"&gt;Dead to Me&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Liked it better than most critics. Would watch another season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/"&gt;Veep&lt;/a&gt; (Season 7).&lt;/em&gt; Last season of a very funny show that had to work very hard not to become a documentary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9169592/"&gt;Wanda Sykes: Not Normal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Like most comedy specials best for fans of the performer which I am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/"&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A short series about the accident and its aftermath. The best HBO series in years and I cannot recommend it (and its official podcast) enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/"&gt;Good Omens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I love the book so I am ill equipped to judge this series, but book's fans should definitely like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5056196/"&gt;Catch-22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Not so much an adaptation as it was inspired by the book. Probably this series can be alright for those who haven't read the book and should NOT be a substitute for reading it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509004/"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; 9th episode is a small gem, but I otherwise could not warm up to this highly regarded series. Maybe it would leave a better, more ground-breaking impression in 2011, but in 2019 its mostly odious characters really don't need this much time and space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5687612/"&gt;Fleabag&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A great follow-up to the excellent first second with the first episode a spectacular Pinter-like comedy drama deserving to be taught in film school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8694364/"&gt;Years and Years&lt;/a&gt; (aborted).&lt;/em&gt; Unexpectedly horrible to the point where we gave up after 2 episodes. Paper thin characters, speechifying, trying to touch so many issues it becomes a pale ideological satire of present. I have no idea how this can be Russell T. Davies' work and why critics like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687642/"&gt;Simon Amstell: Set Free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/"&gt;Mindhunter&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Drama about development of FBI profiling. Second season is as good as the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/"&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1-2).&lt;/em&gt; A comic drama series of Murdoch/Sinclair/Redstone like family. Or as someone described it: HBO Billions. Fine in the first season, but much better in its second. Good, but not as great as described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7909970/"&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A short series based on true events of catching a serial rapist. Excellently executed with respect to everyone involved in original events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8708280/"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A series of 10 minute episodes about a couple with marriage in crisis. Written by Nick Hornby. Opinions about it are divided in our household, but I liked all episodes except last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4370596/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt"&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; Hard to give a good short description of this series that is even more structureless in this 3rd season, but it remains being one of my favourite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9348692/"&gt;Criminal: United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; A police procedural anthology series with 3 well written and played episodes, especially first two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10409666/"&gt;Gary Gulman: The Great Depresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another comedy special with Gary talking about his struggles with depression. Worth seeing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3920596/"&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2).&lt;/em&gt; Not great as the first season, but fine. I do wonder what it would look like if they kept Andrea Arnold's vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986056/"&gt;Criminal: Germany&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Second part was bad, but not unwatchable as Criminal: France, the rest of it was very good with two stellar supporting role performances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3747572/"&gt;Grantchester&lt;/a&gt; (Season 4).&lt;/em&gt; Fourth series of crime drama for fans of sleuthing vicars in post-WWII England. As it ever was, but I've had enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4998350/"&gt;The Deuce&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2-3).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A three season drama about systemic exploitation of women and other marginal groups through prostitution, pornography and government/police indifference and corruption. Not an easy watch, but absolutely worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; (Season 3).&lt;/em&gt; New cast, same family. This time with less affection for people involved, but otherwise much like first two seasons. Meaning still a very good TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4322508/"&gt;Les témoins (Witnesses)&lt;/a&gt; (Season 2, aborted).&lt;/em&gt; First series was great and second is like watching a car crash. I couldn't believe the same people were involved in creating a series that is even worse than the abysmal 3rd season of Line of Duty. Why in the world did I not give up sooner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11163014/"&gt;Mike Birbiglia: The New One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I worship in the church of Birbiglia whose every outing makes me want to become a writer. There is no better storyteller among comedians and his most recent show is no exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9644058/"&gt;The Guilt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A fun to watch comedy crime series with unexpected ending that tests those who like moral or just endings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11168100/"&gt;Seth Meyers: Lobby Baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Funny. I especially liked the part channeling his wife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/"&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1).&lt;/em&gt; Underrated show about TV morning show examining #MeToo revelations and its consequences on all. Less flashy but with more depth than better received Succession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were few real duds this year and a few movies I really liked, but the one that I keep thinking about is &lt;em&gt;Portrait of a lady on fire&lt;/em&gt;. It is rare I see a movie which cannot be moved to a different art form without losing some of its magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075192/"&gt;Manbiki kazoku (Shoplifters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A bittersweet story about a family of misfits trying to survive on margins of Japanese society with help of small crimes and contemplation of what constitutes a family. Not a mood lifter, but one of the best films I've seen in last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/"&gt;The Favourite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Drama often mislabeled as a comedy because of comic bits about life of Queen Anne. Absolutely must see even if you don't care one iota about Anne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6742252/"&gt;Den skyldige (The Guilty)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A Danish thriller about a police dispatcher receiving a distress call with nothing but his phone, wits and police database to go on with to genre befitting twists and turns. Wholly well done and definitely recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6266538/"&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A movie about Dick Cheney's rise to power with an almost distractingly good performance from Christian Bale. Well made and certainly above a typical biography and I enjoyed the movie greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4218572/"&gt;Widows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; More drama than a thriller about a group of robber widows organising a heist. Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn raise the movie above normal genre fare without sacrificing any of the thrills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/"&gt;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Rewatched it after a long time and can still be enjoyable if one can get pass Ferris' obvious psychopathic traits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714886/"&gt;Post Mortem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A movie about a shy Chilean clerk falling in love with his neighbour during 1973 military coup. Good movie, but not an easy watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8169446/"&gt;Wine Country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; An addition to comedy genre of group of friends celebrating birthday on a long weekend trip. Fairly formulaic and mostly for fans of people involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5776858/"&gt;Phantom Thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A well produced and acted character study of broken unpleasant people. It kept my interest for 2 hours, but did not left me with any lingering thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1087890/"&gt;Frygtelig lykkelig (Terribly Happy)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I feel like I've seen this noir thriller before. My wife was disappointed, but I thought it was OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/"&gt;Office Christmas Party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I did not dislike this movie as most seem to even though it can be really ridiculous. Kate McKinnon is a comedic goddess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/"&gt;Booksmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This movie deserves a better trailer. It's a very funny and refreshing take on a known end of high school formula. Certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in recent years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7921248/"&gt;La Gomera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Another wife's disappointment and I can see how Gilda's part can be really grating, but I enjoyed it while watching even though its main idea is ridiculous on the first examination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/"&gt;Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a lady on fire)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Cinema at its finest. There's not a tone played wrongly in this love story and I hope to see it again soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6920356/"&gt;The Souvenir&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Movies do not get better reviews than this one and I have no idea why. I liked Hogg's Archipelago and Souvenir is certainly technically well done, but the story is pedestrian and has been better done too many times before and I couldn't find anything else to get out of this movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8800266/"&gt;Ema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I've seen most Larraín's movies and liked all of them except this one. I got confused by focusing on the wrong thing in a crucial scene, but even with that it shows that parts of the movie were done without script as I found characters rambling off-putting. It's still Larraín's movie so not without merit, but I was still overall disappointed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094606/"&gt;The Accidental Tourist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The kind of movie studios don't really make anymore. A story about life after family tragedy, end of marriage and new hope. Worth seeing.&lt;/li&gt;

So, I have also started jotting down exhibitions, plays and other events we attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes are probably even less useful to any one not me than those about books, but at least some exhibitions can still be seen at the time of writing (permanent collections and around the last fifth of the list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exhibitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we visit on average about ten exhibitions each year. Various circumstances contributed to us seeing almost thirty this year, which will not happen again any time soon. We were lucky and most exhibitions we saw were at least interesting, many good and a few really amazing or even once-in-a-lifetime events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhibitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/monet/"&gt;Claude Monet&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An excellent exhibition which happily did not focus only on Japanese bridge and water lilies. Probably most painting by Monet you could possibly see at one place outside of Marmottan Monet in Paris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/helen-levitt/"&gt;Helen Levitt&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An interesting exhibition of one of the pioneers of street photography. What I found especially intriguing were strips of negatives that allowed visitors to compare selected and unselected pictures and how those presented were sometimes cropped. I probably am not the only person who would make a few different choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/niko-pirosmani/"&gt;Niko Pirosmani&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; A small exhibition of to me unknown Georgian naïve painter who was an important influence on Chagall and Picasso (among others). While I was not enamoured with all presented painting, others made strong impression on me and I would love to see his paintings again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/105/into-the-great-outdoors"&gt;Into the Great Outdoors&lt;/a&gt; (Leopold Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; An exhibition of mostly late 19th century Austrian outdoor painters and paintings. Apart from few exceptions it mostly left me cold and unimpressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/104/klimt-moser-gerstl"&gt;Klimt-Moser-Gerstl&lt;/a&gt; (Leopold Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; I was not familiar with Gerstl who I think would do interesting work if he lived longer. I was also pleasantly surprised by Moser and Klimt part of the exhibition. Unfamiliar works and a new perspective gave me a new appreciation for both artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bruegel2018.at/"&gt;Bruegel&lt;/a&gt; (Kunst Historisches Museum, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; A truly once in a lifetime experience. Seeing 4 out of 5 surviving months of the year paintings next to each other as well as both Towers of Babel were two highlights of a really exceptional presentation of the Flemish master. We could be there for hours more, but with just end of a day tickets available could stay only until we were thrown out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mglc-lj.si/eng/exhibitions_and_events/posters/74"&gt;Milton Glaser, Posters&lt;/a&gt; (MGLC, Ljubljana).&lt;/em&gt; A small exhibition of 35 posters made by Milton Glaser. Wished exhibition was bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/2019-sony-world-photography-awards-exhibition"&gt;Sony World Photography Awards Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (Somerset House, London).&lt;/em&gt; Any awards exhibition will show choices one disagrees with, especially when there are 800. It helps to skip reading often inane descriptions next to them. Still, I overall enjoyed the exhibition and more than I suspect I would the Deutsche Börse one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/diane-arbus-beginning"&gt;Diane Arbus: In The Beginning&lt;/a&gt; (Hayward Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; I am not an admirer of most of her work, but this exhibition really helped me understand her historical importance as so much of modern photography I dislike (and sometimes like) was clearly directly influenced by her work. I feel I'd like it more if my experience wasn't already tainted by her less talented and interesting successors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/don-mccullin"&gt;Don McCullin&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Britain, London).&lt;/em&gt; Having seen so many of his pictures I was still not prepared for this punch in a stomach. Moving, devastating and always humane and needs to be seen even when most uncomfortable. I kept wondering how he managed to survive decades of his work and the answer is he kind of hasn't completely. Echoes of human suffering are still present even in his recent photos of Somerset landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/the-renaissance-nude"&gt;The Renaissance Nude&lt;/a&gt; (Royal Academy of Arts, London).&lt;/em&gt; Wish it was a longer exhibition of development of the nude in 15th and 16th century art. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/cc-land-exhibition-pierre-bonnard-colour-memory"&gt;Pierre Bonnard&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; Some people question if Bonnard was any good. Those people are idiots. His compositions alone, especially those involving people, were innovative, interesting and usually well executed. I care less about his landscapes which are just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dorothea-tanning"&gt;Dorothea Tanning&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; Ashamed to say I did not know her before as her works in  this exhibition blew me away. A feast for the eyes. I find surrealistic art difficult to interpret, but would love to know more about her personal family experiences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/munch.aspx"&gt;Edvard Munch&lt;/a&gt; (British Museum, London).&lt;/em&gt; An exhibition worth seeing on Munch's development as a printmaker with more than 80 prints from Munch and artists that influenced him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://artmuseum.is/exhibitions/johannes-s-kjarval-cant-draw-harebell"&gt;Jóhannes S. Kjarval: Can't Draw a Harebell&lt;/a&gt; (Reykjavik Art Museum, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; Exhibition of "floral" work of one the most important Icelandic painters. Fine, but not the kind of work I enjoy greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.listasafn.is/english/exhibitions/national-treasures"&gt;Treasures of a nation&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery of Iceland, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; An eclectic, often changed, mix of works from various Icelandic artists and the kind of exhibition where everyone can find pieces to enjoy. I certainly did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.listasafn.is/english/exhibitions/hulda-hakon-1-2"&gt;Hulda Hákon: Who are you people?&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery of Iceland, Reykjavik).&lt;/em&gt; A retrospective of to me unknown artist. I am still undecided on artistic merits of her works, but they are certainly engaging and fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gam.comune.verona.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=43329&amp;amp;tt=museo"&gt;Permanent collection&lt;/a&gt; (Galleria d’Arte Moderna Achille Forti , Verona).&lt;/em&gt; Some very nice pieces in a collection of mostly 19th and early 20th century art that was shortened by an underwhelming photo exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=castelvecchio+verona"&gt;Permanent collection&lt;/a&gt; (Museo di Castelvecchio, Verona).&lt;/em&gt; Again, a few very interesting pieces in a collection that requires affinity for sacred art. Worth seeing for the castle and architectural upgrades alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/the-credit-suisse-exhibition-gauguin-portraits"&gt;Gauguin Portraits&lt;/a&gt; (The National Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; While knowing a bit about Gauguin's life beforehand I still did not expect that the main take from this exhibition will be what an absolute swine he was. But not talentless which I think is especially obvious in his later works done outside of France. No shortage of good paintings and some great ones, but the ticket price was still exorbitant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/taylor-wessing-photographic-portrait-prize-2019/exhibition/"&gt;The Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize 2019&lt;/a&gt; (National Portrait Gallery, London).&lt;/em&gt; I thought there were a few very good photo portraits, but overall I found the exhibition disappointing. Most exhibits covered the same few trendy issues in a fairly formulaic way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/expositions/leonardo-da-vinci"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; (Louvre, Paris).&lt;/em&gt; An amazing collection of works that could be presented better (e.g. IR reproductions next to the actual pictures with more guidance). I also missed more contextual information, but it was another must-see once in a lifetime exhibition. Event Vitruvian man showed up with its very own security guard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson"&gt;Olafur Eliasson: In Real Life&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Modern, London).&lt;/em&gt; I was passingly familiar with him before, but now I might have found my favourite contemporary visual artist. A fantastic exhibition of few decades of work clearly inspired by Iceland that was sad, fun, full of wonder and never dull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist"&gt;William Blake&lt;/a&gt; (Tate Britain, London).&lt;/em&gt; I still admire a lot of his works, but this comprehensive look into his whole life and work has also shown Blake could be lazy and mediocre when not interested in work he was hired to do. I wish curators of such exhibitions dared to be more critical, but enormous amount of works, many rarely accessible (such as one of only two existing copies of coloured Jerusalem) presented well, make it a must visit one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year.html"&gt;Wildlife Photographer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; (Natural History Museum, London).&lt;/em&gt; A now annual visit to enjoy recent works and find amusement in often questionable background descriptions. Astonishing how much better wildlife photos got in just the last decade. I never fully agree with judges’ decisions, but there were few if any real misses this year and I'm glad we saw it. Still find it odd that exhibition merchandise is also made out of photos that didn't even qualify for the exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_bermondsey_2019"&gt;Anselm Kiefer Superstrings, Runes, The Norns, Gordian Knot&lt;/a&gt; (White Cube, London).&lt;/em&gt; 80% of modern art is garbage, but Kiefer's certainly isn't. Kiefer is not a happy optimist and exhibited works can be almost literally (physically) overwhelming. They are views into sins past and present, but visually compelling, even beautiful and I could not look away. I liked superstrings series the least, but still a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/albrecht-duerer/"&gt;Albrecht Dürer&lt;/a&gt; (Albertina, Vienna).&lt;/em&gt; I was familiar with Dürer's print work and knew Albertina has an amazing collection, but this exhibition was nevertheless a revelation of his talent and skill. He could do pretty much anything and his watercolour paintings are breathtaking. As usual team at Albetina excels at contextualising and explaining his work (unlike say Louvre) and hours just flew by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plays are something I only see in London because we visit it most often. I am rarely really disappointed even though or maybe because UK theatre seems less experimental than our own. Wish I wasn’t so (unreasonably?) annoyed by Slovenian acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, performances we saw this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pinteratthepinter.com/the-plays/betrayal"&gt;Betrayal&lt;/a&gt; by Harold Pinter (Harold Pinter Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; A play about infidelity and its disastrous consequences told in reverse chronological order. Wonderfully acted by all and especially Tom Hiddleston.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/three-sisters/8-apr-2020-25-may-2019"&gt;Three sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Anton Chekhov (Almeida Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; Not as good as &lt;em&gt;Summer and Smoke&lt;/em&gt; was by the same team and difficult to enjoy when you are repeatedly reminded of unpleasant recent events, but nevertheless a good show solidly acted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thepiccadillytheatre.com/death-of-a-salesman"&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/a&gt; by Arthur Miller (The Piccadilly Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; A phenomenal production and performance by Wendell Pierce, Sharon D. Clarke and the rest of the cast with many in audience moved to tears. Felt privileged to see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/translations"&gt;Translations&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Friel (National Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; Irish accent made this more difficult to follow and I would love to read the play, but it was unquestionably a moving and thought-provoking examination of language, communication and cultural imperialism. Splendidly performed by everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.garricktheatre.org/noises-off/"&gt;Noises Off&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Frayn (Garrick Theatre, London).&lt;/em&gt; I rarely enjoy farces, but this one was hilarious. I haven’t laughed so much in a while. Cleverly structured in 3 parts, each building on previous, is funny almost without a pause and performed without a fault and exceptional timing by a great cast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rarely go to concerts anymore as they are simply too loud and crowded for me to enjoy, but we happened to stumble upon Bach’s St. John Passion performed at St. Martin in the Fields church while we were in London for Easter, which promised to be neither. I always had difficulty understanding sung words in any language, but especially German. Nevertheless, the performance was beautiful and while I wasn't too keen on Stephen Anthony Brown's evangelist take, it was certainly done well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="culture"></category><category term="exhibition"></category><category term="theatre"></category><category term="concert"></category><category term="2019"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>Travel articles and gear</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/travel-and-gear.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-30T12:19:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-05-30T12:19:00+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-05-30:/articles/travel-and-gear.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We like to travel, but I avoid reading travel pieces unless we are researching for an upcoming trip as we currently are.

Too much of this semi-fictional genre is snobbishly prescriptive or laughably overconfident (and sometimes both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most annoying example of former is almost a sub-genre of writing describing the right way to travel while scolding “detractors” where right usually means backpacking for months with a small backpack and on cheap trying to meet locals. I find it especially annoying because not only do we not all travel for the same reasons, for most of us how we travel is a compromise between our wishes and abilities including available time and money. What every traveller should strive for is to minimise their negative impact on environment and visited cultures and apart from cruises there are few travel approaches that I would describe as a priori wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other grating notion is the idea that spending a few months in a foreign society will result in your understanding of it. This is not true even if you are an anthropologist. More exposure rarely hurts, but I wish more people stayed humble in their interpretations of observed events. I understand English pretty well, have spent cumulatively almost two years in England, have friends there and have spent decades consuming British culture through media, books, TV, movies and music. An investment I am unlikely to be able to repeat with any culture and yet I am still not completely fluent in it. There are bits I don’t understand and frankly not all British do either as is likewise true for me and Slovenian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I find an interesting advice or insight can salvage almost anything. With this hope, here’s mine. Try watching local TV at least a bit during your travels, especially commercials. I find advertisement provides a skewed, but interesting lens on how society wants to see itself and what it finds important and profitable. Also, asking for opinions instead of facts is more likely to elicit richer answers and repeating previously answered questions to newly met people can be illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Photo) gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I read articles about travel rarely except when doing research, which mostly is looking for information about specific locations and travel gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we’ve developed check lists for all types of trips we do and got pretty good at packing, but the need to tweak our gear never goes away if for no other reason to replace worn out stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few items I am almost obsessed about. Backpacks are one of them. Their designs have immensely improved over the years and I have also accepted that we need several, but I think philosophical differences between me, and backpack designers make it unlikely I will find a perfect one for multi-day treks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trekking trousers are another. Men trousers are usually serviceable, but women’s are generally awful because of creators seemingly almost phobic fear of external pockets. If one needs to wear a jacket or take off their backpack to have access to a map or one’s phone, then they are not fit for use and most aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since we are both keen photographers, I especially try to optimise photo equipment we lug around. Last decade brought a lot of changes to gear I see used on our trips. Most casual shooters have switched to using smartphones and mirrorless cameras are replacing DSLRs among photo enthusiasts although later group may carry as much as it used to since new space and weight are now often taken by drones. Everyone uses whatever device makes desired shot the easiest (e.g.  wide panoramas tend to be taken with smartphones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trips usually include up to a weeklong off grid treks. It took me way too long to figure out that the best way to handle those is carry a high-capacity power bank and making sure every electrical device can be powered through USB connection. This makes everything easier also when we are back as it reduces number of cables, is generally easier to fix if something goes wrong and reduces the need to find free electrical sockets. We don’t use solar cells because they would rarely if ever be practical to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last trip I tried to see how well I can do with smartphone as my only camera. Generally, I was pleased with &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157673205196187"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157703189184404"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; but found phone’s lack of zoom too limiting. Which is why I have switched to iPhone X with its 2x optical zoom. Still, while better than before this is often not enough and cannot be compensated with cropping because significant crop of a 12M image does not leave many pixels even when change of perspective is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems new phones will add even wider lenses that are fairly useless to me as stitched panoramas are excellent and have better resolutions. I have experimented with switchable lenses from &lt;a href="https://shiftcam.com/"&gt;ShiftCam&lt;/a&gt;. I still love their design, but lenses themselves are of poor quality, a problem also plaguing their competitors based on published online images. Would gladly pay more for an easy to use quality zoom lens if I could find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, apps available for tweaking photos are often phenomenal. As an iOS user I mostly rely on built-in tools, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/skrwt/id834248867"&gt;SKRWT&lt;/a&gt; for perspective corrections and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/touchretouch/id373311252"&gt;TouchRetouch&lt;/a&gt; for removing unwanted items. It can feel almost magical how easy it can be to shape up a photo. I am sure equivalent tools exist also on Android platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the technical quality of these photos is still noticeably worse than those taken by our Nikon so we will continue carrying all that stuff. If only I could now find a compact travel tripod that would be easier to attach to our backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category><category term="gear"></category><category term="photo"></category><category term="photography"></category><category term="phones"></category></entry><entry><title>2018 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2018-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-14T21:38:05+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-14T21:38:05+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-01-14:/articles/2018-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just reread &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2017-review.html"&gt;my last year review&lt;/a&gt; and could copy first two paragraphs with few changes.

&lt;p&gt;Without wish or intent to go into much detail, this was a year in which …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just reread &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2017-review.html"&gt;my last year review&lt;/a&gt; and could copy first two paragraphs with few changes. I am still fine, loved ones less so and there were new horrific organisational experiences to replace old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without wish or intent to go into much detail, this was a year in which our home had to be listed as a no-go location in a restraining order and I observed Slovenian police and justice system dealing with credible threats to life and continue failing miserably to this day. Not all failures come down to sex, but being a woman certainly seems to make things worse for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I ended last year in a much better mood than I started or was for much of the year. No doubt visiting &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157703189184404"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157673205196187"&gt;Réunion&lt;/a&gt;, while physically taxing, helped a lot. As did summer visit from friends, hiking more than ever, building Legos and working on a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently a British minister &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/culture-secretary-jeremy-wright-reveals-his-love-of-lego"&gt;was ridiculed&lt;/a&gt; for playing with Lego sets, but I can only recommend it, especially to those under stress. Calming effect of putting bricks together and satisfaction of building something is truly relaxing. I don’t know what I might do this year, but last year I build Taj Mahal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Taj Mahal" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1752/41908286734_e18c334767_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I would also like to build something more useful and less tactile. I made prototypes to test the idea of an email Instapaper at the end of last year and hope to get it running some time this year, if I can resolve problems around financially tolerable and reliable email delivery. It might even lead to some fresh content on this website if I write up an idea or two after I test it with this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I did &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html"&gt;not read much&lt;/a&gt;, but we hiked often which really paid off in Réunion where a bout of dengue led me to carrying heavier than expected backpack for days at end. Possibly was the fittest I’ve ever been and if I could get into the same shape this year while improving my diet and losing some weight, then that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main goal last year was to take care of loved ones. I cannot remember why I felt it necessary to state this as it is, will be and should be most important thing I do every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to give myself a pass again for not doing much else. I felt getting stupider this year, which was a wholly unenjoyable experience. 2019 is the year of my new, less flattering demographic age bracket, but I will not be remotely old enough that dulling of intellect would be expected or acceptable. I suspect this “development” had a lot do with what and how much I read last year and I will focus my efforts there to expand my general knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of learning, I did not make much progress with Spanish last year and won’t first few months of this year either. At some point (spring?) I’ll have to if I don’t want to forget what I already learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans for 2019 are unintentionally vague so there is a good chance that I could in some sense fulfil more than usual including another long trip abroad. There is one thing I want to change from 2018 and that is just being more intentional in whatever I will do. Nothing seems to make time feel wasted so reliably than spending it without a forethought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2018"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2018</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-01T22:50:30+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-01T22:50:30+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2019-01-01:/articles/books-i-read-in-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;…were too few.

Even worse than 2016 from which I lifted this post’s beginning. At least none of them were duds. All of them are worth reading, but I reserved bold for those that are not too niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links lead to Smile Amazon. I still get nothing from referrals, but at least some charity might get few cents instead of also nothing. Brodeck Report is lacking a link because graphic novel has not been translated to English yet. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Magic-Watches-Smart-Introduction-Watchmaking/dp/2940506124/"&gt;The Magic of Watches&lt;/a&gt; by Louis Nardin. A very fine introduction to the world of (wrist)watches and one of the best designed books I own. A very good introduction for already interested that is at its weakest when it is trying to sell you this hobby, but more than makes up for it elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Platero-Spanish-Juan-Ramon-Jim%C3%A9nez/dp/9706665641/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8"&gt;Platero y Yo&lt;/a&gt; by Juan Ramon Jiménez&lt;/strong&gt;. Bittersweet stories about author's friendship with a donkey. Above my Spanish level and will have to read it again some day. Lovely prose where my understanding was not too foggy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brodeckovo poročilo (Brodeck Report) by Manu Larcenet&lt;/strong&gt;. A fantastic graphic novel based on a novel by Philippe Claudel about difference and intolerance in a village near French-German border soon after WW2. Wonderfully drawn and impactful, it would be difficult to imagine it is not doing justice to original material which I have not read yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Architecting-Angular-Applications-Redux-RxJS/dp/1787122409/"&gt;Architecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJS, and NgRx&lt;/a&gt; by Christoffer Noring. I have mixed feelings about this book. It is a good introduction to the topic, but I am still not persuaded about the approach. I have some qualms about organisation of the content as the book seems to be confused about who its audience is and certainly about many technical mistakes in code samples, but I would still recommend it as the best introduction to those who need to get acquainted with its topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mistletoe-Murder-Other-Stories/dp/1101973803/"&gt;The Mistletoe Murder and Other Stories&lt;/a&gt; by P.D. James&lt;/strong&gt;. Judging by this book P.D. James deserved her high reputation. Crime stories best read around Christmas, all of them superbly conceived and written. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan for this year is simply to get into a habit of reading books again with a healthy mixture of fiction and non-fiction. No particular number in mind, but single digit would be disappointing as it would mean I again wasted too much stuff on mostly short fluff found on the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great, if I managed to rise to last year’s challenge of reading a book in each to me  familiar language, but probably won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

It is: “My wife had an absolutely awful year so mine wasn’t good either.” It turned out that my last year’s &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2016-review.html"&gt;gloomy prediction&lt;/a&gt; was still optimistic. 2017 was full of accidents, family tragedy, acts and behaviour that could really nurture one’s misanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep such tendencies in check with an exception reserved for &lt;a href="https://www.kclj.si/index.php?dir=/pacienti_in_obiskovalci/klinike_in_oddelki/stomatoloska_klinika"&gt;the most dysfunctional organisation&lt;/a&gt; I know of. Their every medical report was full of lies and when I think of them I only feel loathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 has inherited everything needed to be another bad year and my only real goal for this year is to try to make it passable. Take care of loved ones. Everything else will be delegated to modest hopes and ambitions without firm commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger ambitions in 2017 were sunk in a stream of events that taught me at the very least that there are different kinds of lost years. I wouldn’t change anything if I had to relive this one so at least regrets were not compounded. Well, almost. Profound sadness from the start of 2017 developed into anger that certainly exhibited itself in my crankiness. For this I am very sorry. Otherwise I am fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 really proved how important it is to take care of your health and I did it with mixed results. On one hand I continued to meditate and averaged almost 50 minutes of recreation per day. I also got noticeably overweight and certainly not from a well balanced diet. I do not feel too bad about this, considering the year, as I am prone to comfort eating, but I would prefer a year with only half as much exercise if I also fixed my weight and diet. Also, long term stress &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I haven’t done any homeconfs, nor did I build anything new nor find a new hobby. I was too preoccupied with problems at home to indulge in a quest for bigger problems to solve. My Spanish definitely stagnated which is something I definitely want to change this year. I would love to scrape together enough time for at least some of the listed wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this year eases on character-building experiences, then I’d like to give my learning more direction and depth. Spend less time on things that become quickly obsolete if they are not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published here rarely because I wrote rarely. What I did write reads clunky and awkward and more practice is sorely needed. It would be almost impossible to publish less than I did last year, but another such year might help if it unshackles me from a self-imposed expectation of finishing the things I started. Curious to see how this turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking of it, 2018 looks like a maintenance year. By which I don’t mean to forsake anything new, but my focus will definitely be on solving existing issues instead of creating new ones. Let’s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2017</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-01T13:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T13:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2018-01-01:/articles/books-i-read-in-2017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cannot say much good about 2017, but at least I read a bunch of books.

More even than I hoped and fewer than I would if I hadn’t slacked off at the end of last year. Not a bad selection either with no duds, but maybe too many work oriented choices and overall intellectually somewhat shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every year unaffiliated links point to Amazon. They represent mild endorsement and I would also include the two unlinked ones if I could find a place where you can get them online. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them and translations or originals may be worse or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bold, as always, is reserved for those I would recommend: &lt;em&gt;Austerlitz, Stories of Your Life And Others&lt;/em&gt;, a sequel &lt;em&gt;The Arab of the Future 2, Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; and a non-fiction book &lt;em&gt;The Mom Test&lt;/em&gt;. Of these I would recommend Austerlitz the most even though I am certain it will not be to everyone’s liking. The second book worthy of a special mention is The Mom Test which I believe is the first exception to my unstated policy (until now) of recommending only fiction and general interest non-fiction books. Even if you are not trying to start a business it is still useful to learn how to get useful information and feedback from people without resorting to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mohorjeva.com/knjige_buecher/detajl/judje-na-slovenskem"&gt;Judje na Slovenskem (Jews in Slovenian ethnic territory)&lt;/a&gt; by Klemen Jelinčič Boeta. A very short, at time enumerative but always informative history of Jews in Slovenian territories. I became nauseous when reading about 19th and most of 20th century, but would recommend it even more for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0989387003/"&gt;How to Improve Your Foreign Language Immediately&lt;/a&gt; by Boris Shekhtman. A very to the point book on techniques you can use to improve how you learn (any) new language. Too early  to tell how well they work, but they and exercises look promising and useful also for improving communication in native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microinteractions-Full-Color-Designing-Details/dp/1491945923"&gt;Microinteractions: Designing with Details&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Saffer. Detailed examination of microinteractions, what makes them work and how to use them to build experiences that are pleasant and memorable. Recommended reading for UX designers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Austerlitz-W-G-Sebald/dp/0375504834"&gt;Austerlitz&lt;/a&gt; by W.G.Sebald&lt;/strong&gt;. I am struggling to describe this very fine book without saying too much while saying too little. Almost dreamlike, impressionistic meditation where a lot transpires without much happening. Very recommended and worth persisting even if it does not grab you immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mobile-App-Development-Ionic-Cross-Platform/dp/1491937785/"&gt;Mobile App Development with Ionic 2&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Griffith. A good introduction to Ionic2 for those new to it. I would like it more if it was more focused (comments related to Ionic 1 are not really useful to anyone) and if testing apps received more space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374117268/"&gt;A Burglar's Guide to the City&lt;/a&gt; by Geoff Manaugh. A book most easily enjoyed if approached as light entertainment. Starting from an intriguing premise, full of interesting anecdotes and some interesting information, it still felt too long with too little to say. Do not expect a guide!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1101972122"&gt;Stories Of Your Life And Others&lt;/a&gt; by Ted Chiang&lt;/strong&gt;. I feel I should have liked it more than I did. Every story is original and thought provoking, most of them well written and none badly. Cannot think of a reason why I would not recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Longest-Afternoon-Decided-Battle-Waterloo/dp/0465064825"&gt;The Longest Afternoon: The 400 Men Who Decided the Battle of Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; by Brendan Simms. Title really sums it up and I can recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the battle of Waterloo. Gripping read that takes no longer than your average movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1984-1985-Graphic/dp/1627793518"&gt;The Arab of the Future 2: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1984-1985&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf&lt;/strong&gt;. Next instalment in trilogy and as good as the first one. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fever-Dream-Novel-Samanta-Schweblin/dp/0399184597"&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/a&gt; by Samanta Schweblin&lt;/strong&gt;. A difficult book to discuss without saying too much, but it is one of the most gripping books I remember reading. Probably unfilmable, but stories don't come much better than this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nemška loterija (German Lottery) by Miha Mazzini. I enjoyed reading this book more than his recent columns (rants). While twist itself will not surprise you, it is well written with some ideas that may elevate it above most summer reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angular-Cookbook-Second-Matt-Frisbie/dp/1785881922/"&gt;Angular 2 Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Matt Frisbie. An excellent combination of tips and introduction to Angular 2+ that I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn this framework. It has few minor errors, but none (yet) that would really matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Solutions-Everyday-Problems/dp/1449372635/"&gt;CSS Secrets: Better Solutions to Everyday Problems&lt;/a&gt; by Lea Verou. Fantastic book for practically every web frontend developer. At its most superficial it is a well organised cookbook of mostly excellent solutions to commonly found problems. However its real value lies in author's explanations which can teach almost everyone something on how to go about solving CSS challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-SVG-Chris-Coyier/dp/193755743X"&gt;Practical SVG&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Coyier. A fine introduction to using SVG effectively. If like me you want information about SVG internals, then this is probably not the book you want. Nevertheless it already has proved useful to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019"&gt;Badass: Making Users Awesome&lt;/a&gt; by Kathy Sierra. I am a big fan of Kathy, but am a bit perplexed by this book. It's central thesis is interesting: building loyalty by focusing on user's development, but I am not sure how widely can this be used and some research it relies on is questionable. Still, if nothing else it gives you good advice on how to effectively improve your own skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CYFY366/"&gt;Emil und die Detektive (Emil and the Detectives)&lt;/a&gt; by Erich Kästner. I read this book first when I was about Emil Tischbein's age and this fun story aged surprisingly well with its humanistic core as relevant now as it was when it was written. Still, best suited for children and those looking for an easy way in to polishing their German.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interface-Animation-Val-Head-ebook/dp/B01J4NKSZA/"&gt;Designing Interface Animation: Meaningful Motion for User Experience&lt;/a&gt; by Val Head. A good primer on why and how to use animation effectively in interface design. It is at its weakest, as this type of books generally are, when discussing how to incorporate it in work processes, but all of it is worth reading and I would especially recommend reading e-book version as it makes it easier to use included links to video demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Family-Trade-Charles-Stross/dp/1427263108"&gt;The Family Trade&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Stross. A book I probably read at a wrong time. A well written engaging story with mostly compelling characters that sometimes exhibit implausible adaptability to circumstances. An abrupt end on account of book's publishing history did not bother me as much as I expected. Stross is clearly a talented storyteller and I suspect I would like this book more if I read it a couple of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742"&gt;The Mom Test&lt;/a&gt; by Rob Fitzpatrick&lt;/strong&gt;. Possibly the best business book I've ever read. Excellent advice on practically every aspect of customer discovery without any fluff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Učna ura ustvarjalnega pisanja (Lessons or creative writing) by Michal Viewegh. A decent entertainment for a short afternoon with some good lines and with an opinion on good literature that I don't subscribe to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year my plan is again to read about 15 books with work related kind being in clear minority, but numbers are not everything and I would be happy even with only 10 mind-stretching ones. I am looking for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_the_Khazars"&gt;Dictionary of the Khazars&lt;/a&gt; (Hazarski rečnik) in Serbian so any tip would be appreciated. Another challenge to myself is to read at least a book in every language I know well enough. I suspect this is ambitious enough for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

As it happens we recently came back from our trip to Sicily where Google Maps was for the first time our primary navigation tool. Results were mixed, but all in all it is a remarkably mediocre product for something that was launched more than a decade ago and its interface contributed a lot to overall impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem with Google Maps is that you can get stuck in an endless loop if you are in an unknown environment. I don't actually know how navigation apps calculate routes, but from my observations and being aware of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem"&gt;shortest path problem&lt;/a&gt; it looks like full optimisation is done only for "nearby" destinations and around edges of routes to more distant ones. If your destination is far enough then it will fall-back to using main roads for most of your journey and god help you if one of them has a recently closed section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving Agrigento late in the evening we kept being rerouted to the same stretch of closed road. We finally "saved" ourselves by selecting an intermediate destination that formed large enough triangle with our final destination that once reached it was unlikely we would be driven back to by then very familiar blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Google obviously can't learn in advance for all roads when they will be closed. But for a company that prides itself on its machine learning/AI chops it could well notice when all these phones it is tracking stop going through some major route. Especially if they fail to take it after they are repeatedly guided through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I bought what was then practically the cheapest Garmin and one of its features I liked a lot was that it showed how fast I was driving and what the current speed limit was. It wasn't perfect as limits change more often than maps and I can understand why a company like Google prefers not to show that, but I still found current velocity useful as it was far more reliable than car's speedometer. In EU indicated speed must be between 100-110% of real one plus an allowance of additional 4km/h at specified test speeds which means you might be going only 80km/h when gauge is telling you 92km/h. Velocity calculated from averaged GPS positions is simply more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fast driver and I would not care much about this indicator if I could rely more on arrival time estimates. I clearly am not the kind of driver Google expects. This is most obvious on highways where I would need to drive close to speed limit to meet them and I can't because there is no reliable way to know how fast we are going. On most of our trips there simply are not enough mountain ascents to compensate for those "lost" minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally Google Maps assumes options would only unduly burden our feeble minds so it either hides or completely removes them. There are often no alternatives to routes and certainly not once one is selected. The only possible reason to use navigation, it seems, is to get to your destination as quickly as possible and prepare to suffer trying to persuade the app to take a less direct scenic road. When you get to your destination, it will consider its job done and without confirmation stop navigating even if you haven't actually spotted it yet or will need to park somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its limited flexibility and customisability can be infuriating. You don't like the voice used in navigation? Change system wide language settings. Is it too chatty? Turn off or put up. Would you like to go to a previously entered destination? Can't do if you don't also store this information on Google's servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Google Maps was launched, it had a very vivid palette which was later watered down to more pleasingly looking pastels that are also harder to discern, especially in non-ideal conditions such as on a phone in a car on a very sunny day. Most of the time it is fine, but night colours are just obtuse. Who thought that grey, blue and black form a high enough contrast in context where I can reasonably afford only glances at a relatively small screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of night-time colour palette. Why does it switch on immediately after sunset? My phone is more than happy to adjust screen brightness based on brightness of its surrounding, so why does it not use that same sensor to decide when it is actually dark enough to switch colours? Of course you can't change colours either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way it feels petty to spend so many words complaining about something which in its essence I still find remarkable. The fact that you can navigate your way around this planet using a small, relatively affordable gadget with often current traffic updates is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not singular and has not been even before Google Maps was launched. While it is adding new things it is failing many common, if not basic, requirements that were implemented by its less moneyed competitors years ago. Many of these limitations are clearly self-serving. For example there really is no good technical reason for not storing locally previously visited locations. Its offline mode is also limited both in maximum covered area size and (complete?) lack of navigation features. Feasibility of both has, again, been amply demonstrated years ago by others on much more constrained devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constraints are also not financial as implementing and supporting these features on a couple of platforms pales in comparison with resources needed to continuously map and photograph this planet. They are not there because they would be expensive. They are missing because what Google wants is a paternalistic relationship where you regularly feed the beast with new data. And you do that by being tethered to their servers, storing on them even information that doesn't need to be there and responding positively to almost constant nagging to provide pictures of your current location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few products achieve perfection. Most have to settle on a compromise between what is currently feasible, desired by users and required by company. Judging them by some unattainable ideal would be absurd, but Google Maps, while doubtlessly useful, still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="google maps"></category><category term="app"></category><category term="critique"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>2016 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2016-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-29T12:15:52+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T12:15:52+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-29:/articles/2016-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/1779/"&gt;&lt;img alt="XKCD comic: 2017" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2017.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; seminal, but for wrong reasons and I will think twice next time I feel optimistic. The most positive thing I can think of about 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning and text  editor wiped out most of the early version of this review which is one of the reasons why it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not contribute to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae. Since I seem to be mostly fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of the excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest personal change last year was freelancing again full time, which at times felt all consuming. It was a medium success. I am not in danger of being hungry, am working on things I find interesting and have learned a lot including that I don't like the "traditional" model of freelancing with many, relatively short engagements. Instead I prefer to work on longer lasting projects with at most two clients at a time which is what I am doing now. I am not sure if this could still be adequately described as freelancing or consulting, but it certainly does not feel like employment either. Finding correct label will probably wait until I have a need for one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side I learned how I work best by failing some of my clients for which I still feel guilty and ashamed. Another problem is answering what do I do. For example I spend a lot of time last year improving my &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; related skills, but effectively did not use them professionally and this year is shaping to be similar. There is a saying that you are in whatever business your customers think you are in. Clearly theirs and my perception were not aligned and it would be nice if this year I succeeded in answering at least who gets to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly freelancing also changed my perception of time which I never felt I have an abundance of. I can't tell how much of a book I will read in an hour or how many useful lines of code will be produced, so wasting it just gives me some vague feeling of loss. However because money is fungible, charging for time makes such loses more comparable to some things I care about (and admittedly to neither of my examples). It probably is a form of greed even though me getting something is rarely what it ends up being compared to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a trap which somewhat paradoxically becomes worse if you raise your rate. I have colleagues who have difficulty taking time off because they now know almost exactly how much that would cost them. But it can also be useful if turned into a question if what I am doing right now is the most appropriate use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I set a goal of giving at least one talk in 2016. I did 4, most of them on the same topic and while I enjoyed presenting, I do not expect to do it in 2017. Neither will I be setting development goals for this year even as I am expecting to learn a lot. In 2016 I learned 4 different Javascript frameworks because of work and I expect what I do to guide most of what I learn this year as well. Open source work will likely suffer too, but I plan to continue being involved in organising local Javascript events which I started to do at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion of the general state of journalism sank to a new low last year, but there are exceptions and I was happy to be involved with &lt;a href="https://podcrto.si"&gt;Pod črto&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this year I am trying to reduce my obligations and ambitions, it would be great if I could do more work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more, but mostly not the kind of things I had in mind when I set that goal. Hopefully this year will be better including keeping the old promise of having a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to find time for a new hobby. Something that is fun to do even when you have only minutes to spare, is not computer related and is hopefully more tactile, like building with Legos that I already have. Also spend more effort learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still all this is is just tweaking life as it passes. Last year and especially last few months of it, as I observed world with increasing horror, I kept thinking what the right response should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it isn't doing nothing. There are no problems needing me to be solved, but even my own experience proves that getting involved can matter. Life fully lived is more than just a pursuit of personal comfort and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; once said that you should always ask yourself what is the most important problem that needs solving and how you can contribute most. I feel stuck responding to his two part challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, identifying the most important problem to work on, suffers from abundance of choice. Climate change with all its consequences, EU project continuing viability, rise of (rightwing) populism etc. Right now I am pretty much unqualified to meaningfully help with any of them, but I do feel slightly more qualified about an issue that connects them all which is the role of modern media and the way (mis)information spreads. As this post is already tryingly long, I won't go &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f00ec8cdfcb#.uipgk19ru"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/12/eleven-tweets.html#more"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/facebooks-walled-wonderland-is-inherently-incompatible-with-news-media-b145e2d0078c#.ddp42t5wu"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-americans-against-trump-can-learn-from-the-failures-of-the-israeli-opposition?intcid=mod-latest"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2955021/shirtless-trump-saves-drowning-kitten/#pq=VD83C8"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which does not make choosing ways to get involved easier. Writing code is unlikely to be helpful if you are not a part of the teams working on platforms that matter (Facebook, Twitter) and I never will be. Even if I were, ideas currently discussed are unlikely to be effective or can be just as easily abused to make things worse. There might be space for activism. Having done it before, I know how difficult it can be and how temperamentally unsuited I am for it. Before I worry too much about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to achieve my goals, I need to establish &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't feel much certainty at the moment, but what I am certain of is that the idea of "Reader", that kept cropping up on this site, is dead. I would still love to have such tool, but last year thoroughly proved it is at best a solution to a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry></feed>
