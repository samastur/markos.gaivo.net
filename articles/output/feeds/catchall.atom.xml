&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/2015-review.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; seminal, but for wrong reasons and I will think twice next time I feel optimistic. The most positive thing I can think of about 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning and text  editor wiped out most of the early version of this review which is one of the reasons why it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not contribute to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae. Since I seem to be mostly fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of the excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest personal change last year was freelancing again full time, which at times felt all consuming. It was a medium success. I am not in danger of being hungry, am working on things I find interesting and have learned a lot including that I don't like the "traditional" model of freelancing with many, relatively short engagements. Instead I prefer to work on longer lasting projects with at most two clients at a time which is what I am doing now. I am not sure if this could still be adequately described as freelancing or consulting, but it certainly does not feel like employment either. Finding correct label will probably wait until I have a need for one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side I learned how I work best by failing some of my clients for which I still feel guilty and ashamed. Another problem is answering what do I do. For example I spend a lot of time last year improving my &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; related skills, but effectively did not use them professionally and this year is shaping to be similar. There is a saying that you are in whatever business your customers think you are in. Clearly theirs and my perception were not aligned and it would be nice if this year I succeeded in answering at least who gets to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly freelancing also changed my perception of time which I never felt I have an abundance of. I can't tell how much of a book I will read in an hour or how many useful lines of code will be produced, so wasting it just gives me some vague feeling of loss. However because money is fungible, charging for time makes such loses more comparable to some things I care about (and admittedly to neither of my examples). It probably is a form of greed even though me getting something is rarely what it ends up being compared to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a trap which somewhat paradoxically becomes worse if you raise your rate. I have colleagues who have difficulty taking time off because they now know almost exactly how much that would cost them. But it can also be useful if turned into a question if what I am doing right now is the most appropriate use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I set a goal of giving at least one talk in 2016. I did 4, most of them on the same topic and while I enjoyed presenting, I do not expect to do it in 2017. Neither will I be setting development goals for this year even as I am expecting to learn a lot. In 2016 I learned 4 different Javascript frameworks because of work and I expect what I do to guide most of what I learn this year as well. Open source work will likely suffer too, but I plan to continue being involved in organising local Javascript events which I started to do at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion of the general state of journalism sank to a new low last year, but there are exceptions and I was happy to be involved with &lt;a href="https://podcrto.si"&gt;Pod črto&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this year I am trying to reduce my obligations and ambitions, it would be great if I could do more work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more, but mostly not the kind of things I had in mind when I set that goal. Hopefully this year will be better including keeping the old promise of having a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to find time for a new hobby. Something that is fun to do even when you have only minutes to spare, is not computer related and is hopefully more tactile, like building with Legos that I already have. Also spend more effort learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still all this is is just tweaking life as it passes. Last year and especially last few months of it, as I observed world with increasing horror, I kept thinking what the right response should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it isn't doing nothing. There are no problems needing me to be solved, but even my own experience proves that getting involved can matter. Life fully lived is more than just a pursuit of personal comfort and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; once said that you should always ask yourself what is the most important problem that needs solving and how you can contribute most. I feel stuck responding to his two part challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, identifying the most important problem to work on, suffers from abundance of choice. Climate change with all its consequences, EU project continuing viability, rise of (right) populism etc. Right now I am pretty much unqualified to meaningfully help with any of them, but I do feel slightly more qualified about an issue that connects them all which is the role of modern media and the way (mis)information spreads. As this post is already tryingly long, I won't go &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f00ec8cdfcb#.uipgk19ru"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/12/eleven-tweets.html#more"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/facebooks-walled-wonderland-is-inherently-incompatible-with-news-media-b145e2d0078c#.ddp42t5wu"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-americans-against-trump-can-learn-from-the-failures-of-the-israeli-opposition?intcid=mod-latest"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2955021/shirtless-trump-saves-drowning-kitten/#pq=VD83C8"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which does not make picking ways to get involved easier. Writing code is unlikely to be helpful if you are not a part of the teams working on platforms that matter (Facebook, Twitter) and I never will be. Even if I were, ideas currently discussed are unlikely to be effective or can be just as easily abused to make things worse. There might be space for activism. Having done it before, I know how difficult it can be and how temperamentally unsuited I am for it. Before I worry too much about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to achieve my goals, I need to establish &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't feel much certainty at the moment, but what I am certain of is that the idea of "Reader", that kept cropping up on this site, is dead. I would still love to have such tool, but last year thoroughly proved it is at best a solution to a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="2016"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Books I read in 2016</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2017-01-01T22:38:56+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2017-01-01:articles/books-i-read-in-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;...were very few. This year has been a reading disaster. I have never read so few books since I learned to read. My list would be even shorter if it did not contain three items ambitiously described as books by publishers. If I change nothing this year, I will definitely change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say I did not read much. It was a US presidential election year and I read too many things that on the whole did not do me much good except further erode an already low opinion of mainstream journalism. I may (or not) come back to this in my annual review of past year. Also watched too much (good) TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly all my reading was done either on tablet (first 4 items) or Kindle (last two), both of which worked well and neither being perfect. However I expect this to be more common as convenience can't be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read much, but I can still recommend one book: The Oracle of Oil. Generally, I don't see a point in reading biographies and reading a book from the author you personally know also carries a risk of what to do if you don't like their work. Luckily for me Mason's book is excellent. A meticulously researched and engaging story of a father of peak oil kept me interested all the way through and left me pondering the power of wishful groupthink and (in)effectiveness of data substantiated arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured/dp/1491901942/"&gt;AngularJS Up &amp;amp; Running&lt;/a&gt; by  Shyam Seshadri and Brad Green . A good introduction to 1.x version of AngularJS framework that gives you a solid overview of what can be done and how you should go about it without getting lost in advanced specifics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI57PWo6HRAhVNeVAKHSQCA0kQFggaMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fweb-development%2Freactjs-essentials&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFce0pG40bQZb-AQTvziAd2Uxkowg"&gt;React.js Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by Artemij Fedosejev. A gentle introduction to React.js and Flux avoiding rest of React's ecosystem as it does building complex, multi-screen applications. Still good first book to read on the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/the-secrets-behind-great-one-on-one-meetings"&gt;The Secrets Behind Great One-On-One Meetings&lt;/a&gt; by Esther Schindler. From a series of recent O'Reilly short books (booklets?). Excellent guide on how to conduct effective one-on-one meetings (or receving one). Recommended for everyone with a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/designing-culture.pdf"&gt;Designing Culture&lt;/a&gt; by Kristi Woolsey. Another booklet, but not as good as the previous one. Too few practical examples and because of author's background it focuses mainly on using architecture/design to influence culture. Still useful if you are in a position to influence or change working environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Mujer Alta by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón. Not so much a book as a short story, but it was the first longer text I read mostly in Spanish (with &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of help from interleaved English text). It is a story I suspect just did not age well since 19th century when it was written. Skip unless you are learning Spanish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Oil-Maverick-Geologists-Sustainable/dp/0393239683/"&gt;The Oracle of Oil: A Maverick Geologist's Quest for a Sustainable Future&lt;/a&gt; by Mason Inman.&lt;/strong&gt; An engaging biography of M.K.Hubbert, the father of "peak oil". It is more than just a story of a brilliant man pushing an unpopular view and provides an opportunity to draw lessons still relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I will achieve my plan of reading more books than last year as I could hardly read fewer. Some fiction would be nice and another Spanish book would be welcome too. My goal is again 15 books, but if I don't read at least 10, then, well... I have a year to think of a suitable punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who know me should already know what I think and others would be smart to ignore pontifications of a random Internet stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have been following US presidential elections closely this year. Main result of this unhealthy obsession was waste of my time, nerves and that my already low opinion of news media has been further lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for this are many, but at the top of them it has to be how the "story" of Clinton emails was and still keeps being reported. Matthew Yglesias at Vox &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13500018/clinton-email-scandal-bullshit"&gt;explained it&lt;/a&gt; better than anyone else I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are a couple, to the story tangential, parts that bug me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, it’s certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Hillary Clinton — who is, again, his wife — also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what many of us, non-presidents, do too. However it seems obvious from hysterical reactions of last few months that most people actually do find it unusual. It is a view which in its essence is not any different from "why are you hiding it if you have done nothing wrong".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did we screw up development of Internet so much that it became more normal to be suspicious of running your own instance of a service that was &lt;strong&gt;designed and intended&lt;/strong&gt; to be used thusly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only describe it as sad that distributed, democratized infrastructure is not just too complex for everyone to run, but that doing so has now been legitimized as cause of suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Internet"></category><category term="elections"></category><category term="media"></category><category term="news"></category><category term="email"></category><category term="server"></category><category term="freedom"></category></entry><entry><title>DVD backups</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/dvd-backups.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-15T20:01:40+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-10-15:articles/dvd-backups.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finished backing up about 200 DVD disks to a drive, most of which are about 10 years old. Took me about 10 days and 1.5TB of space. I just copied data as it was the quickest and doesn't lose any information. Drive may complain and require change of a DVD region, but once they are copied, computer doesn't care anymore. Glad this part is over now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them needed cleaning, but I really had problems only with three, two of which remains not copied. As it happens it is also one of those on which I can find no visible scratch whatsoever. It used to work, because I've seen it. It does make you wonder what life span of disks really is, even when they were professionally produced. If you have any, I heartily recommend making a backup of them on some other medium. Unless of course they themselves are a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping disks regularly for 10 days does make you notice their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, especially hubs that keep disks in place with varying degrees of zeal. It is astonishing how many designs have been used over years and how few of them are actually pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown of teeth is probably the worst. Like a pitbull unwilling to release a disk until it is visibly bended or a tooth broken. Unless case is made of hard plastic there is really no excuse for using this design. Or any other "pluck" hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank god there are patents (as there always are) to prevent everyone converging to those few "push-to-release" that are actually nice to use. How could I after all value my life appropriately without it being spiced with needless hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I intend to process them into a different, smaller formats that require less space and are easier to (re)use. I am not in a hurry as this step still seems laborious and may also result in some content being lost. I am also thinking of making an additional copy together with file hashes so I could, in principle, recover if any of files gets corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="vacation"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="benefits"></category><category term="rest"></category><category term="test"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-02T15:17:24+02:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2016-07-02:articles/windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got a new &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/"&gt;travel computer&lt;/a&gt; this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt; for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad.

I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: &lt;em&gt;Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://diytoolkit.org/"&gt;DIY Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/"&gt;Missing Person&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Modiano.&lt;/strong&gt; The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/"&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/"&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt; by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/"&gt;The Shepherd's Crown&lt;/a&gt; by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/"&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Riad Sattouf.&lt;/strong&gt; A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058"&gt;Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in its last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent about a third of last year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin, confirmed that I am indeed in no way an equestrian person and culminating in my first visit to a doctor on my travels. Not only did I not "salvage summer" as &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I hoped&lt;/a&gt;, I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some decidedly less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family spent a lot of time in hospitals and I with them. Any time is really too much, but at least I can solace myself with good outcomes. Still, it would be great if none of us entered one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go through the list of things &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html"&gt;I planned&lt;/a&gt; a year ago as I did none of them. Life intervened, but I also did not use first half of the year as well as I should. However last couple of months were great. Reader still lives only in my head, but I did finally rewrite image-diet which is now called &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet2"&gt;image-diet2&lt;/a&gt; and is in pretty much everything better than previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and by the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year). I do plan to deepen my knowledge of Python3, ES2015 and ES2016 now that I have more opportunity to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tumultuous year and yet I feel calmer than ever which I mostly attribute to &lt;a href="http://www.tm.org/"&gt;TM&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to judge its other effects on me as they are clearly not as pronounced, but feeling more peaceful even under stressful circumstances makes meditating worthwhile enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to expect of 2016, but it feels seminal. The image stuck in my head for last couple of days was my first week at university. Totally clueless and wrong about where  life will take me, but knowing it will be different afterwards. In a way this year feels like one of last opportunities to &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt; redefine who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest change next year will be professional. I have happily worked for Aptivate for four years and hope to continue doing so in the future, but not solely. I will be available for freelance work. &lt;a href="mailto:markos@gaivo.net"&gt;Talk to me&lt;/a&gt; if you will need help from someone with &lt;a href="http://si.linkedin.com/in/markosamastur"&gt;my background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal for this year is to present a talk at a conference as I haven't done that in a while. "Competition" for slots at interesting ones is strong enough that giving even one will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that I am trying too avoid being too ambitious with my plans as I expect this year to be busy as it is. I plan to do a &lt;a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html"&gt;homeconf&lt;/a&gt; once per quarter and read more than I did this year. I will write publicly more as it would be difficult to write less and I am again not bereft of things to share (although most of them are not ready yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/vim-notebook"&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; hacked &lt;a href="http://bitterjug.com/"&gt;Mark's&lt;/a&gt; journal script to fit my needs. I can now summon it at any time and commit new entry without switching applications. My plan is mainly to jot down non-obvious problems and solutions I encounter, but I'd love to hear what others write in their work journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending few hours each month on tooling seems sensible. I have rejigged my set up late last year and difference is palpable. Development takes less effort with better results. Removing friction from doing the right thing is already a win, but if I can make it easier than doing wrong things, then that's golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case I have few firm plans for next year. Getting freelancing off the ground and presenting at conference should keep me busy enough. I expect to be overworked at least some of the time and yet it's been a while since I have felt so optimistic. Let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="2015"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="annual review"></category></entry><entry><title>Homeconf</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/homeconf.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-12-18T18:40:04+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-12-18:articles/homeconf.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to a bunch of topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only went to two this year. Instead I have collected links to talks I was interested in. However I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. I never get nearly as much out of them as when I listen in a dimly lit conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence I recently tried to replicate conference experience at home. I have downloaded the talks&lt;sup id="sf-homeconf-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1" class="simple-footnote" title="What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download?"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and dedicated a full day to watching them. It was brilliant. I especially liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that I could focus very much as I can at conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line-up perfectly matched my interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when I needed more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However not everything is better and there are aspects I have missed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all interesting talks are publicly available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussions about talks or ideas provoked by talks with other attendees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(ab)using power of pausing talks may interfere with your uptake as it can fragment talk's narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these I miss discussions the most. &lt;a href="http://friedcell.si/"&gt;Fry&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with a cool idea of starting a (video) talk "book club". The idea, which obviously needs a better name, is to meet fortnightly or so and have a discussion around talk everyone agreed to listen beforehand. It seems like a well balanced proposal to me, but I am curious to hear what others think about. Who would be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-homeconf-1"&gt;What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download? &lt;a href="#sf-homeconf-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Late 2014 review</title><link href="http://markos.gaivo.net/articles/late-2014-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-25T23:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>markos</name></author><id>tag:markos.gaivo.net,2015-01-25:articles/late-2014-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining
  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0"&gt;
   Charlie Brooker’s 2014 Wipe
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . A must watch is
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  on
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov"&gt;
   Vladislav Surkov
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I
  &lt;a href="40.html"&gt;
   became 40
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1"&gt;
    [1]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
  &lt;strong&gt;
   not
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
  &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2"&gt;
    [2]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/sup&gt;
  . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"&gt;
   quantified self
  &lt;/a&gt;
  movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.
  &lt;a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading"&gt;
   Again
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp"&gt;
   mjp
  &lt;/a&gt;
  against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It
  &lt;em&gt;
   is
  &lt;/em&gt;
  something to keep an eye on this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
