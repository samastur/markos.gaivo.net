  Only brains twisted in a pretzel can be completely fine with sweeping lightly-overseen secret surveillance of society, but feel personal freedoms are tyrannically trampled when soda cups are limited to sizes smaller than a bucket or when city bikes are introduced.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Whoever thinks losing privacy is fine because he has nothing to hide, is either seriously lacking imagination, an idiot or both.

  As a person with a somewhat unusual fondness for measuring and modelling my own behavior I should be a happy buyer of
  &lt;a href="https://jawbone.com/up" title="Jawbone's UP"&gt;
   gadgets
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for
  &lt;a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one" title="Fitbit"&gt;
   collecting data
  &lt;/a&gt;
  about myself and my environment. Yet so far I bought none, because they don’t seem to work
  &lt;em&gt;
   well
  &lt;/em&gt;
  without (occasional) data sync with producer’s servers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I really shouldn’t have to explain privacy standpoint of this. Describing my life and immediate environment in detail to a bunch of people I have never met, some of whom don’t even work for the company yet and trusting all of them that they will not compromise it for as long as they will keep it is to me self-evidently moronic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But I also avoid such hardware even when data in question might not be particularly sensitive. If I am paying for something to be manufactured, then I expect to own it. If a gadget depends on an external service to be useful, then I am really only leasing it. Services disappear for many reasons and it doesn’t make much sense to rely on their availability unless you can host them yourself. I loath ads, but paying for a service is not a guarantee for its continuing presence either.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am not against functionality that reasonably requires at least occasional connection to grid. Most social features probably do. Products like phones don’t even make sense without network. Web interfaces certainly do make these devices cheaper and more quickly evolving. So there are certainly good reasons beyond roping you in to make them partially off-loaded on web.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However I don’t want to use those features and I certainly don’t want to give up data I care about for features I don’t. What I expect from devices I buy is my control of data and purchased functionality without others meddling or peeking over my shoulders.

 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Warning:
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I started using
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Description of IRC"&gt;
   IRC
  &lt;/a&gt;
  almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of
  &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;
   Tumblr
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and a
  &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" title="Definition of neologism"&gt;
   neologism
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I never heard of something like that related to
  &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;
   WordPress
  &lt;/a&gt;
  although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a
  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29" title="Ulysses - an example of such work"&gt;
   Joyce-like stream of consciousness
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff
  &lt;em&gt;
   and
  &lt;/em&gt;
  really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.

 &lt;p&gt;
  It’s been a week with a lot of novelty. I got a new monitor, a nice 21″ LCD and it seemed appropriate to install a more recent, so to speak new, Linux distribution to go with it. I decided for Kubuntu and so far I quite like it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I’ve been a Linux user for more than a decade, but for last few years I haven’t really used my machine for everyday browsing. One reason were bookmarks accumulated in my powerbook and the other absence of Flash plugin for x86-64 platform. Flash plugin is still missing, but clever folks contrived a way to use the i386 one. Basically you install compatibility libraries and another, 32 bit version of Firefox.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, I mostly use the one without a plugin and so far it has certainly been an eye opening experience. Once upon a time sites fell in two categories, those made more or less completely with Flash and others, which didn’t use it at all. I have no idea when this changed, but it’s certainly not true anymore. These days most sites seem to be combination of both approaches.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As with Javascript it can work quite nicely when used sensibly and in an unobtrusive way. However, there are lots of sites like
  &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/"&gt;
   this
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which you simply can’t use without Flash. With proliferation of video and widgets, that play ever more important roles, I feel that web is becoming less open with every day.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I probably wouldn’t mind that much if Flash player itself was open (I don’t really care about development tools). Well, when all else fails,  you can always hope.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  In a few hours I’ll be going on a trip to Stockholm, so this is probably the last post of this year. It also happens to be the 100th post since it was started six months ago, making it a perfect place to recapitulate this year and this blog.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It has become a custom by now to flood web with such articles at this time of the year, so I’ve decided to limit mine to a much less talked topic, a state of web in Slovenia.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It’s certainly been an interesting year. We’ve experienced a rise of web standards
  &lt;a href="http://www.siol.net/"&gt;
   based
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.bof.si/main.cp2"&gt;
   designs
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and even got
  &lt;a href="http://rkg.gov.si/GERK/"&gt;
   first slovenian AJAX application
  &lt;/a&gt;
  intended for wide use. Truth be told, I don’t really know when it was launched, since I more or less stumbled upon it, but it seems that until this year, most of my colleagues weren’t aware of it either. Also it’s the year when feeds started to appear on prominent websites (with most of the public blissfully ignorant of them).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Sadly, it’s still safe to say that most new designs were done with table-based layouts and many table-less left much to be desired. Most of them are abusing or flatly ignoring semantic part of HTML tags and drowning in superfluous div’s. Little thought is spent on usability and even less on accessibility of new sites.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As customary by now, we seem to be lagging at least a couple of years behind the world. Slovenian web of 2005 is still very much the web of closed gardens. Feeds may have appeared, but their shy use is limited and there are few if any public APIs for developers to use.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I expect this will change in new year with public launch of
  &lt;a href="http://www.marela.si"&gt;
   Marela
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and hopefully other new services. Still, we’re not pioneers and it seems we don’t want to be.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On a personal front, it’s been a very busy, but also a very good year for me. Our service is about to go from a closed beta to more open one and first signs from our users are very positive. We started
  &lt;a href="http://web.zen.si"&gt;
   a series
  &lt;/a&gt;
  of web related talks through which I met many, from whom I’ve learned a lot. There’s more talent out there than I was aware of and it certainly gave me hope for the future.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I discovered the fun of writing and had a good fortune of having insightful readers who helped me tame my ignorance at least a bit. There were more of you reading this blog than I probably deserve and certainly many more than I’ve ever expected. I’m grateful to you all.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So to end this all, what are my blog resolutions for the new year?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I wrote more frequently than I first expected and probably should. In new year I’ll try to reduce the number of posts in favor of more useful content and prose that doesn’t feel like chewing cardboard.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I’ll try to write shorter posts except when content actually demands a longer one. I’d also like to hear what my readers would like to see more or less of so if you can spare a moment or two, please drop me a line in the comments.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I wish everyone all the best in new year.

  We’ve slept only a few hours today, to wake up early and drive in awful rain to Koper.
  &lt;a alt="Tim's page" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/"&gt;
   Tim Bray
  &lt;/a&gt;
  was speaking at
  &lt;a alt="Conference's page" href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/ooocon2005/"&gt;
   OOoCon 2005
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and I didn’t want to miss it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img alt="Tim Bray" class="imgleft" height="160" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/bray.jpg" width="150"/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I wasn’t disappointed. He’s an excellent speaker and even though I can’t say I’m a dedicated user of any office suite, I found his talk very engaging and thought provoking.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As every WordPress user knows, blogging interfaces can be rather underwhelming.  And WordPress is just an example, as the same can be said about most of them. But users are certainly not getting help from current versions of suites. Sad state of Blogger plugin for Word only exemplifies that.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Therefore OpenOffice of the future should recognize the rising popularity of blogs, wikis and personal voice on the web and do for them what yesterdays suites did for business communication (forgetting downsides for a moment). Making personal publishing less painful and more flexible.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If I understood Tim correctly, he wants to go even beyond that and imagines a world where OpenDocument is a sort of an HTML of tomorrow. Meaning it’s an open container for our data, that would get used by a different applications in myriad of ways, but would never lock our data in.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I’ve been looking at Atom and its publishing protocol lately and just thinking about it and about Tim’s talk, makes my head go dizzy from all the possibilities.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
