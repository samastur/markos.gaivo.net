  A colleague of mine told me a story couple of days ago, how he sat up a linux box for a friend so he could watch movies on his TV. By itself nothing surprising, since I’m sure we all know plenty of people who do just this or something very similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what did surprise me was the user interface my colleague built (as requested) for his friend. It has two buttons. First one starts playing first movie on the alphabetically ordered list. Second one deletes the first movie on the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s as simple as it could possibly get, but it forces you to adapt your behavior to it. Mind you that’s true for all interfaces, it’s just that this one makes it more obvious. Like in cinema you have to see the movie in one go or start from beginning and watch parts already seen. To see movie down the list you either need to see all before or chose not to see them at all. In a way, I’d say it’s an interface of a true movie buff. You watch all movies and when you do, you do it without compromising.
 </p>
 <p>
  I find it highly fascinating even though I don’t know why. Is it the strange interface, the fact that someone wanted it or something else? I’m not sure. I’m intrigued at how easy it has become to build your own interface and I’m sure it will get even easier. Yet this is not what fascinates me. But for some reason I just can’t get his story out of my head.

 <p>
  I knew it exists, but I haven’t looked into
  <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/python">
   Python on series 60
  </a>
  until yesterday and I wish I did so sooner. My mind is just flooded with ideas of what to do and I can easily see myself wasting lots of time playing with it. I do wish it was possible to build stand-alone applications, which wouldn’t require a separate installation of Python. As such I believe series 60 Python is more or less limited to prototyping and personal use.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s one thing that is a problem for an old goat like me (over 30 and loving it). It’s a pain in the ass to type anything substantial on mobile phone and although some new phones (like Nokia N70) have predictive dictionary for my language, lots of them including mine don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  I do have an idea on how to tackle this problem. Most of us have a vocabulary of few thousand words (unlike Shakespeare, who I’m told used 36 thousand of them), but we only use few hundred of them in our everyday life. Therefore if my text input heavy applications would continuously build a dictionary of words typed by user, they would fairly soon get a usable predictive dictionary for this particular user.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are downsides. You start with nothing and there’s a problem of how to build  a dictionary without annoying. You could tackle this by staying in learn-only mode until your dictionary-hit ratio rises above some threshold (80-90%?).
 </p>
 <p>
  There are also pluses. You get a dictionary that’s much better fitted to your user than a generic one, since it actually has words he uses. That is if I’m not underestimating dictionaries used in modern mobiles.
 </p>
 <p>
  What would make it even better is if such dictionary would be standardized so any application could use it.
 </p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">

  1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional
  <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">
   CSS Reboot
  </a>
  day. I find the idea at least odd, if not exactly wrong, so this blog won’t be one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As can be clearly seen, I’m not a graphic designer. Even though I’m certain my current design is better than previous was, it’s not exactly good either. There’s also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability. Then again, it’s not my intention to discuss a particular design as much as graphic design use and its role in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year. It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence. This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same mold?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or where it’s the story itself. But more often than not it’s something that not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting value. I wish I was like
  <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">
   Jon Udell
  </a>
  and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published, but I’m not.  What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one coherent whole and it’s vexing that design by its singularity implies that.
 </p>
 <p>
  In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they should know better only implies values I don’t share, but certainly doesn’t enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern widely used content management systems which as all software embodies values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often rather ignorant users .
