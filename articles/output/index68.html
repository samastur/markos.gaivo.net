  There’s a vast number of potential Marela features that we are able, but not willing to implement, since they are detrimental to our design goals. There are also many, which we are willing and will implement, but it doesn’t change the fact that there will always be parts where we won’t compromise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, even though it seems natural that benefits to many should be more important than benefits to few, I never got quite comfortable with this. That’s why we also want to make Marela as open as possible to let our members customize it without affecting other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, there are public APIs. They tend to work well for building new tools or interfaces, but offer little help in customizing existing ones. Which is what our users want most of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every modern browser lets users define a custom style sheet to change the presentation of websites. That’s why we recently added ID to body element, which lets users more
  <a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/13291">
   easily customize
  </a>
  the look of Marela alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there are tools like
  <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">
   Greasemonkey
  </a>
  , which let proficient users using Mozilla based browsers customizing existing interfaces. Greasemonkey works quite well, if you’re proficient in Javascript.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think the biggest problem with Greasemonkey (and custom CSS for that matter) is that it’s tied to a browser and a computer. If you change either of them, your customization won’t work anymore without significant effort on your part. Sometimes, in restricted environments, it’s not even possible to make it work. It’s a bit easier to make and transfer CSS customizations, but you’re still forced to carry your file around.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not too bothered with CSS. I simply don’t see much need for it beyond what Marela’s design and modern browsers already offer and I’m still biased against skin-deep themes offered by some programs. In any case a possible solution for it would be practically the same as what I have in mind for a case that does trouble me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Idea is pretty simple. Define javascript hooks that get called after window.onload event when they exist. If there’s an easy way to add your javascript file to a page (say, by uploading it to our server), then you can create a simple, but cross-browser and cross-computer Greasemonkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Question that remains is, is this appealing enough for you to use it?

  Few months ago, while exporting vCards from Apple’s Address Book (which uses UTF-16 instead of to me more common UTF-8), I discovered that there’s really no general agreement on which encoding should be used for storing vCards. It was quite a disheartening discovery, since you can’t get this information from a filesystem and it’s difficult to transform encoding to a uniform one, if you don’t know the encoding of the source.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to tackle this problem once other problems were solved and I’m happy to say my procrastination payed off. Mark Pilgrim wrote another excellent
  <a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/" title="Universal Encoding Detector">
   module
  </a>
  which solves my problem better than I ever could.
 </p>
 <p>
  Universal Encoding Detector is a python port of code used by Mozilla to accomplish the same thing and is really very simple to use. Obviously it can’t be perfect since it’s not possible detect encoding completely reliably. But it works quite well and if you need such functionality, you should really give it a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  And people say laziness doesn’t pay off.

  Years ago I published my first code and I still remember the anxiety. Will people notice that I’m an incompetent idiot or do they already know?
 </p>
 <p>
  I grew up a lot since then and these days I know I’m not a great programmer. Even more importantly, I’m comfortable with this. But as I was reading
  <a href="http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/">
   vobject’s
  </a>
  code to see how difficult it would be to add support for vCard 2.1 and hCard, it dawned on me… Jeffrey is a much better programmer than me and there’s little hope that my yet-nonexistent contribution won’t spoil his code.

  Nasty. Something new to worry about.
