  of mine is having a lousy year. He broke a leg, but further complications have brought him back to the hospital. I wanted to lend him some DVD’s to shorten those long hours in bed, yet who has the time to transcribe all those titles?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if you’re a Mac user, then there’s a program called
  <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">
   Delicious Library
  </a>
  which lets you (among other things) input those DVD’s by simply scanning the barcode with a camera. I have to say that calling that program awesome is an understatement. I simply can’t think of a better designed piece of software. It is as if every piece of the program, every line of code or UI ornament was specifically minted for your satisfaction. True craftsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I once heard that persian rugs were always created with one deliberate mistake, since only god was allowed true perfection. Well, there’s a mistake like that in Delicious Library. I tried to buy it for more than an hour, probably more like two, and it simply wouldn’t budge. You can’t buy it through a browser. You have to use its own interface which in my case simply refused to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally I gave up and wrote a message about my tribulations that in hindsight could be more friendly. I’ve soon received a friendly message from Mike together with an evaluation license, which allowed me to produce the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  I often complain about the way companies treat their customers and it’s really a pleasure to write about an experience like this. Not only do they produce a remarkable product, they also go all the way when it comes to helping their customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I only have to find a way to actually pay for it, since the product and people behind it more than deserve it.

  If you own a company, you’re bound to be buried under an avalanche of various offers. I got one from HP today, trying to sell me a color laser printer with the following foldout (click for a bigger picture):
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.marela.si/photos/7039/?original" title="Full size picture">
   <img alt="Print error on HP's foldout" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/Dhkv4lp6mpC2gzRgcAzdfaaFSnc.jpg"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mistakes happen and printing ones are no exception. But sending such foldout to prospective buyers of printers?
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that’s simply stupid.

  A few months ago during AJAX workshop, I stated that accessibility might not be mandatory in Slovenia, but that sooner or later it will be at least for public sector websites.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems I was
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200606/web_accessibility_to_become_mandatory_in_europe/">
   right
  </a>
  even if they are in no hurry to achieve it.
