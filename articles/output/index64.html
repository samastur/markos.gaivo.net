    I give up. I tried to think of a way to properly announce
    <a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">
     Fry’s new blog
    </a>
    , but I can’t think of any. Let me just say I’m glad that he decided to start it (again) and I look forward to reading it.

    A few days ago I came to
    <a href="javascript-enabled-spiders.html">
     recognize
    </a>
    that email hiding technique I use won’t work anymore. However I still think it would be a great idea if I could remove a part of a page from search index, even if it won’t help me hide from spammers in the long run.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I’d really like is to specify which parts of a page are not its content and can be safely ignored by search engines. Ignoring it would also mean absence of those parts from search indexes. Spiders could still follow links inside those parts, because I can still use
    <em>
     robots.txt
    </em>
    file if I really want to block their traversal. In effect, I’d like a more fine-grained approach to blocking, which doesn’t force the layout of my pages to even slightly favor spiders over people.
   </p>
   <p>
    The way I imagine it would work is by simply applying a class name to the parts of the page I’d want shielded. I don’t care much (yet) if such class name would need to be specified in robots file or if it would be some name achieved by a web consensus. As far as I can see both approaches would work equally well.
   </p>
   <p>
    The benefit of this would also be better search results. Every now and then I follow a search hit that fit my query because of a combination of site content and its navigation. Judging by my logs I’m not the only deceived soul. So, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to tell which parts are content and which aren’t?

    I’m not sure how I missed the original announcement of Simple List Extensions (SLE) for feeds, but better late than never.
   </p>
   <p>
    SLE is a very simple specification to extend feeds syntax to better support some common scenarios that weren’t covered with original specifications of RSS and Atom. Previously there was no way to tell feed readers/aggregators to display feed items in fixed order (e.g. feed with most popular stories of the day) or delete items not present in feed anymore (e.g. auction site feed with items matching a query).
   </p>
   <p>
    SLE also adds support for grouping and filtering of feed items, which might not be very useful with you average 10-item feed, but will be, if feeds will indeed become a general mechanism for transporting data and not only a tool to highlight most recent bunch of updates. In any case, you can read a very short
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sle/">
     specification
    </a>
    or visit
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/30/565222.aspx">
     latest announcement
    </a>
    which includes more explanatory links to why and how they can and already are used.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the way, I’m not sure if any reader apart from beta of IE7 already supports SLE, but I expect that most of them will soon. There’s little reason not to.
