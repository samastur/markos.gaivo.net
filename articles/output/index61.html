  In true Don Quixote fashion, I made a new attempt to make email harvesting more difficult. It won’t work forever, but it will work longer than
  <a href="hide-email-address-from-spammers-with-javascript.html">
   previous
  </a>
  one, which hasn’t fail yet either.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time I use a bit different approach. Instead of replacing spam-proof, but not directly usable email addresses with mail links on page load, I create mail links on page load, but populate them when mouse moves over them. This way they are still perfectly usable, but less likely to be abused. They are also less friendly, since you can’t see email address until you move your pointer over it. But that was the point, to prevent javascript enabled scrappers.

  Yesterday was a lovely sunny day.
  <a href="http://www.trepca.si/blog/">
   Sebastjan
  </a>
  and I were sunbathing at a nearby cafe, sipping juice and talking as we often do about Python related things.
 </p>
 <p>
  I noted how I’d hate to see
  <a href="http://www.effbot.org/">
   Fredrik Lundh
  </a>
  being swallowed by the black hole of Google, where too often good people go to never hear from them again. I simply can’t seem to write anything substantial in Python these days without relying on at least a piece of Fredrik’s code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sebastjan doesn’t share my pessimism and he might be right. Forgetting my possibly unsubstantiated fears for a moment, which Pythonista’s loss would in your opinion hurt our beloved language the most?

  Sometimes I’m really glad my brains don’t let my mouth shoot off as quickly as it would like.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was checking latest versions of
  <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">
   Prototype
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">
   Dojo
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">
   MochiKit
  </a>
  a couple of days ago and while I liked the first two, I had a much lower opinion of the third. In fact, I couldn’t understand why
  <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">
   Turbogears
  </a>
  has chosen MochiKit as its AJAX library and was about to write a post questioning just that.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m glad I didn’t. MochiKit still wouldn’t be my choice and probably won’t be when I’ll start using existing libraries instead of mine, but that doesn’t make it a bad choice. A lot of thought and effort has been put into its implementation and it shows.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are obviously things I dislike about it and the major one being the way it loads dependencies. I despise document.write and I disagree with argument made in comments (Safari’s use of defer on generated scripts). But I guess this is something reasonable minds can disagree on.
