  I admire the look and feel of
  <a href="http://www.mikematas.com/">
   Mike Matas’ new website
  </a>
  . It is really well thought through. I was also intrigued by how he did it, especially after getting a pop-up on my first visit advising me to use a more modern browser than a recent version of Firefox.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no point in speculating why some of its features don’t work in more browsers. But I was surprised to see that blurred images are served that way and don’t get blurred in browser. I am playing with an idea of implementing a gallery inspired by Mike’s work, but I would like to reduce manual labor needed for maintaining it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I wrote a function that blurs an image on canvas. You can
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/canvas_blur/" title="Javascript blur demo page">
   see it in action
  </a>
  or copy its code, if you find it useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The algorithm used is described in
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060718054020/http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/siggraph/workshops/wjarosz_convolution_2001.pdf" title="Link to PDF version of paper">
   2001 paper
  </a>
  by Wojciech Jarosz. Page contains two implementations, second trading algorithm purity for in my opinion nicer code. Increase number of passes or run it few times over an image, if you need a blurrier result.? Please ask, if you need help with its use.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also measured its speed to see if it fits my needs. That brought a new surprise. Firefox 3.5.8? on my Linux powered VAIO with 1.2GHz processor blurs image twice as fast as same browser on a Mac with a 2.8Ghz processor. Numbers between runs may vary slightly, but never much. No idea why this is happening, since all functions do is some basic math over items in array that should be well optimized everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am sure somebody can optimize it further, but I find it good enough for my use. Image isn’t very blurred after one pass, but one pass over a small image is also a good way to measure how fast a particular computer-browser combination is. On fast combinations I might go for multiple passes over images in view, but fall back to a single pass or no pass on slower systems.

  I am not much of a
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="My YouTube channel">
   YouTube user
  </a>
  , but I have recently started to upload some of my work
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="my demos on youtube">
   there
  </a>
  . You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes for products that may never be (especially if you are a
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta">

  </a>
  user).
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to our users so please tell us what you think.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is also a good time to mention that I don’t lead front-end team at Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our users more deeply than anybody else.

  I love using
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/" rel="homepage" title="N900">
   N900
  </a>
  , but there are applications or features I miss. This post is a reminder to me on what I might do if I find more time. Since list is too long for me to do everything (unless I suddenly win lottery), feel free to pick an idea you like and run with it. Just let me know afterwards where I can see results of your work or participate in development.

  <strong>
   Offline Wikipedia.
  </strong>
  When I am not behind a computer or reading, I like to be outdoors and even though cheap always available Internet was supposed to be here any day now, I regularly find myself information hungry in places with a very slow or no Internet connection. N900 with SD card could pretty much store everything I wanted and building an app that process and display information from
  <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/" title="Wikipedia dumps starting page">
   Wikipedia dumps
  </a>
  doesn’t look like a too difficult task.

  <strong>
   Better dictionary for Maemo.
  </strong>
  QStarDict port
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is great and it has become one of my favorite applications. However its user interface suffers from being a direct port of a desktop version one and could be improved with one that wastes less space and is orientation aware. Reading dictionary is one of few things I wish I could do in portrait mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Web platform for Maemo.
  </strong>
  Wouldn’t it be great if you could build Maemo applications with web technologies?
  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qtwebkit.html" title="Link to QtWebKit documentation">
   QtWebKit
  </a>
  is a great place to start and I am certain I could expose new functionality through
  <em>
   addToJavascriptWindowObject
  </em>
  of
  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwebframe.html" title="Link to QWebFrame documentation">
   QWebFrame
  </a>
  class. Beside exposing this stuff I would also like to create tools and interfaces for developers and users alike with which they can easily package a web application as a standalone Maemo application or in case of users, turn a website into an application (I know you can add a bookmark to a website but it is not quite the same thing).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/" title="Caffeine for Mac">
    Caffeine
   </a>
   for N900.
  </strong>
  I would like to pick
  <em>
   “Switch profile to silent for &lt;x time&gt;”
  </em>
  and know N900 will turn back normal profile when that time period expires. I always forget to turn ringing back on after I leave cinema.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monitor unknown calls.
  </strong>
  I don’t want to pollute my address book with every phone number under the sun, but I would appreciate if I could get a hint if I ever talked or called the number in question. Bonus points for using public phone books to fetch name for given number and parsing number for clues (which country or part of it is call coming from).
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not a complete list of things I want, but rest are mostly feature requests (except email client which currently really kind of sucks). For example I wish calendar had support for
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" rel="wikipedia" title="CalDAV">
   CalDAV
  </a>
  or PDF viewer for screen rotate, search and fit to width.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am aware that Maemo should be called MeeGo now, but a habit of years can’t be changed in few weeks. I searched for above applications and didn’t find them, but if you know of any I missed, then please let me know.
