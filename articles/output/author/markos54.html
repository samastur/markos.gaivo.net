  I never got a hang of “release early, release often” policy. I’m sure it works nice in practice, but it simply feels wrong to bestow an application to public use that you know is faulty. It should be my job to suffer through its problems until I can’t find any.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/code/marelapys60.html" title="Link to download page">
   here
  </a>
  it is. First public version of a Marela uploader for series 60 phones written in Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took longer then I thought, mainly because I overestimated my free time, but also because it grew new features. You can either shoot a new photo or choose an existing one, set its policy and tags and upload it to your Marela account. But whatever you do, you should treat it as you hopefully treat any first release. With utmost suspicion.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you should do it in slovene, unless you change code, an easy enough task even if code is a bit messy. I didn’t try to support Flickr, but it shouldn’t be hard to do so for those (unlike me) with free time and without a conflict of interests.

 <p>
  Have fun.

 <p>
  I really dislike headaches and although I don’t get them as often as I used to, they are usually not as easy to shake of. That’s why we have several different pills in our home to battle this nuisance. I recently noticed that one of them, Plivadon, has its name stamped in Braille on the box (click for a bigger picture):
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="imageL" href="http://www.marela.si/photos/6581/?original" title="Full size picture">
   <img alt="A box of Plivadon pill's" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/ndkvtPUIDCSxe-m9hlVPA8rI8xc.jpg"/>
  </a>
  <br/>
  It’s great that
  <a href="http://www.pliva.com/">
   Pliva
  </a>
  (Plivadon’s maker) makes its product more accessible to blind people. At the same time, this is also a good example of how difficult good accessibility is.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a common misconception that all blind people either know how to read Braille or can learn how to. In fact, a large part if not majority of them don’t and can’t. The reason for this is that you can learn Braille only if tips of your fingers are sensitive enough and that’s usually the case only for those who were born blind or became blind in their youth.
 </p>
 <p>
  But blindness can be caused by an accident later in life or by various diseases like diabetes, which means it’s far more common among older people, who through years of working with hands lost the necessary sensitivity in their fingers. They are in such cases forced to cope with their usual methods such as being very organized about where they put things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pliva (and other companies) could help them more. They could make the shape and size of the box more unique. They could stamp an easily recognizable pattern on parts of the box, just like they did with Braille. Anything that can make the tactile feedback more unique would probably help.

  Alas they, as more often than not we, don’t do what they easily could.

    Braille sign on Plivadon’s box is distinguishing enough mark for as long as there isn’t a similarly sized box and a sign at the approximately same position.

  Slovenian national television has a

  some of the graver errors. But his list is not nearly complete and here are some issues that bother me most:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   not only is Javascript often inlined, it’s also not degradable (crap like href=”javascript:void really has no place in modern web development)
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divitis" title="Description of divitis">
    divitis
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   inline CSS
  </li>
  <li>
   ridiculously long list of external resources (87 on main page), which result in excruciatingly long page loads on connections with high latency
  </li>
  <li>
   poor contrast between text and background in large parts of a page can be an accessibility problem
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  I could go on, but I don’t want to complain too much. As I’ve said before, this page is a clear improvement over the previous one and it’s also obvious from it that their creators do care about modern development and its often forgotten parts like accessibility.  This is exactly the reason why I decided to write about its failings and not about some other, more atrocious one.
  <a href="http://www.em3r10.com/">
   Zavod Embrio
  </a>
  shows an ambition for good designs and although I don’t think they’re quite there yet, I’m sure they soon will be.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I guess my notion that there’s no need for workshops on XHTML, CSS and web standards in general has been proven wrong.
