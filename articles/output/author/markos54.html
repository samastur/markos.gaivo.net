    I hate buying

    or monitors in Slovenia. I hate it almost as much as buying clothes, although looking for decent clothes is usually less futile.
   </p>
   <p>
    We need to replace a monitor, which developed an affection for pink, so we went out to find a replacement. A 19″ or larger LCD monitor with decent picture would do nicely. Surely a reasonable expectation.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems you can get anything you want as long as what you want has a picture that is either misty, has shadow or has a glossy enough screen to see yourself clearly in it even when turned on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since nothing was worth buying, we bought nothing. I actually don’t mind that they mostly sell cheap crap, if that is what is selling. But it is hard to imagine that there are so few people looking for decent monitors not to warrant at least one or two decent models on display.

    I like Firefox extensions and use a few myself. Web development without
    <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">
     Web Developer toolbar
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">
     LiveHTTPHeaders
    </a>
    extension would be pretty gruesome. However, there’s a downside to their use that is slowly starting to bother me.
   </p>
   <p>
    They often influence the way Javascript on page gets executed and can produce weird errors.
   </p>
   <p>
    I first noticed this while using Web Developer toolbar. Every now and then I got a strange exception, but I didn’t worry too much. After all, it wasn’t really surprising coming from an extension that by its very nature dabbled with the way browser interprets and displays a page and it didn’t really stop the script from working. Not pretty, but you learn to live with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Comes this weekend and I get a report that file upload doesn’t work in latest Firefox. I suspected extension conflicts and further examination proved the point. Page worked just fine in the same environment sans extensions.
   </p>
   <p>
    So what can you do, when you stumble on a problem like that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Testing your site in various browsers can be troublesome enough. Testing all combinations of extensions even for one browser would simply be impossible. You can’t exactly expect your users to uninstall their extensions just for you, but making workarounds for them doesn’t seem feasible either.
   </p>
   <p>
    So far I don’t see a good solution. Any ideas?

    I thought it would be nice to give a quick update on status of my Marela uploader for series 60 mobile phones. I have a working version, which is about two annoying bugs and a missing installer away from first release.
   </p>
   <p>
    My prognosis of a good day or so development left has so far been correct. I’ve spent a bit more than a day working on it since then and I don’t see bigger obstacles in front of me. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’m also quite satisfied with its speed. There are few rough edges where API is lacking, but in general it’s fast enough and not visibly slower than your average mobile Java application.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll be busy with work for next couple of days, so I expect to release it (together with source) somewhere in the middle of next week. And Python for series 60 phones definitely rules.
