  1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional
  <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">
   CSS Reboot
  </a>
  day. I find the idea at least odd, if not exactly wrong, so this blog won’t be one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As can be clearly seen, I’m not a graphic designer. Even though I’m certain my current design is better than previous was, it’s not exactly good either. There’s also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability. Then again, it’s not my intention to discuss a particular design as much as graphic design use and its role in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year. It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence. This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same mold?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or where it’s the story itself. But more often than not it’s something that not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting value. I wish I was like
  <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">
   Jon Udell
  </a>
  and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published, but I’m not.  What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one coherent whole and it’s vexing that design by its singularity implies that.
 </p>
 <p>
  In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they should know better only implies values I don’t share, but certainly doesn’t enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern widely used content management systems which as all software embodies values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often rather ignorant users .

   We’re preparing a workshop at Spletne urice (???Web hours??? in Slovenian, a weekly meeting of web enthusiasts) that will focus on AJAX, hosted by me and another Marko. Actually we’re preparing two of them. The first one will cover the basics of asynchronous transport and data, the second one will add some DOM scripting and review some AJAX frameworks.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Being the other Marko I can say this workshop will totally rock. It has to, because AJAX is cool, right? Instant fame, riches and all that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seriously though, I do believe it will be a great experience for those who’ll attend. Everyone is welcome, but only first 10, sorry, 9

  will get this chance because of limits imposed on us by the choice of venue. It’s even free (not likely to happen again any time soon), so price can be hardly something to worry about.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also help us make it better for you by contributing websites you’d like to see getting a makeover and telling us as much as you can about what you’d like to hear there (and what not).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update: Workshop is full and registration is closed. I’m sorry not everyone will get a chance to participate, but we might do another one later this year.
