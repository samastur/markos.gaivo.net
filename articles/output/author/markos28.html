  It’s been a while since I used
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="homepage" title="Python (programming language)">
   Python
  </a>
  for anything larger than scripts few tens lines long, so it feels really great to do it again. I did discover however that I became a bit rusty. Not so much in not being able to achieve what I want as not being sure that I do it in a sensible and pythonic way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been working on a private project where I came to a following problem.
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" rel="wikipedia" title="Application programming interface">
   API
  </a>
  calls can trigger various responses, somewhat like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">
   HTTP
  </a>
  , containing status codes together with a short description. Every faulty response should trigger its own exception, which led me to my first implementation:
 </p>
 <pre><code>
class Unauthorized(Exception):
    status = 101
    value = "Unauthorized."
</code></pre>
 <p>
  I didn’t like it even though it looks and behaves like it should. What I wanted was a better overlook of possible responses in a way where I have to make any possible changes easily and only at one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  My
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/pyexceptions/exceptions1.txt" title="Example">
   second attempt
  </a>
  was auto-generating exception classes using type. Since class definition took only a line instead of three, it certainly achieved better transparency, but I still had to make changes at two places.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/pyexceptions/exceptions2.txt">
   Final step
  </a>
  was to auto-generate classes in a loop. To do this I attached them to module namespace using globals() dictionary. Actually I used __builtin__ one at first, but it obviously didn’t work that great.
 </p>
 <p>
  So this is what I have now. It works and achieves my goals. I only need to change dictionary to add a new response or change existing one and it could hardly be more readable.
 </p>
 <p>
  But is it pythonic enough? If not, what would be, apart from traditional way described in first step?

  EuroPython 2008 is over. I packed and now I am waiting to leave for the airport to catch afternoon flight back home. Sadly I don’t have time to attend sprints and since I only recently started to write python again, I probably wouldn’t be of much use anyhow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Conference itself was great. Smaller than web conferences I usually attend with a more friendly, homey feeling, but with plenty of excellent talks where I learned a lot. I also met a bunch of friendly interesting people and had in general a wonderful time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was also interesting to compare the whole experience with other conferences I go to. Apple is popular, but there are fewer
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh" rel="wikipedia" title="Macintosh">
   Macs
  </a>
  than at web events.
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="homepage" title="Ubuntu (operating system)">
   Ubuntu
  </a>
  seems to completely dominate
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="wikipedia" title="Linux">
   Linux
  </a>
  crowd (me included), since it was the only distribution I actually have seen and Windows is in minority. Everyone is much more willing to participate to the point, where sadly not all who wanted to present a Lightning talk on last day had the opportunity to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I certainly hope to attend EuroPython 2009, which will be in Birmingham around this time next year. At the end I also have a present. Yesterday I got a license for
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wingware.com" rel="homepage" title="Wing IDE">

  </a>
  Professional and since I don’t need one, I’ll give it to the first person who expresses a wish to have it in comments and leaves his/her email address in relevant part of comment form.
