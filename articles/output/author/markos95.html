  I’m online again and have been reading news of the last few days.  So I’m kind of late to
  <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/friendship-and-hand-holding.html">
   discussion
  </a>
  about friendliness of communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  My personal experience with Python community has been absolutely wonderful. I’ve written
  <a href="no-language-feature-is-optional.html">
   posts
  </a>
  that could be seen as inflammatory, but the response I’ve got was just amazing. I haven’t been nailed to the cross for it and have learned a lot from people I admire, who took the time to leave a comment on my blog for which I’m really grateful. A couple of days ago I

  </a>
  developing atom feeds and got it immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  I find Python community very friendly and forthcoming, but I also believe Ian is right that Ruby might feel more friendly simply because a kind of youthful innocence. I wouldn’t really know, since I don’t use the language or follow up their discussions. I have however experienced in other communities the problem of a disconnect between old timers and newer members, who don’t share cultural history just yet. I think this is inevitable, since experience unlike knowledge can’t be easily given.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, I have a different problem with web related talks we’re organizing. It’s been our goal from the start to use talks as a conduit for slovenian web community building, which hasn’t happened to the extent I was hoping for. Our talks are well attended, but at the end our audience mostly leaves, which kind of saddens me. I’d like to get them more engaged, but I have no idea if the problem lies with us, organizers, or is just a result of slovenian culture.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess community building is just hard.

  I’m still mostly offline, but luckily UMTS offers a sort of solution. It works alright, but it is fairly expensive and I’m counting my bytes again. Still better than helplessly and hopelessly waiting for local telecom to fix ADSL, which judging by previous experience may happen who knows when.

  I’ve been looking for an Atom feed generator and I can’t find anything more than a few exploratory hacks. Is there something out there that would at least resemble

  </a>
  ?

  What I’d like is something that returns a proper Atom 1.0 feed and doesn’t choke on non-ascii using languages. I’m sure I’m missing something. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  I’ll be mostly offline at least until the middle of next week. Elektro Ljubljana was fixing something on Saturday and we only got our electricity back. ADSL is out and since Monday and Tuesday are holidays, I can only hope that Wednesday will bring good news.

  It’s a bit tricky to do Internet related development without, well, Internet.
