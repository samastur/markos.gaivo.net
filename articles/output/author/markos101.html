  I think HTML forms  are probably the least well designed part of X/HTML specifications and at least
  <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/" title="Link to WHATWG">
   some people
  </a>
  agree. They were fine when they came out, but time has moved on and form elements just didn’t follow. There are too many things wrong with them, but personally I mostly miss a good control for date handling and a slider.
 </p>
 <p>
  So
  <a href="/examples/slider/index.html" title="Slider example">
   here’s
  </a>
  my take on a slider, implemented with javascript. You can also download this example packed in
  <a href="/examples/slider.zip">
   a zip
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It works at least in all major browsers, but I don’t consider it finished. However, since I haven’t found the time to finish it and I don’t think I will any time soon, I’ve decided to publish it anyway. It may be useful to somebody.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s fairly easy to use, if you can live with its limitations. You can create a horizontal or vertical slider. I believe example is self-explanatory, but if you find it difficult to use, please let me know and I’ll help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Couple of things to remember. Code expects to find an image of button in subdirectory
  <em>
   img
  </em>
  and it shouldn’t be bigger than this one. If you need a different size, just correct javascript.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also
  <em>
   addEvent
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   delEvent
  </em>
  functions in
  <em>
   slider.js
  </em>
  should be replaced with something more robust, when
  <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/" title="PPK's blog">

  </a>
  team declares a winner.

  I think our first talk was a success. It certainly exceeded my expectations and I hope that most of those who were there feel the same. I was happy to see that a lot of us didn’t just leave, but stayed to enjoy conversation with other visitors. I hope this will become even more common and expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got a chance to talk to several people I wanted to meet or whom haven’t seen in a long time and I immensely enjoyed myself. Our conversations covered many topic, one of which was
  <a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/">
   WordPress
  </a>
  where I made some statements that on reflection probably deserve an explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said that WordPress sucks.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not true and I don’t actually mean it, but it is as true as what
  <a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/">
   wordpress.org
  </a>
  has to say about its product:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I use WordPress, but I can’t say I enjoy the experience. It’s certainly not worse than most similar stuff out there, but I think best have moved on. I don’t find default installation particularly pleasant to look at, its usability is questionable and in an age of WYSIWYG editors and online spell checkers, it’s hardly state-of-the-art either.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s still a good software and I wouldn’t nag, if the page didn’t also say:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your blogging software, not fight it.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Now that is pure crap. It would take too long to list everything I believe they got wrong, so I’ll concentrate on a couple of issues to illustrate my frustrations.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are things that are plain stupid. Theme editor tells me I could edit my template directly, if I made files writable. True, and I wouldn’t be the only person who could do that anymore. So you have a theme editor that is either useless or a security problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then there are things like user levels. As an administrator of WordPress you have to decide what level a user should be, but there’s not even a word of explanation in user interface about what that means. No hint, nothing. Sure, it’s explained in wordpress documentation, but is there a link to contextual help available on that screen? To any help whatsoever? No.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s stuff like this that makes me think WordPress has a long way to go for an average user.
