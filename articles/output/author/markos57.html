    It’s nice to have friends, especially the generous kind who buy a new
    <a href="http://www.europe.nokia.com/n80">
     Nokia N80
    </a>
    and lend it to you even before they had a chance to use it themselves. I’m not sure if N80 is the best mobile in the world, but it is by far the best phone I’ve had in my hands. I’m left with few excuses from finishing my uploader and provided that other obligations don’t tax me too much, it should be finished in next week or so.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve stumbled on two small problems. I’d like to automatically tag images with phone model on which they were taken, but I don’t know how to read it. Is this possible at all?
   </p>
   <p>
    The other problem seems to be a limitation of PyS60 API or its documentation. You are limited to use of text as tab titles, which are too small for this to be useful. That’s why you see developers displaying tab title in place of application title. Is there a workaround for this?
   </p>

    I normally don’t care much about games and write about them even less. But I get really annoyed when I see the same idiotic argument repeated again and again. As Eurogamer via TheRegister

     SCE UK Managing Director Rat Maguire said: “I don’t think it’s an expensive machine – I think actually, it’s probably a cheap machine. If you think a Blu-Ray player by itself might be £600-700, and we’re coming in at just £425, it’s a bargain.”

   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Cheaper than (outrageously) expensive is not necessarily cheap, it might be just less expensive. Personally, if people were screaming at me that 425 quid is too much as much as they do at Sony lately, I’d rather worry if 600 pounds price will simply be a disaster.

    I’ve been working on Marela uploader for series60 phones (those with Python support) and have had a great fun discovering the world of user interfaces on mobile devices.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you think there’s not enough space on your average web page, you really should try designing an interface for a device with stamp size screen with a resolution of
    <a href="http://www.c64.com/">
     Commodore 64
    </a>
    in full color mode (but luckily with far more colors) and input device that only kids could love. On top of that there’s a limited selection of existing UI controls to chose from and text can’t be too small to remain legible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, I think the major problems have been solved and I’m maybe a day or so of development and a decent camera phone away from first working version. I’m hoping to get it done by this weekend, but realist in me keeps screaming: “Maybe next week!”
