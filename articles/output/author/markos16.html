                <div>

  I was talking to my wife today about why an “Unknown Source” is becoming the most common source of visits on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://flickr.com" rel="homepage" title="Flickr">
   Flickr
  </a>
  . My guess is that it is almost certainly because a
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer" rel="wikipedia" title="HTTP referrer">
   <em>
    Referer
   </em>
  </a>
  header field is missing in page requests and Flickr is only relying on presence of this piece of data to discern sources. This might have made sense when browsers ruled the web, but we don’t live then anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simply put referrer field
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.36" title="Link to Referer field definition">
   can be added
  </a>
  to request only when request was triggered from source which also has an
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" rel="wikipedia" title="Uniform Resource Identifier">
   URI
  </a>
  address. Every web page has it since its address is also an URI, but most programs don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why referrers aren’t missing only from visitors using paranoid browsers or security software that stripped it out of requests, but also when page is visited from a link embedded in emails or instant messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Requests without referrers used to present a small enough subset of visits that most of us didn’t care. I first noticed this changing when Twitter clients became popular and now there are tons of apps behaving like this. With
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/" title="Link to specification">
   XMLHttpRequest Level 2
  </a>
  ﻿ even web developers will get a choice of making anonymous requests which won’t include potentially private data like referrers.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s nice. I have certainly visited places which I wouldn’t want to share with strangers. But I suspect this is not the common case and most of the time we don’t care telling which page or application sent us there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody can precisely predict future so specifications can never be perfect. But I am always amazed when reading core web specs like HTTP’s how insightful their authors were. That most programs don’t have a URI does not mean that they couldn’t. Practically anything can and definitely more things should.
 </p>
 <p>
  In principle it is possible for each program to have its own address which could be used as referrer
  <em>
   when a better option doesn’t exist
  </em>
  . I suspect this would be against the spirit of specification, but likely not against its text.
 </p>
 <p>
  However better options often do exist. Lets take
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://twitter.com" rel="homepage" title="Twitter">
   Twitter
  </a>
  as a popular example. Every link that triggers a visit from Twitter was included in at least one tweet and every tweet is also published on web. It might not be accessible to everyone, but it does have an address. I see no reason why that address could not be used as referrer by Twitter clients.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is originating content or its address that interest me, but really, almost anything truthful beats an unknown source. Just knowing name of the service (like Twitter) or app used (e.g. Tweetdeck) would be better than nothing. By the way there is another header field that could provide such insight:
  <em>
   User-Agent
  </em>
  . Sadly it is notoriously unreliable and often missing as well, but that’s another long story.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, if I come back to Flickr. I can’t really tell how much Flickr can or could know. I suspect more than it tells, but I would be astonished if they are not mostly in the dark too. Web was largely built by people too busy (and often too lazy) not to cut corners. Meaning: learning and doing as little as possible to get something to work and sometimes we pay price for our ignorance. But it’s a small price compared to waiting for

  After years of personal embarrassment I finally managed to update look and code of my website. This actually happened last week and I wanted to write this post sooner, but
  <a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si" title="Supervizor">
   other things
  </a>
  came in-between. There are still bugs I need to fix (iPad footer is better than it was, but not fine), but﻿ overall I’m pretty happy with how it turned out.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a second site I built using
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/" rel="homepage" title="media queries">
   media queries
  </a>
  and I learned lots. When I learn a bit more about mobile web, I might write a post about few gotchas for new developers, but this is not that post. This post is about
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  tag because it bugged me when I made that first design and I spent a remarkable amount of time on it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  My problem with it came down to its definition.
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  can be used only to mark up contact information about content’s author. In HTML 4 this was limited to authorship of whole page. For HTML5 it
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-address-element" title="Definition of &lt;address&gt; in HTML5 specification">
   was “widened”
  </a>
  to authorship of sectioning element like
  <code>
   &lt;article&gt;
  </code>
  (so if you have more than one article on page, each can contain its own, different, address for its author). You can’t however mark any address with it and after lots of searching I found
  <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-February/014023.html" title="Ian's message from February 2008">
   this old message
  </a>
  from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson" rel="wikipedia" title="Ian Hickson">
   Ian Hickson
  </a>
  which explains why (I’m not aware of any later clarifications).
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t agree with everything said. Mostly correct use is not necessarily a proof of well-designed element. My bet would be that
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  was a rather unknown tag exactly because of its limited use and was thus used mostly by those that dig deeper into standards, which sound also like people who care  how things are used as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still most points are valid. Loosening definition would make it less meaningful.
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" title="Specification of hCard microformat">
   There
  </a>
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/adr" title="Specification of adr microformat">
   are
  </a>
  microformats that you can use instead and most annoying problems (allowing only inline content) have been fixed. We also have better tools for parsing HTML so  it really doesn’t matter much if its definition feels completely right or not. It’s good enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end I still decided to mark my contact information on
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net">
   my homepage
  </a>
  with
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  anyhow (augmented with
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCard" rel="wikipedia" title="HCard">
   hCard
  </a>
  ), because I am after all the sole author of this website.

  and

  for a couple of years now, but I’ve only recently spotted how they apply to me. I conceitedly thought that they have little influence on me, but reality is as always more nuanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still seem to be unmoved by most attempts. I don’t care that my

  until I see some other tangible benefit. On the other hand keeping a list of books and having a goal on how many to read has indeed influenced my behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why did this last example work? Because I actually care about reading books. It’s something I enjoy and want to do more, so “achievements” actually mean something to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started to track books I read because I wanted to know how many I actually read, in what order and does that say something about me. I also thought setting an annual goal would provide a good incentive to keep reading, which it did, but not exactly in a way I expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a goal certainly helped me with additional motivation to read books when otherwise I might not have for one reason or another, but it also  gave me a nudge against dropping books I didn’t like since doing so would mean time invested in them would not get counted to achieving my goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also pushed me to thinner books. Less pages mean on average quicker completion. But there are books where six or eight hundred pages doesn’t feel too long and they shouldn’t be postponed just because it might take me more than a couple of weeks to read them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time pressure also leads to more cursory reading. I’ve never been able to read as deeply as I thought I should, but having a goal definitely changed my reading for the worse. Again, properly engaging a book takes more time and hence makes it harder to achieve the goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t notice any downsides from having a list itself which has indeed provided me with insights about me I probably could have if I wrote a diary. Which I don’t, so I’m left to piecing my long term memories mostly from circumstantial evidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I’m keeping a list, but ditching my goal. Upside is simply not worth the downsides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I see my experience as providing a lesson. It’s relatively easy to go through different gaming mechanisms and find a combination that you think will give you results you want. However, incentives are a bitch and I think it’s practically impossible to reliably predict what will actually happen in use.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why complex modern games take so much time to create, because getting things right takes time and is not something you can reason through.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m with
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://headrush.typepad.com" rel="homepage" title="Kathy Sierra">

  on this and you really ought to read

  </a>
  . I’m skeptical of general awe around gamification, but I do think game mechanics will have an important role to play in our future. Still I would prefer if we cautiously applied new tools where they can’t hurt much before we plaster badges of suck everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a while now I’ve been annoyed by how every gamification talk has about 20 minutes of gushing of its virtues and about 20 seconds on possible ethics problems, but my experience has reminded me of the deeper problem, which is that it is simply much easier to inflict damage to your users and your product (brand) than getting it right.
