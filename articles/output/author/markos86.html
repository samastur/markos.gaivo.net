  Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I’ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.

  This week was a bit special with higher frequency of errors than usual on account of my talk. First I became Marko Semastur. Then a day or so later Makro Samastur was in vogue, which it’ll remain to be until the subtitles on footage are changed. I find the tech

  connotation of Makro highly amusing, but not quite a T-shirt material.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was talking to a friend yesterday who’d like to put up a website displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can’t say I persuaded even myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I’d like to know is how important do you think is your name or the name you choose for a company for your recognition and success?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been going back and forth over this and I can’t say I’m any wiser.

  I love going to our weekly web talks not so much for the talks themselves (although they are great), but conversations you get to have there. A part of a recent one rendered from memory and shortened for readers pleasure:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Those delete strings of yours should really be post requests.
   <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/" title="Link to web accelerator that shouldn't be used">
    GA’s
   </a>
   pre-fetching might destroy user’s data.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me:
   </strong>
   &lt;beeeeep&gt; Google. RFC says should not must.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, since it also says multiple GET requests should yield same result, it really is a must for delete.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me
   </strong>
   (not ready to give up): True, but so many form buttons will look like crap.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, you can hide them by removing border, setting background-color to background and fixing font size to 1 em.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me:
   </strong>
   Uhm, this might work, but probably doesn’t, because browsers use controls from operating system.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, try it.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I may be stubborn, but I’m not a complete moron. So I did and here’s
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/hidebutton.html" title="Demo">
   the result
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As can be seen, it works beautifully in Firefox (1.0+) and Opera 8 (I share my visitors indifference to earlier versions). It doesn’t work in Safari at all, but since its buttons are not obnoxiously ugly, I can live with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it has unseemly big padding in Internet Explorer, which is the real deal-breaker for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think demo’s style sheet is pretty self explanatory, but here’s what I did by mostly following Fry’s instructions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   set border to 0
  </li>
  <li>
   same for padding and margin
  </li>
  <li>
   set background-color of the button to the same value as background of the document
  </li>
  <li>
   did the same for color of text
  </li>
  <li>
   set the size of button text to 1 em so it’s displayed in right size in every browser
  </li>
  <li>
   set cursor to pointer, since it’s not done automatically for buttons
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

  </a>
  was also correct that bold and italics work and underline doesn’t, but you can simulate later with border-bottom. Except in IE of course, on account of padding.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s another shortcoming to consider. If background is an image or a color gradient instead of a solid color, this trick won’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, any ideas about what to do with IE?

  Talk is behind me and I’d like to thank all who came and especially to those, who stayed through the whole thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, there are certainly things I’d do differently, if I got the chance, but at least it wasn’t a horrendous experience for me and the audience like my last talk a few years ago was.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll post my slides of dubious value later today or tomorrow at the
  <a href="http://web.zen.si">
   usual place
  </a>
  and I’ll try to prepare a Lessig-like webcast over the weekend. I hope to see everyone next week on Tuesday. Boštjan Ber??i?? will talk about responsibility of publishers on web, a talk that everyone who publishes on the web in Slovenia should probably hear.
