    Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.
   </p>
   <p>
    A year that started with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">
     Aaron Swartz’s
    </a>
    death and ended with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">
     Nelson Mandela’s
    </a>
    never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.
   </p>
   <p>
    In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at
    <a href="http://aptivate.org/">
     Aptivate
    </a>
    and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am <em>not</em> an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.
   </p>
   <p>
    I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra">
     Socotra
    </a>
    sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.
   </p>
   <p>
    What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.
   </p>
   <p>
    List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).
   </p>
   <p>
    Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with
    <a href="https://github.com/samastur">
     my Github history
    </a>
    and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.
   </p>
   <p>
    I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.
   </p>
   <p>
    This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of
    <a href="https://twitter.com/trepca">
     Sebastjan
    </a>
    ’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead of building tools like
    <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">
     mjp
    </a>
    or
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet">
     image-diet
    </a>
    I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.
   </p>
   <p>
    My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.

    Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.
   </p>
   <p>
    I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to
    <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">
     set things right
    </a>
    . No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I’ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?
    </em>
    <br/>
    You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are
    <sup>
     <a href="#avoid-stupid-1-note" id="avoid-stupid-1">
      [1]
     </a>
    </sup>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?
    </em>
    <br/>
    Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Why am I trying to say this?
    </em>
    <br/>
    Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Is it a matter of a principle or degree?
    </em>
    <br/>
    I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight
    <sup>
     <a href="#avoid-stupid-2-note" id="avoid-stupid-2">
      [2]
     </a>
     .
    </sup>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Can I be persuaded?
    </em>
    <br/>
    I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.
   </p>
   <p>
    I don’t always run through all these questions, but I’m sure I’m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.

     Update 2:
    </strong>
    Tickets are now
    <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">
     on sale
    </a>
    and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Update
    </strong>
    : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no good way of contacting organizers
    <sup>
     <a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1">
      [1]
     </a>
    </sup>
    and not much travel information either on
    <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">
     the DjangoCon’s website
    </a>
    or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
   </p>
   <p>
    First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
   </p>
   <p>
    It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
    <strong>
     er
    </strong>
    , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
   </p>
   <p>
    No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
   </p>
   <p>
    In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
   </p>
   <p>
    I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.
