  I’ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I’ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it’s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Customer relationship management.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you’re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I’m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There’s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn’t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it’s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is this so hard for others to learn?
 </p>
 <p>
  By the way, if you need to buy computer hardware and you want to get a good price with as little fuss as possible, please let me know and I’ll send you his email address.

  This is probably the last part in series of post dealing with Beautiful Soup. At least for a while. Good news is, I found the bug that caused observed weird behavior and it was partly self-inflicted.
 </p>
 <p>
  My problem appeared, because I was using variables that resembled html tags (e.g. imgs, ul…) and didn’t put space after &lt; in statements as good practice dictates. So I  had statements like:
  <br/>
  <code>
   <br/>
   if (i&lt;imgs.length)
   <br/>
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Beautiful Soup relies on
  <em>
   sgmllib.py
  </em>
  for processing of documents and it’s sgmllib that causes havoc by processing CDATA (found in script and style blocks), when it shouldn’t. But the problem is not really with sgmllib, which has a literal switch to turn processing off. It’s just that Beautiful Soup doesn’t use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So fix is really adding one line
  <br/>
  <code>
   <br/>
   self.literal = 1
   <br/>
  </code>
  <br/>
  after
  <em>
   if
  </em>
  statement on line 835. Or
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/BeautifulSoup.py" title="Link to fixed version">
   downloading fixed version
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Reading source I also realized another potential pitfall. If you use javascript to inject javascript with document.write method, you’ll probably confuse sgmllib (and hence Beautiful Soup). When processing CDATA, it doesn’t try to understand it, it just copies data until it finds an endtag (&lt;/script&gt; in javascript’s case). But if you’re doing that, you have yourself to blame.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   BeautifulSoup 2.1.1 is
   <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/index.html">
    out
   </a>
   , which fixes my bug and several others. So you better fetch that version.

  It seems I praised Beautiful Soup too quickly. I was playing with it yesterday and discovered it mangles Javascript included in file. I can’t say it does this every time, but it’s fairly obvious if you have few kilobytes of code stuck in file. There you have it, another argument why Javascript and CSS should be stored in external files.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not an option for me though, so I’ll have to work around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s still a great module, as long as you can work within its limitations, but it’s not panacea. At least not yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I find time, I’ll try to fix the problem, since I really dislike idea of processing files using usual methods (regular expressions &amp; co.).
