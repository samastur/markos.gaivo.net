  <strong>
   Warning:
  </strong>
  this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started using
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Description of IRC">
   IRC
  </a>
  almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">
   Tumblr
  </a>
  and a
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" title="Definition of neologism">
   neologism
  </a>
  that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I never heard of something like that related to
  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">
   WordPress
  </a>
  although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.
 </p>
 <p>
  However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29" title="Ulysses - an example of such work">
   Joyce-like stream of consciousness
  </a>
  . I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.

  I’m not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but three are probably enough. So here’s my annual list of books I read in 2011. I typed “this year” first. Obviously celebrating new year is not enough for my mind to completely switch and I’ll probably be in danger of writing 2011 where I shouldn’t for another fortnight or so.
 </p>
 <p>
  This year I
  <a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Why I stopped">
   stopped striving
  </a>
  to read a certain number of books and I’m happier for it. Looking at the list I am mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice of books related to my career. It’s not that books themselves would be that bad (most weren’t), but why on earth did I spent so much time reading things tangentially related to what I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To safeguard from my tweaking of this blog’s theme, here are recommended spelled out:
  <em>
   Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Unfolding of Language
  </em>
  . I also want to specifically mention
  <em>
   Copper
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Atlas of Remote Islands
  </em>
  both great in their own way which are not bolded but maybe they should be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon  and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following  these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of  another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise to fix it for next year’s list, especially since I’ve never earned enough to buy even one book.

  Without further ado here is the list:

    The Yacoubian Building
   </a>
   by Alaa Al Aswany. I read this at the end of January, when Egypt was engulfed in protests against regime and it provided an excellent background to why protests were happening. A truly captivating look at modern Egypt society.

    Introducing HTML5
   </a>
   by Bruce Lawson, Remy Sharp. A good, hands-on introduction to HTML5 and related technologies that occasionally forgets to mention browser support and is already somewhat out of date. Luckily second edition is out (or should be soon).

    HTML5: Up and Running
   </a>
   by Mark Pilgrim. I read this one almost back to back with Introducing HTML5 and there is surprisingly little overlap between them. It can feel too geeky and repetitive in places, but it has best treatment of data-* I’ve seen so far.

     Herztier

    23 Things They Don’t Tell You about Capitalism

 <p>
  This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one reason or another put off. I find I read too much from “Anglo-Saxon” authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.

  It’s hard to judge importance of events as they are unfolding or soon afterwards, but 2011 feels in many ways like a historical year and I will be amazed if it doesn’t prove to be such. Arab spring and
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598">
   unresolved eurozone crisis
  </a>
  alone practically guarantee that this will be a year to remember although it’s too soon to say in what light. There are definitely plenty of good reasons to worry, but there always are.
 </p>
 <p>
  This year was also a year of big personal changes. I left
  <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Zemanta's homepage">
   Zemanta
  </a>
  in summer and went on sabbatical. Leaving a company in  the middle of economic crisis doesn’t sound like a prudent idea, but I’ve yet to regret it. I started contributing open source before I left, but having more time certainly helped me do more of it and with a bit of luck I may even finish first version of my web Instapaper client before this year runs out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I built
  <a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si/" title="Supervizor's homepage">
   Supervizor
  </a>
  with Primož, which is a project I am most proud of. We haven’t done everything we set to do yet and we unlikely will this year, but I hope that in early 2012 Supervizor’s data will become easily accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were lots of experiments on myself. Having a list of possible (and finished) projects on wall feels liberating. Counting books I read
  <a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="My post on gamification of reading">
   doesn’t work
  </a>
  , but digital sabbath is great. I left Twitter for better use of my time, but it’s really too soon to tell. I  learned and did a lot, more than I expected, but as always less than I hoped. Somewhat unintentionally we reduced our carbon footprint further even though we traveled a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also finally found time to really reflect on what I want to do and my
  <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html" title="Brad Neuberg's post on creating personal reasearch agenda">
   personal research agenda
  </a>
  is getting more of a shape. I want to work most on use of open data to improve civic engagement and exploring
  <a href="reading-sources.html" title="Link to definition in second annotation">
   social software for introverts
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So what will 2012 bring?
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody really knows, but this year it became clear to me that I want my work to be more socially engaged and I am thrilled I got an opportunity to join amazing people at
  <a href="http://www.aptivate.org/" title="Aptivate's homepage">
   Aptivate
  </a>
  for I hope a long time. I’ll continue to work on a so far semi-public open data project which I am sure will become public soon. I plan to read lots of books, but start less than two new projects. I am sure I won’t finish everything I set to do, but that’s alright. We always overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in ten so I  just need to keep going.
 </p>
 <p>
  And surely I will continue to worry. There are only more reasons to despair over environment and eurozone of today might not be around this time next year. However we are not pilling on canned food yet so optimist in me obviously hasn’t completely died yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But first I will enjoy holidays. I hope you will too and I wish you a happy new year.
