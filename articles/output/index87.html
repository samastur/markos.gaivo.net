  Jensen Harris posted an interesting
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/11/29/497861.aspx">
   observation
  </a>
  few days ago regarding “help” in programs. Microsoft’s usability tests showed that help is mainly used by experts and enthusiasts.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t have data to back or refute his observations, but I did check our logs to see how often is our help accessed and the number is so low that I’ve seem to have talked about it with practically everyone who actually visited it. Sure enough, all of them belong to more experienced users who probably need it the least

   </a>
   <a name="invhelp01-2005-12-04">
   </a>
  </sup>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So let’s assume that Harris is correct and inexperienced users don’t access help. I think there are three basic questions you’re faced with when designing a help system
  <sup>
   <a href="#invhelp2-2005-12-04">
    2
   </a>
   <a name="invhelp02-2005-12-04">
   </a>
  </sup>
  :
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   How do you get users to discover and use help?
  </li>
  <li>
   How do you meet the needs of those who do?
  </li>
  <li>
   What about the rest?
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Harris’ observation doesn’t change questions, but it does lead to possibly different answers.
 </p>
 <h4>
  1. How do you get users to discover and use help?
 </h4>
 <p>
  The least you can do is to make it accessible from a standard place, which is in the top right corner and to make it easily recognizable. If everyone says it’s Help, you should too and don’t hide it with small font size (we might be guilty of this) or inappropriate colors.
 </p>
 <p>
  We tried to go further than this by also offering various means of help in close proximity to where we think our members might appreciate it. It’s still too early for any conclusive remarks, but compared to general use of our help, I’d say it’s showing good promise.
 </p>
 <h4>
  2. How do you meet the needs of those who do?
 </h4>
 <p>
  If Harris is right and I believe he probably is, then this translates to what are the needs of experienced users and how to meet them?
 </p>
 <p>
  What we have so far is simply a FAQ of real questions that have been asked previously. It’s amazing how many companies think FAQ is a place where they should put questions they’d like users to ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not much and certainly not enough, but there’s been little need for more so far. What I’d like to add is tips and other ways to deepen the knowledge of those, who’d like to do so, but so far we’ve lacked the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve certainly discovered that absence of tutorials teaching basic use of our service is not a problem. At least not so far.
 </p>
 <h4>
  3. What about the rest?
 </h4>
 <p>
  No matter how hard you work to make your product simple to use and how easy it is to get to help for it, there will be people who won’t know how to use it and either can’t or won’t use help. How do you help them?
 </p>
 <p>
  One way is to make mistakes really cheap. Everything that delays a successful completion of intended task is a burden, a price payed not in money, but in satisfaction. We’re trying really hard to make it as cheap as possible with lightning fast pages and non-destructive interfaces where it’s easy to fix mistakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think it’s already clear that this approach works very well. I believe it’s partially responsible why our help section is rarely used.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are options like tooltips, that we haven’t used yet. There are probably options we haven’t thought of. We’ll try new stuff and when we do, I’ll let you know what we’ve learned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notes:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <a name="invhelp1-2005-12-04">
   </a>
   Before I go on I should point out that it would be nice to think that we got our interface right and most people don’t need to visit our help section. However, without data to back that up it could also mean help is just too difficult to find. It’s something we’ll have to investigate.

  <li>
   <a name="invhelp2-2005-12-04">
   </a>
   I assume that all conscientious designers strive for a design that would remove the need for help. I also recognize that this is often not possible.

  Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I’ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.

 <p>
  This week was a bit special with higher frequency of errors than usual on account of my talk. First I became Marko Semastur. Then a day or so later Makro Samastur was in vogue, which it’ll remain to be until the subtitles on footage are changed. I find the tech

  I was talking to a friend yesterday who’d like to put up a website displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can’t say I persuaded even myself.

 <p>
  What I’d like to know is how important do you think is your name or the name you choose for a company for your recognition and success?

  I’ve been going back and forth over this and I can’t say I’m any wiser.

  I love going to our weekly web talks not so much for the talks themselves (although they are great), but conversations you get to have there. A part of a recent one rendered from memory and shortened for readers pleasure:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Those delete strings of yours should really be post requests.
   <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/" title="Link to web accelerator that shouldn't be used">
    GA’s
   </a>
   pre-fetching might destroy user’s data.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me:
   </strong>
   &lt;beeeeep&gt; Google. RFC says should not must.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, since it also says multiple GET requests should yield same result, it really is a must for delete.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me
   </strong>
   (not ready to give up): True, but so many form buttons will look like crap.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, you can hide them by removing border, setting background-color to background and fixing font size to 1 em.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Me:
   </strong>
   Uhm, this might work, but probably doesn’t, because browsers use controls from operating system.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fry:
   </strong>
   Well, try it.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I may be stubborn, but I’m not a complete moron. So I did and here’s
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/hidebutton.html" title="Demo">
   the result
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As can be seen, it works beautifully in Firefox (1.0+) and Opera 8 (I share my visitors indifference to earlier versions). It doesn’t work in Safari at all, but since its buttons are not obnoxiously ugly, I can live with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it has unseemly big padding in Internet Explorer, which is the real deal-breaker for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think demo’s style sheet is pretty self explanatory, but here’s what I did by mostly following Fry’s instructions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   set border to 0
  </li>
  <li>
   same for padding and margin
  </li>
  <li>
   set background-color of the button to the same value as background of the document
  </li>
  <li>
   did the same for color of text
  </li>
  <li>
   set the size of button text to 1 em so it’s displayed in right size in every browser
  </li>
  <li>
   set cursor to pointer, since it’s not done automatically for buttons
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.friedcellcollective.net/" title="Fry's web home">
   Fry
  </a>
  was also correct that bold and italics work and underline doesn’t, but you can simulate later with border-bottom. Except in IE of course, on account of padding.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s another shortcoming to consider. If background is an image or a color gradient instead of a solid color, this trick won’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, any ideas about what to do with IE?
