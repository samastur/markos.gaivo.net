  It’s hard to judge importance of events as they are unfolding or soon afterwards, but 2011 feels in many ways like a historical year and I will be amazed if it doesn’t prove to be such. Arab spring and
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598">
   unresolved eurozone crisis
  </a>
  alone practically guarantee that this will be a year to remember although it’s too soon to say in what light. There are definitely plenty of good reasons to worry, but there always are.
 </p>
 <p>
  This year was also a year of big personal changes. I left
  <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Zemanta's homepage">
   Zemanta
  </a>
  in summer and went on sabbatical. Leaving a company in  the middle of economic crisis doesn’t sound like a prudent idea, but I’ve yet to regret it. I started contributing open source before I left, but having more time certainly helped me do more of it and with a bit of luck I may even finish first version of my web Instapaper client before this year runs out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I built
  <a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si/" title="Supervizor's homepage">
   Supervizor
  </a>
  with Primož, which is a project I am most proud of. We haven’t done everything we set to do yet and we unlikely will this year, but I hope that in early 2012 Supervizor’s data will become easily accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were lots of experiments on myself. Having a list of possible (and finished) projects on wall feels liberating. Counting books I read
  <a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="My post on gamification of reading">
   doesn’t work
  </a>
  , but digital sabbath is great. I left Twitter for better use of my time, but it’s really too soon to tell. I  learned and did a lot, more than I expected, but as always less than I hoped. Somewhat unintentionally we reduced our carbon footprint further even though we traveled a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also finally found time to really reflect on what I want to do and my
  <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html" title="Brad Neuberg's post on creating personal reasearch agenda">
   personal research agenda
  </a>
  is getting more of a shape. I want to work most on use of open data to improve civic engagement and exploring
  <a href="reading-sources.html" title="Link to definition in second annotation">
   social software for introverts
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So what will 2012 bring?
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody really knows, but this year it became clear to me that I want my work to be more socially engaged and I am thrilled I got an opportunity to join amazing people at
  <a href="http://www.aptivate.org/" title="Aptivate's homepage">
   Aptivate
  </a>
  for I hope a long time. I’ll continue to work on a so far semi-public open data project which I am sure will become public soon. I plan to read lots of books, but start less than two new projects. I am sure I won’t finish everything I set to do, but that’s alright. We always overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in ten so I  just need to keep going.
 </p>
 <p>
  And surely I will continue to worry. There are only more reasons to despair over environment and eurozone of today might not be around this time next year. However we are not pilling on canned food yet so optimist in me obviously hasn’t completely died yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But first I will enjoy holidays. I hope you will too and I wish you a happy new year.

  I’ve been fiddling with my website again, changing theme switching from somewhat dumb class based system to a more proper one using alternate style sheets. I learned that picking a style sheet in browser applies those changes only to currently open page, so for style sheet selection to persevere it needs a bit of Javascript support from website owner. Personally I find this just stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  The easiest way to remember visitor’s preference is to store it in his browser. Cookies used to be popular before they were deemed evil, but they have other limitations as well. Hence popular switch to HTML5 in-browser storage technologies like
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">
   localStorage
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I think there is one important difference between cookies and tools like localStorage that is often overlooked and it’s not the size of data that can be stored. Cookies are sent with
  <em>
   each page request
  </em>
  while data stored elsewhere isn’t. Changing them on any side will automatically share state with the other. I use localStorage in my theme switcher because I think server doesn’t need and should not know which theme is used. But for storing shared data, especially one that expires, cookies remain a reasonable if not best choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of this is exactly new, but I think it is worth remembering. In other news I dislike interface limitations of Chrome more and more (exceptions are Developer Tools and extensions framework).

  Google Reader was redesigned lately and I’ve been annoyed ever since. I had a dubious privilege of cutting and changing product features people loved in pursuit of
  <del>
   higher
  </del>
  different goals, so I try to be understanding when others do the same. I mostly found clumsy workarounds for removed features, but I do wish I could at least still trust that list of unread items actually has
  <em>
   all of them
  </em>
  . On a positive note I can save some electricity now because copious amounts of “helpfully” white whitespace illuminate this room brightly enough that you wouldn’t sit naked in-front of your computer even with lights turned off. That is if you are the sort of person who likes doing that but stops short of flashing your neighbors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still strongly dislike changes made, but I continue using Google Reader, because crack-heads don’t give up dope just because it was cut too thinly. I cherish my list of reading sources and like a gardener I have been cultivating it through years because I believe they make me better informed than I would be if I relied only on links shared by others. This may be elitist, but it is also true.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are biased when choosing friends and communities we belong to. At the very least we enjoy our life more when surrounded with like minded people which is really a lighter shade of group think. We share to tell stories as much about what is shared as we do about who we are. Even when not self-censoring or trying to project an image we still are horribly bad at evaluating what influences us and how. Sharing everything, as
  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">
   this idiotic article
  </a>
  suggests, doesn’t fix this
  <sup>
   <a href="#reading-sources-note-1" id="reading-sources-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . It’s still content from same people only more of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there are social new sites, which are in essence news organizations with bigger editorial board. Their focus might not be the same and their world view less obvious (or not) as of traditional boards, but the end result really isn’t all that different. I don’t dread waking up in a world without
  <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple's homepage">
   Apple
  </a>
  as I do in one without  fish, but it is not articles about all things piscatorial that keep popping up on regular basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t make socially filtered news useless, just limited and best suited for finding out what is popular at this moment. They should be a side dish not the whole diet. Getting some of your information diet from social sources may improve it, but relying only on them is just stupid. I wouldn’t fret so much if I didn’t worry about development trends — latest Reader changes being one example of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reader had two methods of sharing. Obvious one was button Share which was adequately replaced with sharing to
  <a href="http://plus.google.com">
   Google+
  </a>
  circles. The other one, which was the one I actually relied on, was to create public feeds for articles marked with certain tags. The most important difference is that in first case you grouped by intended audience and in second by actual content
  <sup>
   <a href="#reading-sources-note-2" id="reading-sources-2">
    [2]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . Instead of following me, you could just follow my selection on particular topic which in most cases would probably be closer to what you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  By itself stripping a feature like that doesn’t mean much. However when I also judge other changes such as aforementioned abundance of whitespace, removal of “Note to reader” and  new reading unfriendly theme, it’s easy to come to conclusion that all roads now lead to Google+. Reader’s role is at best to feed its younger brother with stuff to socialize around.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be wrong to attribute these changes simply to competition with Facebook since they are a part of a larger trend to social curation. I find this trend just a normal consequence of a web ecosystem where most product innovation happens in VC funded startups. How companies were funded was always a part of their DNA and economics of today’s VC environment for companies that will probably be acquired at some point (and let’s be honest, who REALLY believes most news experiments won’t be?) almost demands a quick and high growth. It’s not impossible to achieve this with sources-based product, but it’s certainly harder and less obvious than creating another twist on social news.
 </p>
 <p>
  If my first and main point was a personal appeal to seek insight also in your own, personally picked sources, then my second is to question if shaping web and world with it should really be left only to industry and academia. It really doesn’t have to be this way.

   Browser’s history is a great place to see just how much of what we visit is unimportant, unrepresentative and often unsharable. A small friction necessary for a deliberate act of sharing is actually a feature that gives at least a modicum of reflection on content’s share-worthiness.

   Feeds enable that and are one of crucial building blocks for what I started to call
