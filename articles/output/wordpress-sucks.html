    I think our first talk was a success. It certainly exceeded my expectations and I hope that most of those who were there feel the same. I was happy to see that a lot of us didn’t just leave, but stayed to enjoy conversation with other visitors. I hope this will become even more common and expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    I got a chance to talk to several people I wanted to meet or whom haven’t seen in a long time and I immensely enjoyed myself. Our conversations covered many topic, one of which was
    <a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/">
     WordPress
    </a>
    where I made some statements that on reflection probably deserve an explanation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I said that WordPress sucks.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is not true and I don’t actually mean it, but it is as true as what
    <a href="http://http://www.wordpress.org/">
     wordpress.org
    </a>
    has to say about its product:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I use WordPress, but I can’t say I enjoy the experience. It’s certainly not worse than most similar stuff out there, but I think best have moved on. I don’t find default installation particularly pleasant to look at, its usability is questionable and in an age of WYSIWYG editors and online spell checkers, it’s hardly state-of-the-art either.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s still a good software and I wouldn’t nag, if the page didn’t also say:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your blogging software, not fight it.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Now that is pure crap. It would take too long to list everything I believe they got wrong, so I’ll concentrate on a couple of issues to illustrate my frustrations.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are things that are plain stupid. Theme editor tells me I could edit my template directly, if I made files writable. True, and I wouldn’t be the only person who could do that anymore. So you have a theme editor that is either useless or a security problem.
   </p>
   <p>
    And then there are things like user levels. As an administrator of WordPress you have to decide what level a user should be, but there’s not even a word of explanation in user interface about what that means. No hint, nothing. Sure, it’s explained in wordpress documentation, but is there a link to contextual help available on that screen? To any help whatsoever? No.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s stuff like this that makes me think WordPress has a long way to go for an average user.
