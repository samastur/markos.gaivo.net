  So I am not much of a planner. I didn’t read tomes and I read few work related books, but on the other hand I really enjoyed most of those I did read. Still it seems to be a challenge for me to really dive into world literature. I purposefully slowed my reading in second half of the year with aim of getting work done which
  <a href="2012-review.html">
   didn’t pan out
  </a>
  that well either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I suspect I also didn’t read as many tech books as I wanted because I mostly buy them in electronic form and don’t enjoy reading books on computer screens including tablets. E-ink readers are nicer, but underpowered and have issues displaying code samples well. Postponing decision is not working out, but I’m not happy with existing choices. Not sure how this will be resolved or when.

  Links in the list still point to Amazon, but without affiliate IDs and are as always present only for those that are at least fine. Bold is reserved for those I found best:
  <em>
   The White Tiger, Safe Area Goražde, Bright Earth, Next World Novella, Behind the Beautiful Forevers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Sense of Ending
  </em>
  . If you are a web front-end developer, then you should also look at
  <em>
   Undercover User Experience Design
  </em>
  and
  <em>

  .

    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/White-Tiger-Novel-Aravind-Adiga/dp/1416562605/">
     The White Tiger
    </a>
    by Aravind Adiga.
   </strong>
   I bought this book by mistake and don’t regret it. An astonishing and brutal portrait of India’s underclass that grips you and doesn’t let go even after you finish its last page.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Experience-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321719905">
    Undercover User Experience Design
   </a>
   by Cennydd Bowles &amp; James Box. Excellent guide on doing UX on the cheap that is also a good introduction to UX. There are few people who couldn’t learn something from this book.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Redbreast-Jo-Nesbo/dp/006113399X">
    The Redbreast
   </a>
   by Jo Nesbø. Gripping enough if you don’t mind in-text ads for previous books or genre tropes. A good book for beach, if you are into that sort of thing. I don’t see myself reading another one from this series.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Safe-Area-Gorazde-Eastern-1992-1995/dp/1560974702">
     Safe Area Goražde: The War in Eastern Bosnia 1992-1995
    </a>
    by Joe Sacco.
   </strong>
   Certainly one of the best graphic novels I’ve ever read which can teach something about conflict even those who have been following it closely. Deserves all awards it got.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-JavaScript-high-quality-applications-libraries/dp/1847194141/">
    Object-Oriented Javascript
   </a>
   by Stoyan Stefanov. An introduction book to Javascript (in browsers) best suited to programmers of other languages. Chapters about classes and inheritance are good reminders of less often used parts for intermediate Javascript developers.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Habit-Art-Alan-Bennett/dp/0571255612">
    The Habit of Art
   </a>
   by Alan Bennett. Multi-layered drama with much humor. I saw its original production and I still think of it often.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140811514X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title">
    The Stone

   by Marius von Mayenburg. A recurring motif of modern German literature – doubtful memories of recent past. I would love to see it on stage.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Were-Nobody-Insiders-American-Politics/dp/006201577X">
    We’re with Nobody: Two Insiders Reveal the Dark Side of American Politics
   </a>
   by Alan Huffman &amp; Michael Rejebian. An interesting first-person look at how background researchers work in US politics without sordid details.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-Strange-Room-Damon-Galgut/dp/1848873220">
    In a Strange Room
   </a>
   by Damon Galgut. A book about traveling, un-articulated rootlessness and failed human connections that switches remarkably well between first-person and third-person narrator. It brought up some of my own almost forgotten memories and I would recommend it without hesitation.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375704027/">
    Norwegian Wood
   </a>
   by Haruki Murakami. I don’t really know what to think of this book. It’s well written, engaging and reading it I do not not feel like time was wasted. On the other hand I don’t see depth others see or a master writer others describe. Still not a bad book to pick up.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Earth-Art-Invention-Color/dp/0226036286/">
     Bright Earth
    </a>
    by Philip Ball.
   </strong>
   I bought this book after I heard his talk on the same subject but still missed that it is foremost about painting colors. It is an amazing book which has significantly changed my perception and understanding of paintings and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in colors or visual arts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tempo-tactics-strategy-narrative-driven-decision-making/dp/0982703007/">
    Tempo
   </a>
   by Venkatesh Rao.
   <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/">
    Venkatesh’s blog
   </a>
   is among the most interesting ones I follow, but I was less impressed with this book on role of tempo in our lives and ways to work with it. There are certainly interesting ideas in it, but it often felt disconnected and too full of new jargon. I suspect I need to read it again with more focus and fewer interruptions.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Earth-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0062067753/">
    The Long Earth
   </a>
   by Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Baxter. The first book in upcoming trilogy. Fun to read and well thought through look at what could happen if we suddenly had infinite natural resources.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innumeracy-Mathematical-Illiteracy-Its-Consequences/dp/0809058405">
    Innumeracy
   </a>
   by John Allen Paulos. Easy and interesting read, but it’s not clear to me what the purpose of the book is. It’s unlikely to be read by those who need it most or offer much in ways of tools and techniques. It is more of a cautionary tale of mistakes and lament about state of affairs which is still the same.
  </li>
  <li>
   How to Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish without a Trace by Frank M. Ahearn &amp; Eileen C. Horan. A warning book for those who are not particularly paranoid and less useful as a how-to. The rest of us largely won’t be surprised although you might find out a thing or two. I hated author’s voice.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Next-World-Novella-Matthias-Politycki/dp/0956284035">
     Next World Novella
    </a>
    by Matthias Politycki.
   </strong>
   A beautifully written multi-layered book about death, marriage, loneliness, memories… One of those rare books that not only can be re-read, but should be.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="https://smacss.com/">
    SMACSS
   </a>
   by Jonathan Snook. A guide to writing modular CSS that should be easier to maintain and more reusable. A must read for web developers even if they don’t agree or use all described techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553">
     Behind the Beautiful Forevers
    </a>
    by Katherine Boo.
   </strong>
   A devastating, uncompromising and well-researched look into life in an Indian slum. Together with White Tiger it significantly influenced and informed my view of India and I wholly recommend it.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062009494">
    Dodger
   </a>
   by Terry Pratchett. An enjoyable and informative recreation of Victorian London with a story a bit too predictive, straight-forward and far fetched for adult readers. Read only if you’re Terry’s fan or not an adult.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Ending-Deckle-Vintage-International/dp/0307947726/">
     The Sense of an Ending
    </a>
    by Julian Barnes.
   </strong>
   Opinions may vary, but I recommend it without reservations. Really well written and was able to evoke memories of my youth without really describing it. I enjoyed reading it till the surprising and devastating end. Doubtlessly I will read it again.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  This year? More useful education, more foreign literature and hopefully one or two longer ones that have been on the shelf for a while.

  I’m not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but three are probably enough. So here’s my annual list of books I read in 2011. I typed “this year” first. Obviously celebrating new year is not enough for my mind to completely switch and I’ll probably be in danger of writing 2011 where I shouldn’t for another fortnight or so.
 </p>
 <p>
  This year I
  <a href="gamification-of-book-reading.html" title="Why I stopped">
   stopped striving
  </a>
  to read a certain number of books and I’m happier for it. Looking at the list I am mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice of books related to my career. It’s not that books themselves would be that bad (most weren’t), but why on earth did I spent so much time reading things tangentially related to what I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To safeguard from my tweaking of this blog’s theme, here are recommended spelled out:
  <em>
   Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Unfolding of Language
  </em>
  . I also want to specifically mention
  <em>
   Copper
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Atlas of Remote Islands
  </em>
  both great in their own way which are not bolded but maybe they should be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon  and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following  these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of  another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise to fix it for next year’s list, especially since I’ve never earned enough to buy even one book.

    by Guy Deutscher
   </strong>
   . Fascinating and well-written book about how human languages did and might have developed. Can’t recommend highly enough.

    23 Things They Don’t Tell You about Capitalism

   by Ha-Joon Chang. A must read for free-market proponents and less so for well-read people. It contains some surprising information for everyone and is easy to read. I wish though there were more links to data in notes.

  This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one reason or another put off. I find I read too much from “Anglo-Saxon” authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.

  until I see some other tangible benefit. On the other hand keeping a list of books and having a goal on how many to read has indeed influenced my behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why did this last example work? Because I actually care about reading books. It’s something I enjoy and want to do more, so “achievements” actually mean something to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started to track books I read because I wanted to know how many I actually read, in what order and does that say something about me. I also thought setting an annual goal would provide a good incentive to keep reading, which it did, but not exactly in a way I expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a goal certainly helped me with additional motivation to read books when otherwise I might not have for one reason or another, but it also  gave me a nudge against dropping books I didn’t like since doing so would mean time invested in them would not get counted to achieving my goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also pushed me to thinner books. Less pages mean on average quicker completion. But there are books where six or eight hundred pages doesn’t feel too long and they shouldn’t be postponed just because it might take me more than a couple of weeks to read them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time pressure also leads to more cursory reading. I’ve never been able to read as deeply as I thought I should, but having a goal definitely changed my reading for the worse. Again, properly engaging a book takes more time and hence makes it harder to achieve the goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t notice any downsides from having a list itself which has indeed provided me with insights about me I probably could have if I wrote a diary. Which I don’t, so I’m left to piecing my long term memories mostly from circumstantial evidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I’m keeping a list, but ditching my goal. Upside is simply not worth the downsides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I see my experience as providing a lesson. It’s relatively easy to go through different gaming mechanisms and find a combination that you think will give you results you want. However, incentives are a bitch and I think it’s practically impossible to reliably predict what will actually happen in use.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why complex modern games take so much time to create, because getting things right takes time and is not something you can reason through.
 </p>
 <p>

  . I’m skeptical of general awe around gamification, but I do think game mechanics will have an important role to play in our future. Still I would prefer if we cautiously applied new tools where they can’t hurt much before we plaster badges of suck everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a while now I’ve been annoyed by how every gamification talk has about 20 minutes of gushing of its virtues and about 20 seconds on possible ethics problems, but my experience has reminded me of the deeper problem, which is that it is simply much easier to inflict damage to your users and your product (brand) than getting it right.
