            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>The last catalog post in the series of what occupied me last year, but this one has a lineage. I’ve been writing about the books I read annualy since 2009. I was young back then.</p>
<p>Links still lead to Smile Amazon. Those without them are not terrible (like previous years), just without an entry there and I was too lazy and tired from hiking to find a different link. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them. I recommend those in bold. Those wanting to improve their focus may want to check <em>Deep Work</em>.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/">Securing Angular Applications</a> by Ryan Chenkie. While it covers all important bits it is too full of unrelated fluff and could be edited to a quarter of its length. Best for those new to Angular and web development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Evolution-Intelligent/dp/0008226296/">Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith.</strong> I love this book, but not everyone does. A fascinating look at development of intelligence and cephalopods for those interested in both and I was not bothered too much that author occasionally wanders a bit.</li>
<li>Security and Frontend Performance: Breaking the Conundrum by Sonia Burney &amp; Sabrina Burney. A short focused book on improving website's security and performance mainly through better use of HTTP, improving delivery of 3rd party content and use of service workers. A bit aged after 2 years, but still provides a good overview for those using 3rd party resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Chess-Story-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171691/">Chess</a> by Stefan Zweig. A novella about chess, human need for stimulus and psychological torture.</li>
<li>Schachnovelle by Stefan Zweig. Same as previous one, except without minor translation errors. Figured out I could read it in original German and liked it enough to do so.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Arab-Future-Childhood-1985-1987-Graphic/dp/1473638283/">The Arab of the Future 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987</a> by Riad Sattouf. Third part of trilogy that will have at least 4 parts. Highly recommended for those who liked first two.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/My-Sister-Serial-Killer-Novel/dp/0385544235">My Sister, the Serial Killer</a> by Oyinkan Braithwaite. A crime novel by a Nigerian author about two sisters, one of which with a penchant for dead now ex-boyfriends. Not my usual fare, but I enjoyed this quick-to-read book a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng/dp/0735224293">Little Fires Everywhere</a> by Celeste Ng. Recommended by Tomaž. I was not bothered by it being somewhat predictable, as I don't think author generally tried to or needed to surprise reader, but I think the book would be better if author didn't use future to somewhat sentimentally resolve some narrative threads. Otherwise well written engrossing story with rare off note and I really enjoy reading it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Train-Time-Essential-Heinrich-Boll/dp/1935554328/">The Train Was on Time</a> by Heinrich Böll.</strong> A German soldier boarding a train to the front in Poland has a premonition of his impending death (train ride not incidentally following route of millions of European Jews). A meditative mostly first-person account on war, life, loss and historical disgrace. The kind of book that changes you.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a> by Cal Newport. I'm ambivalent about this book since I am definitely in its target market, think it has some solid advice and writing itself isn't bad. However, I also mind that much of it is poorly sourced or supported, some clearly coloured by author's prejudices (matching mine) and all of it too closely shaped as self-help genre these days demands.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Springtime-Broken-Mirror-Mario-Benedetti/dp/1620974908/">Springtime in a Broken Mirror</a> by Mario Benedetti.</strong> A book about a political prisoner in Uruguay and his family in exile written by Benedetti when he was, too, in exile. Wise, witty, moving, profound book is certainly one of the best I read in the last decade and deserves to be read slowly and more than once.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Beautiful-Summer-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241983398/">The Beautiful Summer</a> by Cesare Pavese. A short novel about a girl’s loss of innocence in 1930’s Turin. Another take on a familiar story which is neither good enough to recommend nor mediocre enough to complain. Translations occasionally felt dated and to me difficult to understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Functional-Steps-Transforming-Programmer-dp-1449368174/dp/1449368174/">Becoming Functional</a> by Joshua Backfield. “...in Java move to Scala.” OK, but with annoying boss examples and cumbersome language pick.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Failure-Memoir-Gary-Shteyngart/dp/0812982495/">The Little Failure</a> by Gary Steyngart. Generally not a fan of autobiographies, but I read this one because I like his writing and do not regret it. It is not only a seemingly very honest assessment of his life, family and relationships so far, but it also provides an interesting view in being Russian Jewish immigrant in USA.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Functional-Thinking-Paradigm-Over-Syntax-dp-1449365515/dp/1449365515/">Functional Thinking</a> by Neal Ford. Similar to Becoming Functional with more emphasis on how to think “functionally” then what functional programming is. Also very focused on Java developers and diluted by involving too many alternatives and not enough focus. Still, better than Becoming Functional.</li>
<li>Functional Programming in Python by David Mertz. A short introduction to functional programming with Python3. Liked it better than the other 2 as it felt more on point. Again wished it touched also on architecture parts of development.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Node-Front-End-Developers-Server-Side-Applications-ebook/dp/B0073U0XFM/">Node for Front-End Developers</a> by Garann Means. Read to kill time on a flight since it is already very old (2012). Basic enough for examples to mostly still work, but not sure who the audience is. Useful information could be condensed to quarter of its already meagre size.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Burial-Rites-Hannah-Kent/dp/0316243922/">Burial Rites</a> by Hannah Kent. A dramatised story about last woman to be executed in Iceland, picked while we were there. I got progressively more interested and by the end could hardly put down this well written story.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Levels-Julian-Barnes-3-Apr-2014-Paperback/dp/B011T7HJZQ/">Levels of Life</a> by Julian Barnes.</strong> A book about finding and losing love, especially tragically by the author. Or as Independent put it better: "Anyone who has loved and lost can't fail to be moved by this devastating book."</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008211213">Running Blind</a> by Desmond Bagley. I rarely read crime novels, but I enjoyed this one visiting so many Icelandic tourist spots. Written well enough and certainly surprising enough to keep my attention until its end.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cat-Man-Two-Women-ebook/dp/B075V3VP46/">A Cat, a Man, and Two Women</a> by Junichiro Tanizaki. A novella about a love triangle with a true feline rival. Enjoyable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Little-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241357454/">The Lady and the Little Fox Fur</a> by Violette Leduc.</strong> Almost poetic and most truthful description of poverty and loneliness which demands to be read slowly as every sentence is rich with meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect 2020 to be busy so I’ll be happy if I manage to read as much as passed year. I hope to keep my fiction and non-fiction selection varied and keep trying to avoid Anglo-Saxon authors.</p>
<p>This year I enjoyed almost everything I read purely for my own pleasure and <a href="../on-technical-writing.html">almost nothing</a> I read for work. My work-related reading will likely be directed by work circumstances and hopefully less frustrating.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Early this year I was reading a couple of books about Typescript and got really annoyed by basic technical errors and poorly conceived books structures. Python <strong>is</strong> a strongly typed programming language and if the intended reader is expected to already have mastered Typescript’s basics, then they probably don’t need a chapter on how to install it. I wanted to vent about decline in quality of technical books in recent years, but I am glad now that I didn’t get around writing about it.</p>
<p>This summer I decided to use some of my downtime during treks to update and improve my knowledge of functional programming by reading 3 books on this topic and I could hear my inner voice screaming, again: “Who is this book for?” Too much effort was spent on technical minutiae and none whatsoever on how to actually design and develop programs of non-trivial length, which in my experience is one of the main stumbling blocks for inexperienced developers.</p>
<p>None of these books was new with the oldest coming out in 2012. All three were published by O’Reilly which at least back then was considered a respected source of technical content. So, quality erosion started sooner than I noticed, but still seems to be getting worse with publishers cutting corners everywhere while trying to compete with self-published authors whose books often seem overstuffed with marginally useful information to fatten them to book length, probably to raise their perceived value so they can become a source of passive income and/or improving author’s resume.</p>
<p>Of course some books, self-published or not, are good, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find them between so many bad ones. Especially since number of online reviewers have not scaled nearly as much and hence most books have few if any reviews.</p>
<p>This is a problem for people like me, who like to learn about a new topic through books, but I think the effects may be larger. Books can be a good way to coalesce and distill knowledge to a package that could serve as a good introduction to topic’s novices. Modern web development has become a complicated affair with surprising and often depressingly short turnaround of technologies used and while it is useful to have someone explain in detail a tool that will likely be largely abandoned in two years time, I find there are not enough of them aiming for longer shelf life by teaching foundational knowledge.</p>
<p>This spring I threw out more than a meter of old, mostly computer-related books that were now completely obsolete and I could certainly do the same with most electronic books that I have, if I could be bothered. While I was doing this, weighing on each book if it still has something valuable to say, a question kept coming up. If I was starting my career today, as many are, how would I even go about it?</p>

                <p>…were too few. Even worse than 2016 from which I lifted this post’s beginning. At least none of them were duds. All of them are worth reading, but I reserved bold for those that are not too niche.</p>
<p>Links lead to Smile Amazon. I still get nothing from referrals, but at least some charity might get few cents instead of also nothing. Brodeck Report is lacking a link because graphic novel has not been translated to English yet. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Magic-Watches-Smart-Introduction-Watchmaking/dp/2940506124/">The Magic of Watches</a> by Louis Nardin. A very fine introduction to the world of (wrist)watches and one of the best designed books I own. A very good introduction for already interested that is at its weakest when it is trying to sell you this hobby, but more than makes up for it elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Platero-Spanish-Juan-Ramon-Jim%C3%A9nez/dp/9706665641/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8">Platero y Yo</a> by Juan Ramon Jiménez</strong>. Bittersweet stories about author's friendship with a donkey. Above my Spanish level and will have to read it again some day. Lovely prose where my understanding was not too foggy.</li>
<li><strong>Brodeckovo poročilo (Brodeck Report) by Manu Larcenet</strong>. A fantastic graphic novel based on a novel by Philippe Claudel about difference and intolerance in a village near French-German border soon after WW2. Wonderfully drawn and impactful, it would be difficult to imagine it is not doing justice to original material which I have not read yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Architecting-Angular-Applications-Redux-RxJS/dp/1787122409/">Architecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJS, and NgRx</a> by Christoffer Noring. I have mixed feelings about this book. It is a good introduction to the topic, but I am still not persuaded about the approach. I have some qualms about organisation of the content as the book seems to be confused about who its audience is and certainly about many technical mistakes in code samples, but I would still recommend it as the best introduction to those who need to get acquainted with its topic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mistletoe-Murder-Other-Stories/dp/1101973803/">The Mistletoe Murder and Other Stories</a> by P.D. James</strong>. Judging by this book P.D. James deserved her high reputation. Crime stories best read around Christmas, all of them superbly conceived and written. Highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>My plan for this year is simply to get into a habit of reading books again with a healthy mixture of fiction and non-fiction. No particular number in mind, but single digit would be disappointing as it would mean I again wasted too much stuff on mostly short fluff found on the net.</p>
<p>It would be great, if I managed to rise to last year’s challenge of reading a book in each to me  familiar language, but probably won’t.</p>
