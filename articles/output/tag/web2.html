 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison, though:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.

   <li>
    Games are good at

    . Stories are good at empathy.
   </li>
   <li>
    Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Games are external — they are about people’s actions. Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal — they are about people’s emotions and thoughts.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A lot has been said in last couple of years about
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic" rel="wikipedia" title="Game mechanic">
   game mechanics
  </a>
  and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or customization?
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually means it wants to provoke action on visitor’s part. Intended action may be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or subscribe to blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction with a visitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull, but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage" title="Amazon">

  </a>
  presents other side of spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren’t there to read an item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items, reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn’t be used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you make a more informed decision on what and when to include.

  As I am leaving on a short vacation that will probably take me off grid for few days, there is still a time for a hopefully short, but definitely last post of this year. I don’t like how registration forms ask me twice for password and I think I can offer a better way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most registration forms these days still want you to type password of your choice twice. They probably do it to reduce risk of mistyping it. I deeply dislike Facebook, but I think this is one thing it
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Registration form on Facebook's homepage">
   got right
  </a>
  . You only have to do it once. Those with FB accounts can see this in action if they log out for a moment and visit front page.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are several reasons why once is enough. First one is that every decent page provides a way to reset password in case you have forgotten it. So even if password was mistyped, it’s easy to reset it again to a different value. Second reason is that by now it’s quite well known that most people use a low single-digit number of passwords and don’t come up with a new one each time they are asked to do so. Hence it’s quite unlikely they’ll make an error now after so much practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third reason is that in most cases you can
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" title="Demonstration of show password switch">
   help them
  </a>
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" style="font-size: 29.25px; line-height: 42.75px;" title="Demonstration of show password switch">
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  When registration forms first appeared internet access was rare and expensive enough that most common environment in which it was used was work or school. It was therefore likely that when you were registering for a service, you weren’t alone and entered password had to be hidden from people around you. Today it’s probably opposite. Most of the time I am quite private and could see what I type with no additional security risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  So as in demo we could offer a switch that let visitors see what they are typing if they choose to do so. It should still be hidden by default, since we can’t really tell the environment visitor is in or if Javascript is available. It is always better to err on side of safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a side note for those who might have peaked at implementation. I’m replacing password input field because of Internet Explorer, which doesn’t tolerate type attribute change on input fields. Every other browser tested (FF, Opera, Safari and Chrome) would work perfectly fine by just switching field type from password to text.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyhow, that’s it for this year. If you leave a comment, which I hope you will, and I don’t answer, it’s because I lack Internet access.
