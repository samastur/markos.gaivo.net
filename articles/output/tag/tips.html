  It’s been a month since we returned from our  traveling around
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia">
   Bolivia
  </a>
  . It was the most exhausting trip I have ever done and I ended up so weak that what ought to be a minor cold landed me in bed for few days. Luckily this happened only
  <em>
   after
  </em>
  our return, but still I didn’t get to write this post then and I’ve been struggling to find time for it every since.
 </p>
 <p>

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not sure why I was so tired. We did spend quite a lot of time trekking, but not really more than we are used to. I suspect it had something to do with high altitude and sheer amount of information my brains tried to digest. A month of travel may sound long
  <sup>
   <a href="#bolivia-note-1" id="bolivia-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  , but it’s really too short to get to know a country especially one so big and unfamiliar as Bolivia. Best you can hope for is to learn enough to give your ignorance a bit of  a shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is also too short because you will need more time than you expect. One advice you hear often is that something will go wrong. It happened to us too and though you can be disappointed at times, you’ll mostly have fun, be amazed
  <sup>
   <a href="#bolivia-note-2" id="bolivia-2">
    [2]
   </a>
  </sup>
  and sometimes even shocked. Our schedule was packed and it will take me months to process all that we have seen and experienced, but I hope we can return soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finding reasons to visit Bolivia is easy. Finding help for organizing this trip may prove more difficult. Pick an agency and search will turn up somebody who had a horrible experience with them. Not us though. We met amazing people who really worked hard to make our trip unforgettable which leads me to real reason for writing this post.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you intend to go and would like some local help, here are our recommendations.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no shortage of hotels in La Paz and mid range
  <a href="http://www.hotelrosario.com/la-paz/">
   hotel Rosario
  </a>
  has deservedly consistently high reviews. It has great front desk staff (especially Ximenia), nice rooms and location. Dinners are consistently great too, but I would avoid lunch. Same kitchen but apparently different team and what you get might not be
  <em>
   exactly
  </em>
  what you ordered.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.america-ecotours.com/">
   America Tours
  </a>
  is a travel agency recommended by Lonely Planet which can help you organize your way around country. Speed with which they were able to organize alternatives to our cancelled our trip to Madidi (thanks Amazsonas for nothing) was simply amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people who visit Potosi stay in town. It’s certainly cheaper than alternatives, but if you can afford it, then a good place to stay is at
  <a href="http://www.hotelmuseocayara.com/">
   hotel museo Cayara
  </a>
  that is about half an hour drive away. Museum and a chance to talk to Arturo alone are worth it. Hacienda that has been there since 1557 is in the middle of beautiful nature and away of polluted surroundings of Potosi and is a popular destination for daily trips organized by travel agencies in Potosi (a good alternative for those on small budgets).
 </p>
 <p>
  Usual way of seeing the largest salt flat in world is to travel to Uyuni and take a trip with one of many unreliable operators who are often hostages to their prone-to-drinking drivers. I believe it is better to travel to Tupiza (if you have time) and take a slightly longer tour. We had really good experience with
  <a href="http://www.tupizatours.com/index.php">
   Tupiza Tours
  </a>
  , but my advice to those who prefer email for arranging their trips, is to start at least a couple of weeks before they go because girls at Tupiza Tours seem to be swamped in work. Or call them if you can. If you pick them, then ask for Hernan Cordova, the best off-road driver we have ever met (and Spanish speaking guide), and Jeaneth Menchaca Condori if you need an English speaking guide. They went above and beyond their duty, really made every effort to anticipate our wishes and needs and had an unlimited amount of patience.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many agencies in La Paz that will take you trekking and prices vary significantly.
  <a href="http://www.andeansummits.com/">
   Andean Summits
  </a>
  is certainly not among the cheapest, but they are very professional and accommodating (like with our last minute request to change dates of our trek). Ask also for Gustavo Miranda Hulliri, who apart from being a great cook and camp manager also seems to know every path there is. This can be really useful if you, say, get really weak because you were throwing up all previous day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tourist guides in Bolivia have to be certified. Most of them studied tourism and are very good. Still we were especially impressed by Julia Catunta Janco who consistently surprised us with showing us things we wouldn’t even think of asking. She would be our first choice unless you go climbing. Contact me if you need her email address.
 </p>
 <p>
  One sure sign that your guide was really good is that saying goodbye feels like leaving a good friend. It is a feeling we didn’t expect before, but felt repeatedly once we were there. Life is too short to visit every place we would like to see, but I still have no doubt that we will return. I hope this post has been of some help to those of you who might be thinking of visiting Bolivia.

   Popular stereotype of a Japanese tourist used to be someone who took pictures non-stop. Someone explained to me once that this is a necessary memory aid for short vacations with packed schedule because it can help you recall and organize memories later when you’re back. I don’t know if this is true for Japanese, but it is certainly true for me.

   I knew Bolivia was rich in minerals, but I had no idea that there were so many mines which often exist in the most inhospitable places. Even big scale mining (such as for silver around Potosi) is usually done individually and this is even more true for small mines where there may be only 10 or so miners risking their life. It’s very hard and often short way to live that can still be better than alternatives.

  I attended OpenData hackday previous weekend where we tried to create a website inspired by
  <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">
   theyworkforyou.com
  </a>
  . We didn’t quite achieve our goal, but a lot was done by everyone and we had fun. At least I did and I am certain we will release the first version soon (before the end of October, mark my words).
 </p>
 <p>
  Not releasing our website still bothered me and I’ve been thinking about it since, contemplating what we did right and what I did wrong.﻿ I hope this rumination can be of use to others who may be thinking about organizing or attending such an event. If you already have and have some tips to share or simply disagree with something I said, then please leave a comment at the bottom.

 <h2>
  Planning
 </h2>
 <p>
  It is
  <a href="http://neoacademic.com/2011/09/22/unfolding-the-ikea-effect-why-we-love-the-things-we-build/" title="IKEA effect">
   important to finish
  </a>
  something. Having something at least a bit useful or fun gives everyone involved a sense of achievement and provides a better motivation for further work. To avoid problems with too many ideas started and none finished, we suggested to work only on ideas that have at least 3 volunteers. We also created a wiki where everyone could add their idea and volunteer for projects they liked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think strongly suggesting at least 3 volunteers per project idea had an effect of ending up with just one idea. Not our intention, nor necessarily a problem, but it’s worth keeping in mind. We all tend to take the path of least resistance when not really committed to an idea and joining is easier than finding an idea AND people to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  However if you do come up with an idea, then here are a few things you might keep in mind:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Self-sustaining projects win.
  </strong>
  Even with best intentions you will probably run out of time for your project eventually. So projects that can be finished or which can be run by a community with few development and administration resources are less likely to end in failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Strip it to bare essentials
  </strong>
  , but keep a list of things you’d like to add if you had more time or help. I knew that we couldn’t build theyworkforyou in a day, but my planned version was still too grandiose. I should stop only when removing anything would reduce it to useless. Another reason for this is that I also often overestimate my free time — important for projects that will continue after hackday.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Check if you have data you need
  </strong>
  . First check for completeness, since missing parts might significantly affect feasibility of your project (especially if they are needed for a stripped down version). If you plan to scrap data from a public source (instead of using API or something you already have), then scrape it well before the event. Site may not be available when you need it or, as it was our experience, it can be frustratingly slow. Perception of speed is relative, but downloads can always go slower than even the pessimist in you would make you believe. I learned on hackday that I was planning to use a non-existing data.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Check the quality of your data,
  </strong>
  don’t only glance at it. Spend some time getting to know it and think about how you will clean it up. I knew our data was in an atrocious state, but I was still widely optimistic. Luckily
  <a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/" title="Tomaž's blog">
   Tomaž
  </a>
  is a seasoned data wrangler that can deal with crap input.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Have a detailed TODO list
  </strong>
  . Not only will it give you a better picture of scope, it also makes it easier to divide work to unexpected volunteers. Mark what is necessary and what would be nice to have. Also pay attention to skills needed for finishing each task.
  <a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org/~hruske/blog/" title="Gašper's blog">
   Gašper
  </a>
  put a lot of effort into our to-do list and I haven’t. We could certainly achieve more if it was clearer what needs to be done and if I could delegate better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Have a “roadmap”
  </strong>
  . Not every task can be done in parallel so identify and mark task dependencies. It may also be quicker if multiple developers extract different information from the same piece of data then for everyone to wait on one person to extract all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Prepare hosting beforehand.
  </strong>
  If you plan to host a website, then set up
  <em>
   and test
  </em>
  at least essential parts before the event. Day passes too quickly even if you don’t waste time setting up the environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ditto for development environment.
  </strong>
  How many people do you think will or can work on project(s)? Are they all familiar with tools you intend to use? Do you have adequate resources?
 </p>
 <p>
  I expected time constraints to prevent us from auditing code for exploits, so we opted for bitbucket which gives you private repositories for free. But we had to juggle around its limitation of 5 developers per repository and choice of mercurial as DVCS. Having them private turned out to be unimportant.
 </p>
 <p>
  So pick tools most are comfortable with and set up your own server (before the event of course) if publicly available options might not be good enough. You want everyone to start contributing as soon and as easily as possible.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Running event
 </h2>
 <p>
  Our hackday was as open as it gets. We used
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">
   Eventbrite
  </a>
  for registration, but didn’t enforce it so everyone who came was welcome no matter how long they stayed. It’s fantastic when people show up offering free help and it would be plain crazy to turn them away. There is always something they can do no matter what their skill set.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are a few tips I wish I followed:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lead.
  </strong>
  Self-organization is great, but the likelihood of misunderstandings and duplication of effort quickly increases with the size of a group. If you have dependencies in your project roadmap, then it’s also important that showstopper tasks are done before those that rely on them. That’s why someone usually has to lead development and if a project doesn’t have that someone, you either have to find or be him.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Talk to everyone.
  </strong>
  Find out what they are doing or what they would like to do. Find out also how long they intend to stay, since that might limit the choice of suitable tasks. Talking is pretty much the only reliable way to find these things out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even better might be to have short group meetings throughout the day for everyone to catch up and I regret I didn’t think of this then. This however doesn’t absolve you from talking, especially if contributors are free to come and go whenever they please as they might have not been around yet the last time you were catching up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Delegate.
  </strong>
  As much as possible to as many as possible. Don’t play a hero trying to do too much. You can always pick another task later or help someone with theirs if you finish too soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact it’s probably better to help less experienced members with their tasks than doing whatever you are doing. Having a healthy contributing community is what makes or breaks voluntary projects so nurturing one is even more important than finishing the first version. This goes even more so for projects that can’t ever be really finished.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Morning after
 </h2>
 <p>
  Hackday is over and everyone has gone for a beer. Hopefully everyone is happy with results, but ambitious projects almost by definition can’t be finished in a day and the next morning it was amazing to see people continuing hacking where they left off the day before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not every hacking community is as engaged as ours. However we all have more or less the same needs. It’s nice to hear our work was appreciated and even better that it mattered. We like to help if we are not alone and if it is clear how. Thus I found email sent by Gašper a few days later a pitch perfect post-hackday message. He first thanked everyone involved, then listed what each and all together achieved and ended by what he intends to do next.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this is it. A long, but not exhaustive run through my experience of our last hackday which also took way longer to write than I expected. It’s time to go back to hacking!
