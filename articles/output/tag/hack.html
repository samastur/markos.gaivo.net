  I do practically all of my work on Sony VAIO notebook I bought 3 years ago. I picked it because it was very light (less than 1.5kg), small, had great screen, keyboard and battery that seemed to last forever (around 11 hours without WiFi and about 8 with it). I still love this machine, but it has a remarkable design failure. Let’s see if you can spot it on this picture?
 </p>
 <p class="aligncenter">
  <img alt="Detail of Sony VAIO showing power on/off switch" class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/switch.jpg" title="Power on/off switch"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  That glassy looking button is an on/off switch. It responds to light pressure and it protrudes from notebook even when lid is closed. What could possibly go wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while I got tired of my notebook getting turned off while I carried it and made what I believed would be a temporary fix until I figure out something better
  <sup>
   <a href="#pimp-notebook-1-note" id="pimp-notebook-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . A cap for button made out of layers of paper for sturdiness (I should at least use paperboard) glued together and reinforced with copious amounts of Scotch tape. It looked ugly, but mostly worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem with temporary fixes is that they tend to become permanent. I think this happens when they are too successful and remove too much pain, but it’s hard to find that sweet spot of enough uneasiness without actual aggravation. Maybe it doesn’t even exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I’ve been using it ever since with a firm intention to figure out a better way to fix it. I finally decided to draw what I need and print it at
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.shapeways.com" rel="homepage" title="Shapeways">
   Shapeways
  </a>
  <sup>
   <a href="#pimp-notebook-2-note" id="pimp-notebook-2">
    [2]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . Here are results:

  <img alt="3 switch protectors. Old one made out of paper and two new ones." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/protectors.jpg" title="Switch protectors - old and new"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  I made two (left is old paper one), because it takes them a while to print and deliver them to Europe, I had no experience with materials and they are relatively cheap. They also looked better before I sandpapered them somewhat for a better fit. In fact both of them were completely black.
 </p>
 <p>
  A couple of tips if you intend to use
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://sketchup.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google SketchUp">
   SketchUp
  </a>
  for drawing models. SketchUp was really made for drawing sketches of buildings so when you start it, you’ll see an image of a person (to help you scale your sketch). That image is an object and you have to delete it if you don’t want it to screw up your measurements in exported file. The other consequence of SketchUp purpose is that anything you draw has no depth. This didn’t matter to me since required thickness of protector cylinder was about the same as minimum thickness that 3D printer can print. If this is not true for you, then you’ll probably need to do some post-processing (search Shapeways for tutorials).
 </p>

  My notebook has been “on the road” and has performed admirably apart from a failed battery latch which forced me to now use a lower capacity battery (which still gets me through a typical conference day). But 3 years is forever for wandering notebook so it was no big surprise that frame of its screen eventually cracked. Superglue didn’t fix it and I was thinking about gluing a piece of wood or metal to screen for reinforcement, but I hate the idea of additional weight. It would also look awful.
 </p>
 <p>
  At about same time I was snooping around
  <a href="http://store.mozilla.org/">
   Mozilla store
  </a>
  to see if there was something I like which I could buy to support my favorite web project and discovered laptop skins. I was never a fan of covering my laptop with stickers from various startups (why would anyone want that?), but this was perfect. I’m not sure from what kind of material the skins are made of, but they are thin and don’t tear easily. With another layer of Scotch tape I got something that I think looks great and provides enough protection for a now more careful user:

 <p class="aligncenter">
  <img alt="Shows back of notebook with new skin and switch protector attached." class="aligncenter" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/final.jpg" title="New back of notebook and switch protector"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks great, right?

   I still find it amazing that this problem wasn’t caught before release.  Eventually they noticed it and later models got buttons that need more pressure to trigger and are better shielded from environment.

  Now that Mini Seedcamp in Ljubljana is behind me (an event that might warrant its own post), I finally have some time to write about
  <a href="http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/FrontPage">
   Open Hack 2009
  </a>
  . I’m sorry to say to those who didn’t go that this might have been the biggest mistake you’ll do this year. It was indeed awesome. Before I go on I would also like to thank people at Yahoo for really pulling no stops in making it great and to everyone who came, for being inspiring, helpful and generally fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">
   Fry
  </a>
  and I made two hacks, a website
  <a href="http://guesswhatthisis.appspot.com/">
   GuessWhatThisIs
  </a>
  based on an idea we brought to event (but no code), and a game
  <a href="http://friedcell.net/geopong/">
   GeoPong
  </a>
  that Fry thought of in wee hours of Sunday. GeoPong, best described as “
  <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/05/11/open-hack-london-2009-my-presentation-and-quick-review/" title="Link to quote">
   a quite irrelevant but lovely hack
  </a>
  “, doesn’t always work great (especially on non-FF browsers), nevertheless I am still amazed that we managed to build both, because we essentially did GuessWhatThisIs twice. Wifi didn’t work until later in the evening, so we built first version of the site with pieces of software we had on our machines an educated guess about APIs we needed but couldn’t access.
 </p>
 <p>
  Event was thoroughly documented on Flickr, Twitter and plethora of other websites, so I won’t dwell much on that. Instead I’ll mention couple of observations that albeit not new, I still found interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  First one is that team is absolutely everything. You can certainly do interesting stuff alone, but things really start happening if you have a good team. Working with talented and fun people mean ideas get fleshed out sooner, there’s little coordination and more things get done. If on top they are like Fry, who like a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell_Bunny">
   Duracell Bunny
  </a>
  just seems to keep going, you can finish projects you certainly would not otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hackday also provided another proof that all-nighters as development method are an idiotic idea. Most hackers, who certainly didn’t lack enthusiasm, fell asleep at some point during the night and those, like us, who didn’t, slowly fried our brains. Development slowed down to a glacial speed, code written was frankly embarassing and help was needed to resolve most basic problems. We spent more than 4 hours on GeoPong which normally shouldn’t take us more than half of one. Even worse from efficiency point of view was that Monday was gone too. All-nighter can be a fun thing to do once in a while, but it is really a crappy way to run a business.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end a small advice to organizers for next European event, on which I hope we won’t have to wait another two years. Try putting as much documentation and libraries on USB key as you can, so in case of wifi not working, we can still program with them instead of falling back to what we already intimately know or have on our machines.
