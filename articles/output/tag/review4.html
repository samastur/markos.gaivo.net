            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>2015 was a year of completely <a href="../2015-review.html">missed plans</a> and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.</p>
<p>We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.</p>
<p>I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. </p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: <em>Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).</li>
<li><a href="http://diytoolkit.org/">DIY Toolkit</a> by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/">Missing Person</a> by Patrick Modiano.</strong> The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/">Wyrd Sisters</a> by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/">Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</a> by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.</strong> Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/">The Shepherd's Crown</a> by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/">The Arab of the Future</a> by Riad Sattouf.</strong> A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058">Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration</a> by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).</li>
</ul>
<p>This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
<p>I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in its last month.</p>
<p>I have spent about a third of last year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin, confirmed that I am indeed in no way an equestrian person and culminating in my first visit to a doctor on my travels. Not only did I not "salvage summer" as <a href="../late-2014-review.html">I hoped</a>, I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some decidedly less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.</p>
<p>My family spent a lot of time in hospitals and I with them. Any time is really too much, but at least I can solace myself with good outcomes. Still, it would be great if none of us entered one next year.</p>
<p>There is no need to go through the list of things <a href="../late-2014-review.html">I planned</a> a year ago as I did none of them. Life intervened, but I also did not use first half of the year as well as I should. However last couple of months were great. Reader still lives only in my head, but I did finally rewrite image-diet which is now called <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet2">image-diet2</a> and is in pretty much everything better than previous version. </p>
<p>I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and by the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year). I do plan to deepen my knowledge of Python3, ES2015 and ES2016 now that I have more opportunity to use them.</p>
<p>It was a tumultuous year and yet I feel calmer than ever which I mostly attribute to <a href="http://www.tm.org/">TM</a>. It is difficult to judge its other effects on me as they are clearly not as pronounced, but feeling more peaceful even under stressful circumstances makes meditating worthwhile enough for me.</p>
<p>I do not know what to expect of 2016, but it feels seminal. The image stuck in my head for last couple of days was my first week at university. Totally clueless and wrong about where  life will take me, but knowing it will be different afterwards. In a way this year feels like one of last opportunities to <strong>easily</strong> redefine who I want to be.</p>
<p>The biggest change next year will be professional. I have happily worked for Aptivate for four years and hope to continue doing so in the future, but not solely. I will be available for freelance work. <a href="mailto:markos@gaivo.net">Talk to me</a> if you will need help from someone with <a href="http://si.linkedin.com/in/markosamastur">my background</a>.</p>
<p>Another goal for this year is to present a talk at a conference as I haven't done that in a while. "Competition" for slots at interesting ones is strong enough that giving even one will be a success.</p>
<p>Other than that I am trying too avoid being too ambitious with my plans as I expect this year to be busy as it is. I plan to do a <a href="../homeconf.html">homeconf</a> once per quarter and read more than I did this year. I will write publicly more as it would be difficult to write less and I am again not bereft of things to share (although most of them are not ready yet).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/samastur/vim-notebook">finally</a> hacked <a href="http://bitterjug.com/">Mark's</a> journal script to fit my needs. I can now summon it at any time and commit new entry without switching applications. My plan is mainly to jot down non-obvious problems and solutions I encounter, but I'd love to hear what others write in their work journals.</p>
<p>Spending few hours each month on tooling seems sensible. I have rejigged my set up late last year and difference is palpable. Development takes less effort with better results. Removing friction from doing the right thing is already a win, but if I can make it easier than doing wrong things, then that's golden.</p>
<p>In any case I have few firm plans for next year. Getting freelancing off the ground and presenting at conference should keep me busy enough. I expect to be overworked at least some of the time and yet it's been a while since I have felt so optimistic. Let's see how it goes.</p>

  Another year’s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining

  </a>
  (jump to 28:23 if it doesn’t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  I
  <a href="40.html">
   became 40
  </a>
  in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with
  <sup>
   <a href="#review-2014-1-note" id="review-2014-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am
  <strong>
   not
  </strong>
  emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes
  <sup>
   <a href="#review-2014-2-note" id="review-2014-2">
    [2]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and…), but I am becoming suspicious of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">
   quantified self
  </a>
  movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.

  If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is.

  . However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.

  In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.

  I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have”finished”

  against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery’s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.
 </p>
 <p>
  My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I’m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.
 </p>
 <p>
  My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.
 </p>
 <p>
  I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can’t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing “reader” as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It

   is
  </em>
  something to keep an eye on this year.
