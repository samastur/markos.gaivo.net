  When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly Google Reader users or at least that’s how I imagined them. I certainly was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Greader’s shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good time for late spring feed pruning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the time it was up again, Greader wasn’t anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.

  Google Reader for me was never just a way to plow through a large number of feeds, but also a database of important articles that I lovingly annotated with tags and notes when they still existed. Apparently I was in minority, judging by Reader clients and more importantly its own exporting tools which lets you take away most of your stuff, but not tagged items themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence I wrote a quick and dirty Python script which allows you to do just that using
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libgreader">
   libgreader
  </a>
  . You can find
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/GReader-hoover">
   it on Github
  </a>
  and it has few other features like exporting all feed articles. Who knows how long Feedburner will be around so next step will be resolving those links.
 </p>
 <p>
  My current backup amounts to almost 500MB so script is obviously useful to me. Hopefully it is also to others.  If you find bugs or data that is not exported, but should be, please do let me know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am also looking for a good alternative that is
  <strong>
   not hosted only
  </strong>
  service, supports archiving and can process most feeds. Currently I am biased to modifying Newsblur to support tagging and running my own instance, but I would definitely prefer to avoid this work if possible.
