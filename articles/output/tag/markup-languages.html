  After years of personal embarrassment I finally managed to update look and code of my website. This actually happened last week and I wanted to write this post sooner, but
  <a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si" title="Supervizor">
   other things
  </a>
  came in-between. There are still bugs I need to fix (iPad footer is better than it was, but not fine), but﻿ overall I’m pretty happy with how it turned out.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a second site I built using
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/" rel="homepage" title="media queries">
   media queries
  </a>
  and I learned lots. When I learn a bit more about mobile web, I might write a post about few gotchas for new developers, but this is not that post. This post is about
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  tag because it bugged me when I made that first design and I spent a remarkable amount of time on it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  My problem with it came down to its definition.
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  can be used only to mark up contact information about content’s author. In HTML 4 this was limited to authorship of whole page. For HTML5 it
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-address-element" title="Definition of &lt;address&gt; in HTML5 specification">
   was “widened”
  </a>
  to authorship of sectioning element like
  <code>
   &lt;article&gt;
  </code>
  (so if you have more than one article on page, each can contain its own, different, address for its author). You can’t however mark any address with it and after lots of searching I found
  <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-February/014023.html" title="Ian's message from February 2008">
   this old message
  </a>
  from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson" rel="wikipedia" title="Ian Hickson">
   Ian Hickson
  </a>
  which explains why (I’m not aware of any later clarifications).
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t agree with everything said. Mostly correct use is not necessarily a proof of well-designed element. My bet would be that
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  was a rather unknown tag exactly because of its limited use and was thus used mostly by those that dig deeper into standards, which sound also like people who care  how things are used as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still most points are valid. Loosening definition would make it less meaningful.
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" title="Specification of hCard microformat">
   There
  </a>
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/adr" title="Specification of adr microformat">
   are
  </a>
  microformats that you can use instead and most annoying problems (allowing only inline content) have been fixed. We also have better tools for parsing HTML so  it really doesn’t matter much if its definition feels completely right or not. It’s good enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end I still decided to mark my contact information on
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net">
   my homepage
  </a>
  with
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  anyhow (augmented with
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCard" rel="wikipedia" title="HCard">
   hCard
  </a>
  ), because I am after all the sole author of this website.

  It has been a busy week. We had a new release at
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com/" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta ltd.">
   Zemanta
  </a>
  , first big one that I was a part of. While things didn’t go as smoothly as we would hope, I think it has been a big success. I would like to thank all involved for their huge contribution and especially to my team, which never stops astonishing me. It’s a pleasure and a privilege to work with you all.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also made a small blunder with cursor moving while typing your post. Emptying your browser cache should remedy this. Please let me know if it doesn’t. Even though we are still in alpha, we don’t see this as an excuse for poor performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has been a release full of features, but two of them are especially dear to me even though I haven’t contributed much to either.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   clean HTML
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We heard numerous, quite correct complaints that HTML we insert in posts is not valid or nice enough. We did this partly because of honest mistakes on our part (e.g. putting IDs on elements that can appear more than once per page) or because it is really difficult to insert an HTML fragment that will look OK everywhere, no matter the blogging platform or visual template used.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end we came to conclusion that it is not feasible for us to do this, so we now offer you a choice. If you do nothing, you will still get the same styled HTML for related articles. But if you chose a clean xHTML option in preferences, which can be find below articles list, you will get a clean, unstyled xHTML which you can style to your liking. We still haven’t settled on final HTML for it, so any
  <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/zemanta" title="Zemanta support forum">
   feedback
  </a>
  would be more than welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reblog
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The other feature I am really fond of is
  <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/reblog/" title="Reblog's homepage">
   reblog
  </a>
  . Using Zemanta added a little orange image at the end of the post. It was basically a small ad for us, which we really appreciated. This ad has been replaced with new image that offers your visitors an easy way to continue discussion on their blogs by choosing a paragraph from your story to quote and adding their thoughts before publishing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can see an example on this very post. Just press reblog button at the end. We are continuously discovering and fixing quirks in parsing HTML text out there, but if you find a new one, please let us know.
 </p>
 <p>
  So these were my favorite features. What were yours?
