  I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy

  </a>
  user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900">
   Nokia N900
  </a>
  is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.

  , but there are applications or features I miss. This post is a reminder to me on what I might do if I find more time. Since list is too long for me to do everything (unless I suddenly win lottery), feel free to pick an idea you like and run with it. Just let me know afterwards where I can see results of your work or participate in development.

   Offline Wikipedia.

  When I am not behind a computer or reading, I like to be outdoors and even though cheap always available Internet was supposed to be here any day now, I regularly find myself information hungry in places with a very slow or no Internet connection. N900 with SD card could pretty much store everything I wanted and building an app that process and display information from
  <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/" title="Wikipedia dumps starting page">

  doesn’t look like a too difficult task.

  <strong>
   Better dictionary for Maemo.
  </strong>
  QStarDict port
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is great and it has become one of my favorite applications. However its user interface suffers from being a direct port of a desktop version one and could be improved with one that wastes less space and is orientation aware. Reading dictionary is one of few things I wish I could do in portrait mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Web platform for Maemo.
  </strong>
  Wouldn’t it be great if you could build Maemo applications with web technologies?
  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qtwebkit.html" title="Link to QtWebKit documentation">
   QtWebKit
  </a>
  is a great place to start and I am certain I could expose new functionality through
  <em>
   addToJavascriptWindowObject
  </em>
  of
  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwebframe.html" title="Link to QWebFrame documentation">
   QWebFrame
  </a>
  class. Beside exposing this stuff I would also like to create tools and interfaces for developers and users alike with which they can easily package a web application as a standalone Maemo application or in case of users, turn a website into an application (I know you can add a bookmark to a website but it is not quite the same thing).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/" title="Caffeine for Mac">
    Caffeine
   </a>
   for N900.
  </strong>
  I would like to pick
  <em>
   “Switch profile to silent for &lt;x time&gt;”
  </em>
  and know N900 will turn back normal profile when that time period expires. I always forget to turn ringing back on after I leave cinema.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Monitor unknown calls.
  </strong>
  I don’t want to pollute my address book with every phone number under the sun, but I would appreciate if I could get a hint if I ever talked or called the number in question. Bonus points for using public phone books to fetch name for given number and parsing number for clues (which country or part of it is call coming from).
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not a complete list of things I want, but rest are mostly feature requests (except email client which currently really kind of sucks). For example I wish calendar had support for
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" rel="wikipedia" title="CalDAV">
   CalDAV
  </a>
  or PDF viewer for screen rotate, search and fit to width.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am aware that Maemo should be called MeeGo now, but a habit of years can’t be changed in few weeks. I searched for above applications and didn’t find them, but if you know of any I missed, then please let me know.

  Title says it. A month is enough time to get a better understanding of the device and to get asked repeatedly about my impressions. Many have wrote theirs, so I doubt I will be telling anything really new. Before I go on, a short disclaimer, since my writings on this blog stay around longer than might be sensible.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wrote this post at the start of February 2010. I believe everything I write about technology to be hopelessly out of date after 6 months, but I expect this article will be obsolete even sooner. So by the time you got around reading this, most of my gripes might not even be true anymore.

  is an uncut diamond. A wonderful thing made by talented designers that has quite a few rough edges, not all of them in device. I wouldn’t recommend it to most people, but to some of you it might become your favorite computer. It goes with me almost anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want a rock solid phone, then this device is not for you. I was unlucky to be in minority of people who experienced constant reboots. By constant I mean few times every hour.? My
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia">
   Nokia
  </a>
  also lacked a 2GB partition, which meant I was constantly running out of space in which to install applications. Both of this problems have since been fixed. I still have a problem with
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM" rel="wikipedia" title="GSM">
   GSM
  </a>
  connection occasionally completely dying, which I can fix only by manual reboot. I’m personally not bothered since I don’t use it as phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand updates to software are regular, with one major firmware update already, that fixed some of my problems (reboot). Annoyances of today might literally be gone by tomorrow and thus my disclaimer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know how much effort goes in good software and don’t want to be too negative, but email really does suck for IMAP users. Not only doesn’t it cache headers, so if you have a slow connection and a big Inbox, get used to waiting. You also can’t set sent mail, drafts or trash folders which makes it useless to me for anything but reading email. Even worse, it creates its own folders (like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch">
   iPod touch
  </a>
  ) to make a mess in your account. I am all for simplicity and avoiding needless configuration options, but it could at least get a list of folders and compare Levenshtein’s distance to common names (Sent, Sent mail…).
 </p>
 <p>
  Gecko (Mozilla) based browser though is great, in my opinion much better than iPod’s and I completely switched my mobile browsing to N900. I am biased since unlike many I never was fond of constant zooming in and out (with pinching). My opinion might have been different if my eye-sight was poorer and I needed to zoom more.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are a Linux user or appreciate freedom, then it’s difficult to find a better mobile device. N900 is a Linux machine which happens to also be a phone and you have complete access to everything. There is a store (Ovi) and app manager, but you can install and run anything willing to run without permission from anybody. Terminal is loaded by default together with tools needed to prod into the system and root is one package installation away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dislike fixed space of iPod. N900 is only slightly better. You can expand it with SD cards, but you have to open battery cover. It looks so fragile that I don’t intend to actually do this unless absolutely necessary. Speaking of storage, as a programmer I can understand why applications can use only 2GB of it, but as user it simply looks daft.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pair of contact and conversations applications is absolutely brilliant. Instant messaging, Skype and SMS are superbly integrated and they also feed contact application with information about your buddies found on those networks.? Install Hermes and you can update it with data from Twitter and Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screen has higher resolution than iPod’s, but physically same (small) size, which means I’ll keep reading PDFs on my 770. Since it’s resistive instead of capacitive, it needs more pressure than iPod’s, but works better at -12 degrees centigrade (
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/4268784785/" title="French Alps - photo taken by N900">

  </a>
  was taken with my gloves on).
 </p>
 <p>
  Maemo has a very active and generally supportive community, but some members can also be
  <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6334#c19">
   needlessly unfriendly
  </a>
  . Just because you know where everything is and have seen certain faux pas 100 times before, it doesn’t mean either is true for a new N900 owner with a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  N900 RUNS PYTHON, which was my main reason for preferring it over an
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://code.google.com/android/" rel="homepage" title="Android">
   Android
  </a>
  phone. Documentation is a bit all over the place, not always current and I still haven’t found information about how to control built in cameras, but I am an optimist that this will be sorted out soon and that documentation will improve as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I compared N900 with diamond, but maybe a better comparison would be a sports car. If you want a polished, sedated experience then N900 is certainly not for you (yet). But if you are a tinkerer who doesn’t mind rough edges in exchange for freedom to make it do almost anything, then you should give it a spin.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is so much more that could be said, but big picture wouldn’t change much. I haven’t talked much about UI since I simply couldn’t do it justice in few sentences. On the whole it works fine and multitasking is really great even though I think iPhone/iPad’s switch-to-where-you-were model is in my experience rarely a problem and wouldn’t be surprised if it was here to stay.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there is anything about it you would like to know, then please ask and I’ll try to respond to it promptly.
