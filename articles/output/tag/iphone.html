  I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy

  user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900">
   Nokia N900
  </a>
  is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.

  It’s been a month since I got an
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" rel="wikipedia" title="IPod Touch">
   iPod touch
  </a>
  as a present and I’ve been using it regularly since. I still have and use both a
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia">

  </a>
  N65 phone and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet">
   Nokia N770 tablet
  </a>
  , but use of later has been diminished in last month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iPod touch experience
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t help not to think of Touch as basically this decade’s Palm organizer. Thin widget with pleasant user experience that can be extended with myriad of applications, whose developers are — judging by iPhone versions — limited not by their imagination, but with device capabilities and limited expandability.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still don’t like its on-screen keyboard and wish I had at least something like
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)">
   Graffiti
  </a>
  . Hence I don’t write on it anything longer than two sentences and together with lack of camera, built-in microphone, GPS, Bluetooth or even just self-made software, it makes Touch a read-mainly device. Consumer device would be another, more ghastly, but appropriate description.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a side note, even my now aged N770 tablet is more friendly to creators and hence I still find use for it. I just don’t want to browse web on it because of its very very dated browser that can’t be updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, even with annoying limitations I like iPod touch a lot. It’s hard not to with its polished interface and an
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" rel="homepage" title="App Store">
   App Store
  </a>
  that is probably its killer application. Choice of applications in Slovenia is more limited than in USA, but still very wide and downloading them is so easy and cheap, you might have to fight against developing an addiction to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   So what about Nokia?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mobile devices space has become really interesting in last year. iPhone, iPod touch, Android with G1 and upcoming Palm Pre are finally bringing experience on web and otherwise, that we were promised years ago. But what this list lacks is any gadgets from Nokia.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like Nokia. They had friendliest phones that are remarkably open in industry that likes to control everything. I think their tablets are great, even with shortcomings that should be resolved by now. But even with lots of innovation I get an impression that they are lagging behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a complete outsider who only passingly follows what is happening in mobile industry, I can only ignorantly speculate about its reasons and plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe first problem for Nokia is that unlike
  <a href="http://www.palm.com/">
   Palm
  </a>
  ,
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com" rel="homepage" title="Apple">
   Apple
  </a>
  or even
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://google.com" rel="homepage" title="Google">
   Google
  </a>
  it’s not a niche player and tries to build phone for every possible user. It releases them too often. Taken together it is no wonder that just Nokia Europe
  <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products">
   lists
  </a>
  115 devices that are either selling now, were recently or will be in near future.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s too many devices, each with slightly different software, that create a very fragmented market. In such environment you can’t really hope that application would be pushing phones capabilities which aren’t there in most cases. Hence applications Nokia offers are not nearly as exciting as what Apple has.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next problem presents development environment, which is simply awful.
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.symbian.com" rel="homepage" title="Symbian">
   Symbian
  </a>
  might have been a nice platform back when, but its time has passed and I doubt open-sourcing it will help. Java hardly works better, but it’s probably a bit nicer to use even though it feels slower. Python is nice for tinkering, but not really an option until it becomes pre-installed. There’s also a web runtime, which is mostly missing. Few phones support it and only one phone available can use it for something more significant than a window to web.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much of what I just said is not true for tablets, but historically they didn’t seem to get much love from company. Too bad, since I think they are one of the most exiciting things Nokia has.
 </p>
 <p>
  I do remain an optimist. Purchase and relicensing of
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/" rel="homepage" title="Qt (toolkit)">
   Qt
  </a>
  together with its upcoming S60 version signals that company is aware of development problems. Qt also offers a possibility of a framework that could be used everywhere and hopefully this will include Fremantle. Generally I don’t put too much faith in rumors, but some of them give credible hints that next tablet could be even better than an already great N810. If it also brings a distribution model comparable to App Store and a bit more polish, then it could be a big success even with non-geeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what they need to do in my opinion is spend less time trying to build all encompassing services like
  <a href="http://www.ovi.com/">
   Ovi
  </a>
  and spend more effort in building amazing devices that integrate well with what is already out there. And by integration I don’t mean an app hidden in some folder on phone. Upload to
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">
   Flickr
  </a>
  should be available right after you took a photo. I also wish they didn’t try to leverage existing platform and users so much and were more daring and forward looking. If platform you have is stopping you from developing a phone you want, then find or develop a better one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until then I am sticking with what I got. A great phone for my needs that few match and a couple of nice tablets.
