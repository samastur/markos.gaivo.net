    I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regretfully I don’t have time to build this and it wouldn’t scale (I’m curious why Akismet doesn’t do something like that). So following Tomaž’s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don’t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn’t take more than a couple of weeks.
   </p>
   <p>
    Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.

    When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly Google Reader users or at least that’s how I imagined them. I certainly was.
   </p>
   <p>
    Greader’s shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good time for late spring feed pruning.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the time it was up again, Greader wasn’t anymore.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.
