   Update 2:
  </strong>
  Tickets are now
  <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">
   on sale
  </a>
  and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update
  </strong>
  : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
 </p>
 <p>
  I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no good way of contacting organizers
  <sup>
   <a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  and not much travel information either on
  <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">
   the DjangoCon’s website
  </a>
  or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
  <strong>
   er
  </strong>
  , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
 </p>
 <p>
  No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.
