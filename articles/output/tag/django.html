   Update 2:
  </strong>
  Tickets are now
  <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">
   on sale
  </a>
  and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update
  </strong>
  : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
 </p>
 <p>
  I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no good way of contacting organizers
  <sup>
   <a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  and not much travel information either on
  <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">
   the DjangoCon’s website
  </a>
  or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
  <strong>
   er
  </strong>
  , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
 </p>
 <p>
  No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.

  I like
  <a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails">
   easy-thumbnails
  </a>
  and use it often in my Django projects, but I wished for a long time that its
  <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">
   PIL
  </a>
  generated thumbnails would be smaller. That’s why I wrote
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">
   image-diet
  </a>
  , a drop-in extension for those easy-thumbnails users who use file system for storing images. Images remain visually the same, but can be significantly smaller (mine by more than 50% but your mileage my vary).
 </p>
 <p>
  This matters because images are together with Javascript main cause for ever larger page sizes which leads to slower websites, especially in low-bandwidth environments. But really, don’t we all want our websites to be as fast as possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">
   image-diet
  </a>
  was inspired by
  <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">
   ImageOptim
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/Kilian/Trimage">
   Trimage
  </a>
  and I’m grateful to authors of both. It uses jpegtran, Jpegoptim, Gifsicle, OptiPNG, AdvanceCOM PNG and Pngcrush to do the heavy work of squeezing redundant bytes. Getting them should be easy as they are part of Ubuntu distribution and can be installed on Mac with brew. For more information please check documentation or ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would love to hear any comments and ideas you may have, even more so if you try it.

  A class of bugs I really dislike debugging are those that depend on specific data and affect only a very small subset or just one user. Things could sometimes be fixed so much faster if you could just log in as him to see what is happening. Sometimes this is exactly what we do
  <strong>
   with his explicit permission
  </strong>
  , but I really dislike asking for passwords.
 </p>
 <p>
  First it inconveniences user. He has to come up with either a new good password or go through two password changes. Second it implicitly teaches wrong behavior. Passwords simply should never be revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  That is why I wrote
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/Impostor" title="Impostor's home at GitHub">
   Impostor
  </a>
  , a Django app that allows staff members (and only them) to login with their own credentials as a different user. Idea is not mine (kudos goes to
  <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201008/django_superuser_login_trapdoor.html" title="Ned's post where idea comes from">
   Ned Batchelder
  </a>
  ), but I like it. To discourage abuse every such authentication is recorded and can be seen in Django admin interface, but can not be altered from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  So how does it work in practice?
 </p>
 <p>
  Lets say that I would need to log in as user
  <em>
   fry
  </em>
  . To do this I would enter as my username
  <em>
   markos as fry,
  </em>
  provide my password and voila, I’m him. This has been recorded so anyone with access to ImpostorLog part in admin can see all such cases, mine included.
 </p>
 <p>
  Impostor may also ease your development by removing need to remember different passwords for testing. This is usually not a problem unless you happen to develop with fake data but real accounts. Like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And again for morally challenged out there:
  <strong>
   you should never login as somebody else without his explicit permission
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update
  </strong>
  : Thanks Ross for reminding me where idea came from. I updated text accordingly.
