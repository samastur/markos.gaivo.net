            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Couple of years ago I hacked together a small Django app called <a href="http://">image-diet</a> which automatically compresses images processed by Easy Thumbnails as they are uploaded to a website. Its code was atrocious with configuration for external tools baked in, it only worked with <a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails">Easy Thumbnails</a> and Python2 and...I could go on, but it worked and at <a href="http://aptivate.org">Aptivate</a> we have been using it successfully ever since.</p>
<p>Well, I finally found time and rewrote the whole thing. New version is now called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet2">image-diet2</a> because it is completely backwards incompatible and I screwed up versioning of the original one. Mea culpa.</p>
<p>It's implemented as a Django storage backend augmenting default one, but can easily be added as a mixin to any other so it should work no matter which tool or backend you use to upload files. Supporting new compression tools or changing configuration of existing does not require a new release or poking in virtualenv anymore. It is better <a href="https://travis-ci.org/samastur/image-diet2">tested</a>, <a href="http://image-diet2.readthedocs.org/">documented</a> and is not limited to 2.x branch of Python anymore. You really should give it a try.</p>
<p>image-diet2 is actually a thin Django wrapper around separately packaged <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyimagediet">pyimagediet</a> that actually process files. My hope is that others may find it useful enough to use it on non-Django projects. It also comes with a tool to compress images and generate configuration file tailored to your system. If you can think of anything else that would make integration even easier, then please let me know.</p>
<p>There are few bits still missing, but functionality is mostly complete. What I plan to do next is to test different configurations to find how well they work and what are their tradeoffs. Prior useful work such as <a href="http://www.css-ig.net/png-tools-overview">this</a> exists, but I'd like tests to be more expansive and in reusable format. They need to be easily replicable by anyone as their versions of processing tools might give different results than mine.</p>

  <strong>
   Update 2:
  </strong>
  Tickets are now
  <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">
   on sale
  </a>
  and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update
  </strong>
  : I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).
 </p>
 <p>
  I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no good way of contacting organizers
  <sup>
   <a href="#djangocon2014-note-1" id="djangocon2014-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  and not much travel information either on
  <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">
   the DjangoCon’s website
  </a>
  or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don’t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  First transport. It is not organizer’s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap
  <strong>
   er
  </strong>
  , but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.
 </p>
 <p>
  No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn’t and it won’t.

  I like
  <a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails">
   easy-thumbnails
  </a>
  and use it often in my Django projects, but I wished for a long time that its
  <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">
   PIL
  </a>
  generated thumbnails would be smaller. That’s why I wrote
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">
   image-diet
  </a>
  , a drop-in extension for those easy-thumbnails users who use file system for storing images. Images remain visually the same, but can be significantly smaller (mine by more than 50% but your mileage my vary).
 </p>
 <p>
  This matters because images are together with Javascript main cause for ever larger page sizes which leads to slower websites, especially in low-bandwidth environments. But really, don’t we all want our websites to be as fast as possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">
   image-diet
  </a>
  was inspired by
  <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">
   ImageOptim
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/Kilian/Trimage">
   Trimage
  </a>
  and I’m grateful to authors of both. It uses jpegtran, Jpegoptim, Gifsicle, OptiPNG, AdvanceCOM PNG and Pngcrush to do the heavy work of squeezing redundant bytes. Getting them should be easy as they are part of Ubuntu distribution and can be installed on Mac with brew. For more information please check documentation or ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would love to hear any comments and ideas you may have, even more so if you try it.
