    I don’t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to

    I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn’t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.

    We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don’t, you really ought to find something. I’ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you’ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.
   </p>
   <p>
    I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can – in time and geography. I haven’t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.

    I am not much of a
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="My YouTube channel">
     YouTube user
    </a>
    , but I have recently started to upload some of my work
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur" title="my demos on youtube">
     there
    </a>
    . You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes for products that may never be (especially if you are a
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.zemanta.com" rel="homepage" title="Zemanta">
     Zemanta
    </a>
    user).
   </p>
   <p>
    I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to our users so please tell us what you think.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is also a good time to mention that I don’t lead front-end team at Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our users more deeply than anybody else.
