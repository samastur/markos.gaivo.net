            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../the-books-i-read-in-2021.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to The books I read in 2021">The books I read in 2021</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p><a href="../books-i-read-in-2020.html">A year ago</a> I expected to read few books in 2021 and I definitely have “achieved” that for the same reasons as I did the last time. I read exactly as few books as in 2020 and even though I had only two reading goals for 2021, I managed to fail both.</p>
<p>I read one fiction book and it wasn’t a great match. Enough people I like with more clout recommend Niven’s book that there’s little harm in me not joining. If we are friends, then it’s probably not for you either (but I could be wrong).</p>
<p>The other three I read for work and I would recommend each of them highly to those interested in their topics. That is especially true for <em>Inclusive Components</em> which would get its own post if I trusted myself to find time writing it. <em>Every</em> web frontend engineer should read and think about it, but I would also recommend it to everyone who works with them or needs to consider web UI.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kill-Your-Friends-John-Niven/dp/0061690619/">Kill Your Friends</a> by John Niven. Rare books can stand the test of time and current personal mood. This is not such book, but I suspect I would enjoy it and its humour more if I read it when it came out. Last two years especially did not cultivate in me an appetite for despicable psychopaths without any redeeming qualities.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-dp-1491973897/dp/1491973897/">The Manager's Path</a> by Camille Fournier. A concise introduction to engineering management ladder, from tech lead to CTO with lots of helpful advice for each role. A useful read both for those who want to learn about expectations of each role when considering their career choices as those who already perform them and might need some friendly advice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://book.inclusive-components.design/">Inclusive Components </a> by Heydon Pickering</strong>. I bought a printed version of this book because I expected it to have a lasting value and it does. Some small bits have been obsoleted, there are parts I disagree with and I find the chapter about tables weak compared to others, but it's a fantastic book, a goldmine of insights, techniques and genuinely thought provoking ideas.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">High Output Management</a> by Andrew S. Grove. When reading early chapters I didn't understand why it is so highly regarded, but I changed my mind before half way through. It reads as a textbook from a practitioner, building on concepts and ideas from earlier chapters, focusing on building a mental framework to use instead of tips for specific problems. Still relevant after decades in "print".</li>
</ul>
<p>The circumstances and reasons that led to my abysmal reading record of last two years have not really changed, but my outlook has. I feel more thirsty for reading than I’ve felt in a long time and double digit number of books read does not feel unachievable. Of course, aiming for a healthy split between fiction and non-fiction. The list itself is hazy, but I want to read one of the earlier Pratchett’s and god willing, I’ll try not to read any books on management.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I started few books in 2020 and finished even fewer. I read obsessively, but once 2020 happened it was dominated by COVID-19 related research and information. Somewhere in late February or early March I also made a conscious decision to effectively ignore books this year and focus my attention on activities with less individual positive mental health effects.</p>
<p>None of the books I did manage to read is bad so they all point to Amazon’s smile (well, except the content strategy one). As charity benefits are minuscule I should find a good source not owned by Amazon. Hopefully next year. I recommend those in bold and especially Muriel Spark’s.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Ayoade-Top-Richard/dp/0571339131/">Ayoade On Top</a> by Richard Ayoade. A book about a movie only Ayoade, me and a handful other people saw. An argument for movie's greatness that is a fun reading for fans of Ayoade and his humour and probably not much fun for others. I enjoyed it greatly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Girls-Slender-Means-Directions-Classic/dp/081121379X/">The Girls of Slender Means</a> by Muriel Spark</strong>. I was drawn to this book by its title and sold on it by its brilliant first page. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am by this relatively short, but immensely rich book exemplified by its comic and with multiple meanings layered title.</li>
<li><a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy">The Elements of Content Strategy</a> by Erin Kissane. I read this book first in 2011 and it is still a good overview/reference on this topic. However I was clearly wrong about not having this problem ever.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Natives-Class-Empire-Sunday-Bestseller/dp/1473661234/">Natives</a> by Akala</strong>. An eye-opening part autobiography, part polemic on racism experienced as a not-white person growing up and living in contemporary UK. A difficult but necessary read even for those of us who are neither British nor living in UK. I don't share authors view on everything (Castro, China...), but would nevertheless recommend this book to anyone who cares about (racial) justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure I never read fewer books in a year since I learned how to read. 2021 is not shaping up to be a great year either, so my plans will remain modest. Hopefully at least high single digits and evenly split between work and pleasure.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>The last catalog post in the series of what occupied me last year, but this one has a lineage. I’ve been writing about the books I read annualy since 2009. I was young back then.</p>
<p>Links still lead to Smile Amazon. Those without them are not terrible (like previous years), just without an entry there and I was too lazy and tired from hiking to find a different link. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them. I recommend those in bold. Those wanting to improve their focus may want to check <em>Deep Work</em>.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/">Securing Angular Applications</a> by Ryan Chenkie. While it covers all important bits it is too full of unrelated fluff and could be edited to a quarter of its length. Best for those new to Angular and web development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Evolution-Intelligent/dp/0008226296/">Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith.</strong> I love this book, but not everyone does. A fascinating look at development of intelligence and cephalopods for those interested in both and I was not bothered too much that author occasionally wanders a bit.</li>
<li>Security and Frontend Performance: Breaking the Conundrum by Sonia Burney &amp; Sabrina Burney. A short focused book on improving website's security and performance mainly through better use of HTTP, improving delivery of 3rd party content and use of service workers. A bit aged after 2 years, but still provides a good overview for those using 3rd party resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Chess-Story-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171691/">Chess</a> by Stefan Zweig. A novella about chess, human need for stimulus and psychological torture.</li>
<li>Schachnovelle by Stefan Zweig. Same as previous one, except without minor translation errors. Figured out I could read it in original German and liked it enough to do so.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Arab-Future-Childhood-1985-1987-Graphic/dp/1473638283/">The Arab of the Future 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987</a> by Riad Sattouf. Third part of trilogy that will have at least 4 parts. Highly recommended for those who liked first two.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/My-Sister-Serial-Killer-Novel/dp/0385544235">My Sister, the Serial Killer</a> by Oyinkan Braithwaite. A crime novel by a Nigerian author about two sisters, one of which with a penchant for dead now ex-boyfriends. Not my usual fare, but I enjoyed this quick-to-read book a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng/dp/0735224293">Little Fires Everywhere</a> by Celeste Ng. Recommended by Tomaž. I was not bothered by it being somewhat predictable, as I don't think author generally tried to or needed to surprise reader, but I think the book would be better if author didn't use future to somewhat sentimentally resolve some narrative threads. Otherwise well written engrossing story with rare off note and I really enjoy reading it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Train-Time-Essential-Heinrich-Boll/dp/1935554328/">The Train Was on Time</a> by Heinrich Böll.</strong> A German soldier boarding a train to the front in Poland has a premonition of his impending death (train ride not incidentally following route of millions of European Jews). A meditative mostly first-person account on war, life, loss and historical disgrace. The kind of book that changes you.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a> by Cal Newport. I'm ambivalent about this book since I am definitely in its target market, think it has some solid advice and writing itself isn't bad. However, I also mind that much of it is poorly sourced or supported, some clearly coloured by author's prejudices (matching mine) and all of it too closely shaped as self-help genre these days demands.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Springtime-Broken-Mirror-Mario-Benedetti/dp/1620974908/">Springtime in a Broken Mirror</a> by Mario Benedetti.</strong> A book about a political prisoner in Uruguay and his family in exile written by Benedetti when he was, too, in exile. Wise, witty, moving, profound book is certainly one of the best I read in the last decade and deserves to be read slowly and more than once.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Beautiful-Summer-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241983398/">The Beautiful Summer</a> by Cesare Pavese. A short novel about a girl’s loss of innocence in 1930’s Turin. Another take on a familiar story which is neither good enough to recommend nor mediocre enough to complain. Translations occasionally felt dated and to me difficult to understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Functional-Steps-Transforming-Programmer-dp-1449368174/dp/1449368174/">Becoming Functional</a> by Joshua Backfield. “...in Java move to Scala.” OK, but with annoying boss examples and cumbersome language pick.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Failure-Memoir-Gary-Shteyngart/dp/0812982495/">The Little Failure</a> by Gary Steyngart. Generally not a fan of autobiographies, but I read this one because I like his writing and do not regret it. It is not only a seemingly very honest assessment of his life, family and relationships so far, but it also provides an interesting view in being Russian Jewish immigrant in USA.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Functional-Thinking-Paradigm-Over-Syntax-dp-1449365515/dp/1449365515/">Functional Thinking</a> by Neal Ford. Similar to Becoming Functional with more emphasis on how to think “functionally” then what functional programming is. Also very focused on Java developers and diluted by involving too many alternatives and not enough focus. Still, better than Becoming Functional.</li>
<li>Functional Programming in Python by David Mertz. A short introduction to functional programming with Python3. Liked it better than the other 2 as it felt more on point. Again wished it touched also on architecture parts of development.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Node-Front-End-Developers-Server-Side-Applications-ebook/dp/B0073U0XFM/">Node for Front-End Developers</a> by Garann Means. Read to kill time on a flight since it is already very old (2012). Basic enough for examples to mostly still work, but not sure who the audience is. Useful information could be condensed to quarter of its already meagre size.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Burial-Rites-Hannah-Kent/dp/0316243922/">Burial Rites</a> by Hannah Kent. A dramatised story about last woman to be executed in Iceland, picked while we were there. I got progressively more interested and by the end could hardly put down this well written story.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Levels-Julian-Barnes-3-Apr-2014-Paperback/dp/B011T7HJZQ/">Levels of Life</a> by Julian Barnes.</strong> A book about finding and losing love, especially tragically by the author. Or as Independent put it better: "Anyone who has loved and lost can't fail to be moved by this devastating book."</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008211213">Running Blind</a> by Desmond Bagley. I rarely read crime novels, but I enjoyed this one visiting so many Icelandic tourist spots. Written well enough and certainly surprising enough to keep my attention until its end.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cat-Man-Two-Women-ebook/dp/B075V3VP46/">A Cat, a Man, and Two Women</a> by Junichiro Tanizaki. A novella about a love triangle with a true feline rival. Enjoyable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Little-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241357454/">The Lady and the Little Fox Fur</a> by Violette Leduc.</strong> Almost poetic and most truthful description of poverty and loneliness which demands to be read slowly as every sentence is rich with meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect 2020 to be busy so I’ll be happy if I manage to read as much as passed year. I hope to keep my fiction and non-fiction selection varied and keep trying to avoid Anglo-Saxon authors.</p>
<p>This year I enjoyed almost everything I read purely for my own pleasure and <a href="../on-technical-writing.html">almost nothing</a> I read for work. My work-related reading will likely be directed by work circumstances and hopefully less frustrating.</p>
