            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>...were very few. This year has been a reading disaster. I have never read so few books since I learned to read. My list would be even shorter if it did not contain three items ambitiously described as books by publishers. If I change nothing this year, I will definitely change this.</p>
<p>Which is not to say I did not read much. It was a US presidential election year and I read too many things that on the whole did not do me much good except further erode an already low opinion of mainstream journalism. I may (or not) come back to this in my annual review of past year. Also watched too much (good) TV.</p>
<p>Interestingly all my reading was done either on tablet (first 4 items) or Kindle (last two), both of which worked well and neither being perfect. However I expect this to be more common as convenience can't be ignored.</p>
<p>I haven't read much, but I can still recommend one book: The Oracle of Oil. Generally, I don't see a point in reading biographies and reading a book from the author you personally know also carries a risk of what to do if you don't like their work. Luckily for me Mason's book is excellent. A meticulously researched and engaging story of a father of peak oil kept me interested all the way through and left me pondering the power of wishful groupthink and (in)effectiveness of data substantiated arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured/dp/1491901942/">AngularJS Up &amp; Running</a> by  Shyam Seshadri and Brad Green . A good introduction to 1.x version of AngularJS framework that gives you a solid overview of what can be done and how you should go about it without getting lost in advanced specifics.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI57PWo6HRAhVNeVAKHSQCA0kQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fweb-development%2Freactjs-essentials&amp;usg=AFQjCNFce0pG40bQZb-AQTvziAd2Uxkowg">React.js Essentials</a> by Artemij Fedosejev. A gentle introduction to React.js and Flux avoiding rest of React's ecosystem as it does building complex, multi-screen applications. Still good first book to read on the subject.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/the-secrets-behind-great-one-on-one-meetings">The Secrets Behind Great One-On-One Meetings</a> by Esther Schindler. From a series of recent O'Reilly short books (booklets?). Excellent guide on how to conduct effective one-on-one meetings (or receving one). Recommended for everyone with a job.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/designing-culture.pdf">Designing Culture</a> by Kristi Woolsey. Another booklet, but not as good as the previous one. Too few practical examples and because of author's background it focuses mainly on using architecture/design to influence culture. Still useful if you are in a position to influence or change working environment.</li>
<li>La Mujer Alta by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón. Not so much a book as a short story, but it was the first longer text I read mostly in Spanish (with <em>a lot</em> of help from interleaved English text). It is a story I suspect just did not age well since 19th century when it was written. Skip unless you are learning Spanish.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Oil-Maverick-Geologists-Sustainable/dp/0393239683/">The Oracle of Oil: A Maverick Geologist's Quest for a Sustainable Future</a> by Mason Inman.</strong> An engaging biography of M.K.Hubbert, the father of "peak oil". It is more than just a story of a brilliant man pushing an unpopular view and provides an opportunity to draw lessons still relevant today.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year I will achieve my plan of reading more books than last year as I could hardly read fewer. Some fiction would be nice and another Spanish book would be welcome too. My goal is again 15 books, but if I don't read at least 10, then, well... I have a year to think of a suitable punishment.</p>

                <p>2015 was a year of completely <a href="../2015-review.html">missed plans</a> and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.</p>
<p>We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.</p>
<p>I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. </p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: <em>Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).</li>
<li><a href="http://diytoolkit.org/">DIY Toolkit</a> by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/">Missing Person</a> by Patrick Modiano.</strong> The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/">Wyrd Sisters</a> by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/">Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</a> by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.</strong> Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/">The Shepherd's Crown</a> by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/">The Arab of the Future</a> by Riad Sattouf.</strong> A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058">Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration</a> by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).</li>
</ul>
<p>This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.</p>

  As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don’t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).
 </p>
 <p>
  All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.

   A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can’t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.

     The Quiet American
    </a>
    by Graham Greene.
   </strong>
   I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn’t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish

   GEB
  </a>
  even if I discover that I don’t like it.
