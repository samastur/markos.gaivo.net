  <strong>
   Warning:
  </strong>
  this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started using
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Description of IRC">
   IRC
  </a>
  almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">
   Tumblr
  </a>
  and a
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" title="Definition of neologism">
   neologism
  </a>
  that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I never heard of something like that related to
  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">
   WordPress
  </a>
  although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.
 </p>
 <p>
  However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29" title="Ulysses - an example of such work">
   Joyce-like stream of consciousness
  </a>
  . I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.

  I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E65" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia E65">
   Nokia E65
  </a>
  user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900">
   Nokia N900
  </a>
  is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.

  , which I can heartily recommend to anyone interested in what games are all about. But it’s this part on page 88 that really got my attention, since I can relate it to what I do:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison, though:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.
   </li>
   <li>
    Games are good at
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification" rel="wikipedia" title="Objectification">
     objectification
    </a>
    . Stories are good at empathy.
   </li>
   <li>
    Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Games are external — they are about people’s actions. Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal — they are about people’s emotions and thoughts.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A lot has been said in last couple of years about
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic" rel="wikipedia" title="Game mechanic">
   game mechanics
  </a>
  and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or customization?
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually means it wants to provoke action on visitor’s part. Intended action may be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or subscribe to blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction with a visitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull, but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage" title="Amazon">
   Amazon.com
  </a>
  presents other side of spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren’t there to read an item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items, reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn’t be used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you make a more informed decision on what and when to include.
