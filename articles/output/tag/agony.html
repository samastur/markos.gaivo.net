    I like -beta- idea and I think adding -alpha- might be even better. There’s still a problem of resolving syntax conflicts between different implementation which I think has a simple solution that closely mimics what browsers already do:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     When parsing CSS browsers
    </em>
    <em>
     should apply the last matching -beta-/-alpha- directive they fully understand.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Browsers already ignore directives they don’t understand and they apply last directive found when there are multiple candidates for a DOM node.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such behavior would give us less CSS code to write and maintain, have predictable behavior and keep browser experimentation without favoring one. I have troubles finding negative sides of this approach, but do let me know if you can think of one.
