    A class of bugs I really dislike debugging are those that depend on specific data and affect only a very small subset or just one user. Things could sometimes be fixed so much faster if you could just log in as him to see what is happening. Sometimes this is exactly what we do
    <strong>
     with his explicit permission
    </strong>
    , but I really dislike asking for passwords.
   </p>
   <p>
    First it inconveniences user. He has to come up with either a new good password or go through two password changes. Second it implicitly teaches wrong behavior. Passwords simply should never be revealed.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is why I wrote
    <a href="https://github.com/samastur/Impostor" title="Impostor's home at GitHub">
     Impostor
    </a>
    , a Django app that allows staff members (and only them) to login with their own credentials as a different user. Idea is not mine (kudos goes to
    <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201008/django_superuser_login_trapdoor.html" title="Ned's post where idea comes from">
     Ned Batchelder
    </a>
    ), but I like it. To discourage abuse every such authentication is recorded and can be seen in Django admin interface, but can not be altered from there.
   </p>
   <p>
    So how does it work in practice?
   </p>
   <p>
    Lets say that I would need to log in as user
    <em>
     fry
    </em>
    . To do this I would enter as my username
    <em>
     markos as fry,
    </em>
    provide my password and voila, I’m him. This has been recorded so anyone with access to ImpostorLog part in admin can see all such cases, mine included.
   </p>
   <p>
    Impostor may also ease your development by removing need to remember different passwords for testing. This is usually not a problem unless you happen to develop with fake data but real accounts. Like me.
   </p>
   <p>
    And again for morally challenged out there:
    <strong>
     you should never login as somebody else without his explicit permission
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Update
    </strong>
    : Thanks Ross for reminding me where idea came from. I updated text accordingly.

    April is about to end and with it also the deadline to
    <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/">
     submit your EuroPython talk
    </a>
    . I thought about submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my current workload.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not) Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality. It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had to miss last year, feels like home.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s why I decided to volunteer this year. It’s a way to give a little bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.
   </p>
   <p>
    So do submit your talk and come. It won’t be the same without you.
