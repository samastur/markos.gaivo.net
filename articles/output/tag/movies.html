            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>We saw 101 films last year, which still feels mind-boggling to me. We started even more, but gave up on 3 of them. Life is too short to persevere through movies or books you don’t like.</p>
<p>This year I expect to watch fewer films. Not because 100 is impossible to repeat, but I hope visual media will take a smaller slice of our lives. Then again, I’ve just subscribed to <a href="lhttps://mubi.com">Mubi</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I regret seeing them. There were few duds and so many I liked. Clicking on movie titles will reveal my brief impressions of them and I already opened my favourite ones. Selection could easily be different, certainly larger and probably would be if I did it some other day.</p>
<p>List of 100 movies makes this almost certainly the longest post I’ve written on this website even with (very) brief impressions. Enough words then and here’s the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Lady Macbeth (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291600/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I wouldn't start 2021 if I was aware of its source material and wasn't under the wrong impression that it is a kind of Shakespeare adaptation. What at first looks like a story of female empowerment becomes progressively crueler and redeem-less. Florence Pugh is superb though in her breakout role.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>In den Gängen (In the Aisles) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006263618/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A bittersweet look at lives of blue-collar workers in German supermarket. A subtle, moving film.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Zimna wojna (Cold War) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6543652/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A beautiful masterpiece from Pawlikowski. It's as close to perfection as films get and deserves multiple viewings.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Black Bear (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601220/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A split opinion in our household, but I liked it and its surprises even though I also think distressing scenes in last third of a movie could be shorter.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>i'm thinking of ending things (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7939766/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A challenging to decipher, but thought provoking movie beautifully shot by Lukasz Zal with an excellent cast with Jessie Buckley amazing performance.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Diplomatie (Diplomacy) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3129564/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>One of the marks of a good movie is that you are on edge even though you know what the end will be. Based on a play so it's a great choice for those of us who enjoy "talking" movies.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Undir trénu (Under the Tree) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6223806/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Another movie described as comedy or comic by ill-adjusted critics. It's really a dark drama of neighbour quarrelling with escalating effects on both family. Well made even if the events are fairly predictable.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em><del>Return to Montauk</del> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5247776/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Failed to meet even our low expectations and gave up on it somewhere in the middle.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>羅生門 (Rashomon) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I wouldn't mind if some of the fights were shorter, but it is otherwise as good as it ever was and highly recommended repeated viewing.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Ahlat Agaci (The Wild Pear Tree) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6628102/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A Nuri Bilge Ceylan movie. It is probably the most talky drama of his with wonderful performances. Can't recommend enough.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Mot naturen (Out of Nature) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3596492/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>An internal monologue of a man on a hike experiencing mid-life crisis.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>In & Of Itself (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11916302/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A recording of a show made by Derek DelGaudio that is both surprising and thought-provoking examination of identity.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>The Right Stuff (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Worse than I remembered. Full of male bravado that gets in a way of an interesting story largely unexplored.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Uzak (Distant) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346094/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Another movie by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a study of loneliness and frustration from inability to humanly connect. Sad, moving, profound and deserving of every accolade it received.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Bab el hadid (Cairo Station) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051390/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A real surprise. The story itself is a bit thin and predictable, but the pay-off is really in characters which includes the station itself and their inherent humanity. Astonishing that it could be made then and not surprising that public in Egypt found it scandalous.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Dolor y gloria (Pain & Glory) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8291806/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I just love this semi-autobiographical film by Almodóvar about an ageing director facing ill-health and decline of his powers. Tender, witty and beautiful to look at.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>White Material (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135952/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I can see why Haneke is a fan of Claire Denis. A story about a white coffee farmer and her family in an unnamed African country torn by violent conflict at both delivers what one would expect and still surprise and shock you consistently. A complex, beautifully made movie that is rewarding more than enjoyable.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>A Serious Man (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1019452/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I forgot I've seen this movie until Déjà vu feeling got too strong. I'm sure I liked it then just as much as I did now which is a lot.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>La stanza del figlio (The Son's Room) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208990/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>My favourite movie by Nanni Moretti that will especially resonate with those of us who have suddenly lost somebody close. A beautifully developed story of a happy family going through a sudden trauma and finding healing from unexpected source.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Capitaine Conan (Captain Conan) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115822/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A great movie examining what happens to soldiers once armistice is signed and their honed skills become a liability. Even more so when caught in a limbo of less known part of history when the won WWI was not quite over for many of them yet. Gripping, sad and thought provoking.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>L'avventura (The Adventure) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053619/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A movie I more appreciate than enjoy. Cinematography is spectacular, but the movie held me less after the story leaves the island.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Conte d'automne (Autumn Tale) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137439/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Perfectly watchable, but highly overrated. Maybe looks better if you've seen his other seasons movies (I haven't), but although the movie has its delightful moments, the performances and the script just don't click enough for me.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>My Dinner with Andre (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Odd and engrossing movie that practically requires repeated viewing as two hours of non-stop dialog will keep you preoccupied to really think about many ideas thrown out. Greatly draws from main characters real life and it is difficult if not impossible to tell where real life ends and scripted thoughts begin.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A touching, wonderful film inspired by Truffaut's difficult youth and love of cinema.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Hors Satan (Outside Satan) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666168/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>An odd movie with religious motives. Rewarding and thought provoking for few who won't hate it (I didn't).</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Unrelated (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt01107850/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A Joanna Hogg movie, a subtly crafted look into civilised unhappiness of well-to-do people. Reminds me of her next movie Archipelago.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3797512/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Occasionally funny surreal comedy that mostly doesn't work for me. It would benefit from being significantly shorter. A disappointment.</div>
    </details>

    <details open>
        <summary><em>Palm Springs (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Less surreal than the previous movie and one of the funniest, surprising and surprisingly introspective comedy I've seen this millennium. Just great.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Hail the Conquering Hero (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036891/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Still holds really well and the famous restaurant scene is brilliant (and not just that scene). </div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Le monde est à toi (The world is yours) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6892462/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Forgettable.</div>
    </details>

        <summary><em>8½ (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A movie that demands a second viewing to fully appreciate, but is pretty great even after first. Every frame really is a painting. I would enjoy it more without the sexism though.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Yi Yi (A One and a Two) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244316/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I love this bittersweet drama about one family life's choices and regrets.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Die Verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073858/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Kafkaesque conflict between Katharina, caught in events, and system that does not care for her. The movie touches on many issues, but is mainly a condemnation of the West Germany press of the time with questions about absolute freedom of press. Worth seeing.</div>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Well, I <a href="../books-i-read-in-2020.html">didn’t read many books</a> last year and we didn’t see any exhibitions and only one show (Fleabag and even that online). It wouldn’t surprise me if we watched even more TV than last year, but it turns out we didn’t. We saw more movies though. I’m slowly getting comfortable with not seeing the whole film in one seating.</p>
<p>Shows and movies I liked most are marked in bold.</p>
<h2>TV</h2>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7875794/">Wisting</a> (Season 1, aborted).</em> First 4 parts were interesting enough. I thought it was interesting to observe a team trying to catch a serial killer where none of the officers is competent and professional. 5th part was unwatchably absurd and I gave up on the series.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9100822/">The Valhalla Murders</a> (Season 1).</em> Better take than Wisting on what tenacious mediocre police can resolve. Perfectly watchable.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/">The Leftovers</a> (Season 1-3).</em></strong> Hard to say much about it without spoilers, but it is thought-provoking, moving and absolutely must-see.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8089592/">Little Fires Everywhere</a>.</em> Series made after the well-known book that takes a lot of liberties with it, uniformly for the worse. Read the book, it won’t take longer.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228230/">Quiz</a>.</em> A fun and overall well made 3-part series about the 2001 cheating scandal on the quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10234362/">Avenue 5</a> (Season 1).</em> As usual Iannucci's takes a bunch of obnoxious people, throws them in a high pressure screwup and see what happens. As a fan of his work I'm biased to liking it and I did, but wonder if some of the references and occasionally jokes tempo weren't too demanding for most. Looking forward to the next season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8064302/">Dead to Me</a> (Season 2).</em> The second season of comedy drama of dealing with consequences of unintentionally inflicted loss. Skip if you didn't like the first season, which I obviously did.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4370596/">Better Things</a> (Season 4).</em></strong> Fourth season of family life of a working actor in LA is even better than previous one. Absolutely loved it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/">The Good Fight</a> (Season 4).</em> Because of Coronavirus shortened season that suffers greatly for it with unexpected and unsatisfying "end". Best to avoid until missing 3 episodes are produced.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9244556/">Mrs. America</a>.</em> Revelatory and entertaining, but expected better and would be without invented Alice Macray and toned down conflicts within movement.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10332256/">Hannah Gadsby: Douglas</a>.</em></strong> Nanette was a tough act to follow, but Douglas is great. Original, funny and provoking in the best sense. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7631146/">The Split</a> (Season 2).</em> I'm a fan of Abi Morgan's work and liked the first season well enough, but am really disappointed with the second one. Absurd with almost no character making sense and seemingly overarching idea that having a child is a wonderful idea no matter how self-destructive a person is.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4378376/">Babylon Berlin</a> (Season 3).</em> As good as always with rarely visible historical slips, but with a weak last episode. Wish it ended after 11th. Even bleaker season than previous, ending with a crash of '29. Wonder if season 4 might not become too hopeless to enjoy.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276618/">Strike</a> (Season 3).</em> Third season is an adaptation of the fourth book in Cormoran Strike series by Robert Galbraith (JK). Old-fashioned crime fiction well written and even better casted. At this point I can't imagine anyone else in leading roles. Fun.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9348692/">Criminal: United Kingdom</a> (Season 2).</em></strong> Second season, this time with 4 well written episodes (3rd being the weakest). Enjoyed it greatly and I hope there's another season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2077823/">Perry Mason</a> (Season 1).</em> A well produced new series showing how Perry Mason became famous defence attorney. Full of surprises especially for those familiar with Perry's character and thoroughly enjoyable. Hopefully this was only the first season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10485750/">The Pale Horse</a>.</em> Sarah Phelps' Agatha Christie adaptation that was both better than I expected and worse than I hoped. Was fine with most of it, but not keen on its finale.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/">Silicon Valley</a> (Season 5-6).</em> WTH? Was writers room fired? An excellent satire with surprisingly good grasp of technology and silicon valley forgot all that and became a tiresome drama with ever more awful characters in absurdly unrealistic situations. Occasional joke is drowned in long litanies of techno buzzword drivel.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8005338/">Chris Rock: Tamborine</a>.</em> Expected much more from all the recommendations I've seen. Some poignant and attentive parts almost make up for too many cringey bits.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4604612/">The Alienist</a> (Season 1-2).</em> It took me a while to figure out what bothers me about this mostly watchable crime series happening in New York at the end of the 19th century. It feels unpolished in ways early theatre rehearsals can, clunky sentences, good actors not quite clicking, scene setups often too obvious, but Rosy McEwen in the second season is absolutely fantastic. I won't watch the next season, if there is one.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9359220/">Young Wallander</a> (Season 1).</em> Watched because of my affinity with the main character from previous outings. Found the end especially unsatisfying. There will be another season, but I won't be watching that either.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/">The Crown</a> (Season 4).</em> The fourth season of the series is very much like the previous ones, just with characters generally becoming less likeable.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/">John Adams</a>.</em> I'd like it much more if I skipped the just miserable 7th part and could share creator's fascination with crooked horizons. I am not as impressed with it as many, but it's interesting well made drama about part of history I don't know well.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8134470/">The Undoing</a>.</em> I liked the first 5 episodes even with annoying tilt-shift and blur-everything photography, but the last episode really was disappointing with ending both predictable and unconvincing. <strong>SPOILER</strong>: The setup touches on many interesting potential topics, but the show isn't really interested in any of them beyond providing some uncertainty.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10846250/">Roadkill</a> (Season 1).</em> I liked David Hare's earlier works, but was disappointed by his more recent work. Roadkill is the latest series written by him and I enjoyed it greatly. There are a few problematic scenes sacrificing persuasiveness for dramatic purposes, but overall it is well written and performed political drama about a rise of a very faulty popular politician with an ending leaving the door open for another season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12588432/">Jack Whitehall: I'm only joking</a>.</em> Whitehall can be really funny and has excellent comedic reflexes, but this special was in large parts lazy and stale. Practically the only amusing parts where when target of jokes was Jack himself or his family.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> (Season 6-7).</em></strong> Just as funny and warm as always. Remains one of my favourite shows.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12117854/">Jerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to Kill</a>.</em> Seinfeld doing his shtick. Not good, probably not even for fans.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5457520/">Patton Oswalt: Annihilation</a></em>, 
  <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7026230/">Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping</a></em>, 
  <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12146952/">Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything</a>.</em> 3 specials by Oswalt of which I liked Annihilation the most. Seeing out of order the ones predating the family tragedy and the one right after made it somewhat odd and interesting. Was surprised to see a joke repeated, but while they are not particularly thought provoking, they were entertaining enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7653254/">Marriage Story</a>.</em></strong> Baumbach's compassionate look at marriage breaking up, certainly inspired by his own experience. I was reminded of Irréversible, which although a very different film also has one of the most authentic presentations of love inside of a tragic story.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998/">Game Night</a>.</em> Game Night is exactly what one can hope it would be. A light comedy that is actually funny, but will not be your favourite movie that you re-watch annually. Still better than most modern movie-length comedy.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8404614/">The Two Popes</a>.</em> Latest movie by Fernando Meirelles. Not one of his best, but perfectly fine with very good performances of Hopkins and especially Price.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/">The Irishman</a>.</em> I am not sure why this movie was made. It was fine and is well made if long, but felt flat and mostly like I've seen better versions before. However, while acting is generally fine, Joe Pesci is just brilliant.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110963/">La reine Margot (Queen Margot)</a>.</em> I missed it 25 years ago when it was very warmly received. Like previous one it is another film that I liked, but not as much as most. Depiction of the massacre of Huguenots is as shockingly (and realistic) today as it had to be when the film was first released.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/">Gisaengchung (Parasite)</a>.</em></strong> Just brilliant drama in pretty much every way. A gripping socially conscious story that never feels didactic, shot beautifully, that leaves  you ruminating.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5649144/">The Florida Project</a>.</em> A series of anecdotes that do not provide more insight or generate more mood than a much shorter movie could. Otherwise fine, but I expected more.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/">1917</a>.</em> Good, but not as good as I expected, mostly because of its script. Too predictable, almost offensive characterisations and possibly because of that resulting in a film not as engaging as it could be even though it is amazingly shot.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6053948/">La enfermedad del domingo (Sunday's Illness)</a>.</em> Sad, but beautifully made moving story about a broken relationship between mother and daughter.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6155172/">Roma</a>.</em></strong> A sublime movie worthy of every accolade it received. Rich in details and textures that almost demands multiple viewings. Perfect.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7374948/">Always Be My Maybe</a>.</em> By chance watched on Valentine's and it's a perfect movie for the occasion. Has some clunky parts, but often funny and enjoyable overall.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/">The Shape of Water</a>.</em> Imaginative, provocative depending on your view of inter-species relationships, love story by Guillermo del Toro. I liked it, but it is not a must-see experience.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052311/">Touch of Evil</a>.</em> A movie every cinema buff should see even though it is overrated. Its script and Heston's performance as Mexican cop are just terrible, but Welles is good and cinematically, especially the famous opening scene, is among the best. I saw the version edited according to Orson Welles' wishes.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067328/">The Last Picture Show</a>.</em> Another movie which I found less good as its reputation. Alright depiction of boredom and life in atrophying Texas town focused on characters and not reasons for the town's regression. Some fine performances from supporting cast, but female characters are clearly written as what (many) men imagine women to be like.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5715874/">The Killing of a Sacred Deer</a>.</em> Missed this Lanthimos movie when it came out. Dark and unsettling, leading to an almost inevitable absurdist and brutal ending. Not for those who dislike author's other movies.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/">Uncut Gems</a>.</em> A kinetic and anxiety inducing crime drama about a gambler jeweller trying to strike rich. An exercise in style which covers pedestrian story and overall experience, I suspect, hanging on viewers investment in Howard Ratner which for me was none. Very overrated movie.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5096470/">Love Wedding Repeat</a>.</em> Sam Claflin plays Hugh Grant playing one of his romantic comedy roles. Trailer is better and movie could definitely be better, but I found it funny enough (view not shared by my wife)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10199914/">The Boys in The Band</a>.</em> It feels less impactful than it probably was when the play was first performed and practically everyone in the movie is about 10 years too old (could be easily fixed by script change, but wasn't). Still, I'm a sucker for play-like movies and would enjoy this one more if Jim Parsons was a better actor.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203620/">The Dinner</a>.</em> I liked this movie much better than general public and critics, some of whom clearly did not pay attention. Was everything I expected from the original book's sleeve covers.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436331/">Friends with Money</a>.</em> The kind of movie Hollywood stopped making, a movie with a modest budget looking at lives of average people (in this case well-off LA) where not too much happens and nothing is resolved by the end of it. Not to everyone's liking, but I enjoyed it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090570/">84 Charing Cross Road</a>.</em> A bittersweet true story movie about a decades lasting long distance friendship between book-buying New York based writer and London's bookseller. Like with Friends with Money nothing really dramatic happens, so might be boring to some, but not to me.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107507/">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a>.</em> A Woody Allen comedy "thriller" that I think is under-appreciated even with mostly positive reviews, especially Carlo Di Palma's contribution as its cinematographer. Films are a visual medium and cinematography can be used for so much more than setting the mood and the scenery. The jokes are funny and movie is probably enjoyable for most who are not too repelled by Allen these days, but I especially enjoyed the obvious homage to The Lady from Shanghai.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9606374/">On the Rocks</a>.</em> Vastly overrated pure disappointment from Sofia Coppola. I otherwise like (work of) everyone involved in this movie, but this movie is just bad. Clunky script with awful lines, often delivered unpersuasively and without much to say or show.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10796286/">Dorogie tovarishchi (Dear Comrades)</a>.</em> I've seen it online as part of the Liffe festival. A really well made historical drama about to me previously unknown Novocherkassk massacre. Wouldn't mind seeing it again.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10288566/">Druk (Another Round)</a>.</em> Another movie from Lifffe, this one tackling the question of consequences of excessive alcohol drinking and if they can be positive. Muddled like director's view of the topic. It was fine and I don't regret seeing it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086960/">Beverly Hills Cop</a>.</em> It's more than a quarter of century since I last seen this movie and I was wondering how it would hold up. Still fun and funny and not too dinted by age as so many are from 80's.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6359956/">A Bad Moms Christmas</a>.</em> We watched it because we were too tired to risk something more promising. Has a bunch of actors I like and Susan Sarandon, but was still just awful. Morals of these festive movies tend to be regressive in general, but this one was even more annoying.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10808832/">Let Them All Talk</a>.</em> An unconventional movie with Soderbergh’s outline guiding actors improvisations. Works better than one would expect and I enjoyed the result, but would surely rate it lower if I didn't know how it was made.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10618286/">Mank</a>.</em> Almost a masterpiece that falls short mainly by its sexist portrayal of women that cannot be excused with movie being an obvious homage to films from the era it portrays. Too bad, but otherwise very much worth seeing.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6412452/">The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</a>.</em> 6 short western stories written and directed by Coen brothers, ranging in tone from dark humour to pure bleakness, but always engrossing.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6439020/">The Personal History of David Copperfield</a>.</em> A series would work better. The pace is too fast to really respond to depicted events and Copperfield comes across meaner than he would otherwise. Colour-blind cast is great and movie is fun, but I expected more from reviews.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/">Baby Driver</a>.</em> Edgar Wright frustrates me. His talent and meticulous work in creating truly cinematic pulp movies is often wasted on predictable (genre) clichés. Reminds me of Spielberg who keeps ruining his movies with his sentimentality. Still enjoyable ride for pulp or genre fans.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/">Beoning (Burning)</a>.</em></strong> One of rare films where my understanding and appreciation grew with time after its end. I still think some digressions don't add much to the movie which could be shorter, but it is overall still a great film well worth watching.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p><a href="../culture-2019.html">As said</a>, this year I expanded my note keeping. I’m also recording TV and movies I’ve seen and while I’m not sure if there isn’t a whiff of lunacy to the scope of my tracking, it can be useful, especially for multi-seasonal TV content to decide if one should give next season a go when it comes out. I watched a lot of TV and I mean <strong>a lot</strong>. I could despair about time I spent doing it if much of it wasn’t to relieve boredom of indoor exercise, there were better things to do or if I was snobbish about TV watching as such which I am not. However, it does make this post absurdly long.</p>
<p>I did spend comparatively little time watching movies. Ironically that was because they are longer and it is easier to fit up to an hour long chunks of content into exercise regimen or dying hours of a day. As blasphemous as this is to many directors, maybe I should watch movies in parts next year (except those rare few I still grudgingly see at local cinemas).</p>
<p>Shows and movies I most liked are marked in bold.</p>
<h2>TV</h2>
<p>Of all the things that could be watched this year, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9573980/">Leaving Neverland</a> had and will have by far the most profound and doubtlessly lasting impact on me and I didn’t even see it!</p>
<p>Every year there are shows on which I disagree with most critics. This year I was most bothered by gushing over Succession, which is well done but forgettable and poor reception of The Morning Show, which deserves more respect.</p>
<p>I was especially impressed by the first episode of <em>Fleabag</em>, mini series <em>Chernobyl</em> and all seasons of <em>Rectify</em>. I think they are all masterpieces.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8463714/">The ABC Murders</a>.</em> I was at first skeptical about Malkovich playing Poirot, but he did the excellent script by Sarah Phelps full justice. Her changes to original material were substantial and not for Christie or Poirot purists, but have really elevated the material above a light evening entertainment. It is the only Christie adaptation I remember thinking about days after I saw it and could not recommend it enough.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8002604/">Camping</a> (Season 1).</em> An odd and occasionally funny outing of mostly unlikeable characters that really goes off the rails in the last episode and makes you question why you bothered watching.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7230846/">No Activity</a> (Season 1).</em> A US adaptation of an Australian show about two bored coppers on a stake out where nothing much happens. Uneven, but mostly funny enough for light entertainment.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1474684/">Luther</a> (Season 5).</em> Luther was always also silly, but Neil Cross really stopped caring. The best I can say about season 5 is that it wasn't season 4 or Hard Sun and I could ignore nonsensical stuff most of the time. Still, no matter what happens to Luther in the future, this is the last one I'll see.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8010592/">Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, American Crime Story</a> (Season 2).</em></strong> Did not expect to like or be interested in this one, but it was excellent. Versace's murder is used not only to show what happened to the famous designer, but also to explore and explain what led to it and how difficult it was to be gay.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6859806/">Mrs. Wilson</a>.</em> Ruth Wilson plays portrays her grandmother in an extraordinary story about consequences of a marriage to a bigamist.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5565334/">Friends from College</a> (Season 2).</em> Not well received second season of a show about a group of friends from college (hence title) of questionable character. Obviously not for everyone, but I liked both seasons.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3526078/">Schitt's Creek</a> (Season 1).</em> A sitcom about a family of suddenly impoverished living in a town they own. Funny enough, but I've been told it gets better in later seasons.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/">Russian Doll</a> (Season 1).</em></strong> A young woman keeps dying and reliving her birthday party while trying to figure out what is happening. Could easily be a tropey take on popular reliving a day theme, but is absolutely terrific in so many not always obvious ways. A must see.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270492/">Billions</a> (Season 3, aborted).</em> I liked first two seasons even with some reservations, but had to stop watching 3rd after 4 parts. Problems with script and to a lesser extent acting just became unbearable.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4374208/">Catastrophe</a> (Season 4).</em> A decent ending to fantastic series that might not have reached previous heights (for good reasons), but that I enjoyed throughout.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/">The Good Fight</a> (Seasons 1-3).</em> Spinoff of The Good Wife with some improvements, but with the same unappealing female acceptance of male transgressions in first season. Gets better in second and completely absurd by the end of the third. For fans of the original series.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5014882/">The Durrels</a> (Season 1, aborted).</em> Series made after a popular English book. Could not keep interest after 4th episode of the first season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/">Shetland</a> (Season 5).</em> If you are a fan of competently done crime series, Scotland accent and moody landscape, then this is a show for you. I am.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770590/">Amy Schumer Growing</a>.</em> Comedy special for fans of Amy's humour. Not among best, but I laughed plenty.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6599482/">The Romanoffs</a> (aborted).</em> Watched only the first episode of this anthology series. Waste of time.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183404/">Rectify</a> (Season 1-4).</em></strong> Probably the most realistic take on life and life challenges after surviving death row. Profound, engaging and uninterested in cheap thrills. One of the very best TV series ever made.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3561180/">Ófærð (Trapped)</a> (Season 2).</em> I liked the first series a lot and had great expectations for the second. It was fine at first, but script got more ridiculous as it was coming closer to the end. Still beautiful shots of Iceland's landscape, but not much to recommend otherwise for those not exceptionally gullible.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5069564/">John Mulaney Comback Kid</a>.</em> Funny.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178650/">The Victim</a>.</em> A short drama series about aftermath of a horrible event, when a boy murdered a younger boy. Thoughtful, provocative and well acted. Not an easy viewing, but very worthwhile.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8594510/">Back To Life</a> (Season 1).</em> A dark comedy about rebuilding life after 18 years in prison. Moving, funny and, apart from too long prison sentence, believable. Hope there will be a second season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7820906/">Good Trouble</a> (Season 1, aborted).</em> Awful, bloody awful. A rare miss from usually reliable source of recommendations. Ditched in the middle of the second episode because we couldn't stand the stupidity of it all anymore.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8064302/">Dead to Me</a> (Season 1).</em> Liked it better than most critics. Would watch another season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/">Veep</a> (Season 7).</em> Last season of a very funny show that had to work very hard not to become a documentary.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9169592/">Wanda Sykes: Not Normal</a>.</em> Like most comedy specials best for fans of the performer which I am.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/">Chernobyl</a>.</em></strong> A short series about the accident and its aftermath. The best HBO series in years and I cannot recommend it (and its official podcast) enough.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/">Good Omens</a>.</em> I love the book so I am ill equipped to judge this series, but book's fans should definitely like it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5056196/">Catch-22</a>.</em> Not so much an adaptation as it was inspired by the book. Probably this series can be alright for those who haven't read the book and should NOT be a substitute for reading it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509004/">Enlightened</a> (Season 1).</em> 9th episode is a small gem, but I otherwise could not warm up to this highly regarded series. Maybe it would leave a better, more ground-breaking impression in 2011, but in 2019 its mostly odious characters really don't need this much time and space.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5687612/">Fleabag</a> (Season 2).</em></strong> A great follow-up to the excellent first second with the first episode a spectacular Pinter-like comedy drama deserving to be taught in film school.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8694364/">Years and Years</a> (aborted).</em> Unexpectedly horrible to the point where we gave up after 2 episodes. Paper thin characters, speechifying, trying to touch so many issues it becomes a pale ideological satire of present. I have no idea how this can be Russell T. Davies' work and why critics like it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687642/">Simon Amstell: Set Free</a>.</em> Funny.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/">Mindhunter</a> (Season 2).</em> Drama about development of FBI profiling. Second season is as good as the first one.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/">Succession</a> (Season 1-2).</em> A comic drama series of Murdoch/Sinclair/Redstone like family. Or as someone described it: HBO Billions. Fine in the first season, but much better in its second. Good, but not as great as described.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7909970/">Unbelievable</a>.</em></strong> A short series based on true events of catching a serial rapist. Excellently executed with respect to everyone involved in original events.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8708280/">State of the Union</a> (Season 1).</em> A series of 10 minute episodes about a couple with marriage in crisis. Written by Nick Hornby. Opinions about it are divided in our household, but I liked all episodes except last one.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4370596/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt">Better Things</a> (Season 3).</em> Hard to give a good short description of this series that is even more structureless in this 3rd season, but it remains being one of my favourite.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9348692/">Criminal: United Kingdom</a> (Season 1).</em> A police procedural anthology series with 3 well written and played episodes, especially first two.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10409666/">Gary Gulman: The Great Depresh</a>.</em> Another comedy special with Gary talking about his struggles with depression. Worth seeing.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3920596/">Big Little Lies</a> (Season 2).</em> Not great as the first season, but fine. I do wonder what it would look like if they kept Andrea Arnold's vision.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986056/">Criminal: Germany</a> (Season 1).</em> Second part was bad, but not unwatchable as Criminal: France, the rest of it was very good with two stellar supporting role performances.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3747572/">Grantchester</a> (Season 4).</em> Fourth series of crime drama for fans of sleuthing vicars in post-WWII England. As it ever was, but I've had enough.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4998350/">The Deuce</a> (Season 2-3).</em></strong> A three season drama about systemic exploitation of women and other marginal groups through prostitution, pornography and government/police indifference and corruption. Not an easy watch, but absolutely worth it.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/">The Crown</a> (Season 3).</em> New cast, same family. This time with less affection for people involved, but otherwise much like first two seasons. Meaning still a very good TV.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4322508/">Les témoins (Witnesses)</a> (Season 2, aborted).</em> First series was great and second is like watching a car crash. I couldn't believe the same people were involved in creating a series that is even worse than the abysmal 3rd season of Line of Duty. Why in the world did I not give up sooner?</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11163014/">Mike Birbiglia: The New One</a>.</em> I worship in the church of Birbiglia whose every outing makes me want to become a writer. There is no better storyteller among comedians and his most recent show is no exception.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9644058/">The Guilt</a>.</em> A fun to watch comedy crime series with unexpected ending that tests those who like moral or just endings.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11168100/">Seth Meyers: Lobby Baby</a>.</em> Funny. I especially liked the part channeling his wife.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/">The Morning Show</a> (Season 1).</em> Underrated show about TV morning show examining #MeToo revelations and its consequences on all. Less flashy but with more depth than better received Succession.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<p>There were few real duds this year and a few movies I really liked, but the one that I keep thinking about is <em>Portrait of a lady on fire</em>. It is rare I see a movie which cannot be moved to a different art form without losing some of its magic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075192/">Manbiki kazoku (Shoplifters)</a>.</em></strong> A bittersweet story about a family of misfits trying to survive on margins of Japanese society with help of small crimes and contemplation of what constitutes a family. Not a mood lifter, but one of the best films I've seen in last year.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/">The Favourite</a>.</em></strong> Drama often mislabeled as a comedy because of comic bits about life of Queen Anne. Absolutely must see even if you don't care one iota about Anne.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6742252/">Den skyldige (The Guilty)</a>.</em></strong> A Danish thriller about a police dispatcher receiving a distress call with nothing but his phone, wits and police database to go on with to genre befitting twists and turns. Wholly well done and definitely recommended.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6266538/">Vice</a>.</em> A movie about Dick Cheney's rise to power with an almost distractingly good performance from Christian Bale. Well made and certainly above a typical biography and I enjoyed the movie greatly.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4218572/">Widows</a>.</em> More drama than a thriller about a group of robber widows organising a heist. Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn raise the movie above normal genre fare without sacrificing any of the thrills.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>.</em> Rewatched it after a long time and can still be enjoyable if one can get pass Ferris' obvious psychopathic traits.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714886/">Post Mortem</a>.</em> A movie about a shy Chilean clerk falling in love with his neighbour during 1973 military coup. Good movie, but not an easy watch.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8169446/">Wine Country</a>.</em> An addition to comedy genre of group of friends celebrating birthday on a long weekend trip. Fairly formulaic and mostly for fans of people involved.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5776858/">Phantom Thread</a>.</em> A well produced and acted character study of broken unpleasant people. It kept my interest for 2 hours, but did not left me with any lingering thoughts.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1087890/">Frygtelig lykkelig (Terribly Happy)</a>.</em> I feel like I've seen this noir thriller before. My wife was disappointed, but I thought it was OK.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/">Office Christmas Party</a>.</em> I did not dislike this movie as most seem to even though it can be really ridiculous. Kate McKinnon is a comedic goddess.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/">Booksmart</a>.</em></strong> This movie deserves a better trailer. It's a very funny and refreshing take on a known end of high school formula. Certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in recent years.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7921248/">La Gomera</a>.</em> Another wife's disappointment and I can see how Gilda's part can be really grating, but I enjoyed it while watching even though its main idea is ridiculous on the first examination.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/">Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a lady on fire)</a>.</em></strong> Cinema at its finest. There's not a tone played wrongly in this love story and I hope to see it again soon.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6920356/">The Souvenir</a>.</em> Movies do not get better reviews than this one and I have no idea why. I liked Hogg's Archipelago and Souvenir is certainly technically well done, but the story is pedestrian and has been better done too many times before and I couldn't find anything else to get out of this movie.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8800266/">Ema</a>.</em> I've seen most Larraín's movies and liked all of them except this one. I got confused by focusing on the wrong thing in a crucial scene, but even with that it shows that parts of the movie were done without script as I found characters rambling off-putting. It's still Larraín's movie so not without merit, but I was still overall disappointed.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094606/">The Accidental Tourist</a>.</em> The kind of movie studios don't really make anymore. A story about life after family tragedy, end of marriage and new hope. Worth seeing.</li>
