  Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  A year that started with
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">
   Aaron Swartz’s
  </a>
  death and ended with
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">
   Nelson Mandela’s
  </a>
  never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at
  <a href="http://aptivate.org/">
   Aptivate
  </a>
  and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am *not* an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.
 </p>
 <p>
  I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra">
   Socotra
  </a>
  sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.
 </p>
 <p>
  What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.
 </p>
 <p>
  List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).
 </p>
 <p>
  Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur">
   my Github history
  </a>
  and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.
 </p>
 <p>
  This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of
  <a href="https://twitter.com/trepca">
   Sebastjan
  </a>
  ’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of building tools like
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">
   mjp
  </a>
  or
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet">
   image-diet
  </a>
  I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.
