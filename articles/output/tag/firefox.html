  I’ve been fiddling with my website again, changing theme switching from somewhat dumb class based system to a more proper one using alternate style sheets. I learned that picking a style sheet in browser applies those changes only to currently open page, so for style sheet selection to persevere it needs a bit of Javascript support from website owner. Personally I find this just stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  The easiest way to remember visitor’s preference is to store it in his browser. Cookies used to be popular before they were deemed evil, but they have other limitations as well. Hence popular switch to HTML5 in-browser storage technologies like
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">
   localStorage
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I think there is one important difference between cookies and tools like localStorage that is often overlooked and it’s not the size of data that can be stored. Cookies are sent with
  <em>
   each page request
  </em>
  while data stored elsewhere isn’t. Changing them on any side will automatically share state with the other. I use localStorage in my theme switcher because I think server doesn’t need and should not know which theme is used. But for storing shared data, especially one that expires, cookies remain a reasonable if not best choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of this is exactly new, but I think it is worth remembering. In other news I dislike interface limitations of Chrome more and more (exceptions are Developer Tools and extensions framework).

  I admire the look and feel of
  <a href="http://www.mikematas.com/">
   Mike Matas’ new website
  </a>
  . It is really well thought through. I was also intrigued by how he did it, especially after getting a pop-up on my first visit advising me to use a more modern browser than a recent version of Firefox.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no point in speculating why some of its features don’t work in more browsers. But I was surprised to see that blurred images are served that way and don’t get blurred in browser. I am playing with an idea of implementing a gallery inspired by Mike’s work, but I would like to reduce manual labor needed for maintaining it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I wrote a function that blurs an image on canvas. You can
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/canvas_blur/" title="Javascript blur demo page">
   see it in action
  </a>
  or copy its code, if you find it useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The algorithm used is described in
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060718054020/http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/siggraph/workshops/wjarosz_convolution_2001.pdf" title="Link to PDF version of paper">
   2001 paper
  </a>
  by Wojciech Jarosz. Page contains two implementations, second trading algorithm purity for in my opinion nicer code. Increase number of passes or run it few times over an image, if you need a blurrier result.? Please ask, if you need help with its use.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also measured its speed to see if it fits my needs. That brought a new surprise. Firefox 3.5.8? on my Linux powered VAIO with 1.2GHz processor blurs image twice as fast as same browser on a Mac with a 2.8Ghz processor. Numbers between runs may vary slightly, but never much. No idea why this is happening, since all functions do is some basic math over items in array that should be well optimized everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am sure somebody can optimize it further, but I find it good enough for my use. Image isn’t very blurred after one pass, but one pass over a small image is also a good way to measure how fast a particular computer-browser combination is. On fast combinations I might go for multiple passes over images in view, but fall back to a single pass or no pass on slower systems.

  I often find myself in a room with web developers and at least one of them proclaiming that IE6 sucks because it doesn’t support web standards while others nod in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has bothered me enough to contemplate having a talk at
  <a href="http://www.barcamp.si/">
   BarCamp Ljubljana
  </a>
  . I didn’t, but this is what I would say.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Explorer 6">
   Internet Explorer 6
  </a>
  was released on 27th August 2001, when twin towers were still standing in NY.
 </p>
 <p>
  7 years is a long time to remember, but what did we work with back then? There was no
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" rel="homepage" title="Safari (web browser)">
   Safari
  </a>
  and Firefox was still in its infacy, far from 1.0 release coming 3 years later. It was changing so often most developers simply ignored it. Opera was at version 5 (version 6 came out in November of that year) and I am sure I am not alone in remembering how awful it was at least until version 7 in 2003.
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://mozilla.com" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla">
   Mozilla
  </a>
  was at version 0.6 and although showing great promise, IE6 definitely was the browser we hoped others would match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then no browser supported CSS2 in a meaningful capacity. Opera had the best support for CSS until then, but IE6 surpassed it. It didn’t support DOM Level 2, which was standardized only 4 months before first beta of IE6. Good excuse not available anymore to
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Explorer 7">
   IE7
  </a>
  and IE8. Apart from that it supported more or less everything web developer could want back then and then some. IE6 problem isn’t so much that it didn’t support standards of its time as it is that it doesn’t support standards of today.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why the hostility?
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta" rel="wikipedia" title="Lancia Delta">
   Lancia Delta Integrale
  </a>
  , which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don’t hear them go around complaining how it doesn’t meet standards of todays cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, as I’ve said, 7 years is a long time and most web developers are not old gits like me, so the historic context isn’t there. We also have to live with its real shortcomings today. But I think there’s more to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Complaining about IE6 standards deficiencies is declaring who you are and where you stand. It’s a simple and very recognizable way of declaring you are a member of web-standards tribe. IE6 bitching has at least as much to do with proclaimer as with proclamation’s subject. Trashing IE6 isn’t so much talking about the browser as it is talking about you.
 </p>
 <p>
  However it is not unreasonable to ask why IE6 doesn’t better support standards that were released or updated after its initial release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly more could be done through software updates, but are standards themselves forward looking in a way that would avoid updating browser internals with every new version of a particular standard?
 </p>
 <p>
  I am quite certain that this isn’t always possible. I don’t see how you could add a video object from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5" rel="wikipedia" title="HTML 5">
   HTML5
  </a>
  to a browser without explicit support from browser’s developers. But not all changes are such as
  <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5">
   John Allsopp
  </a>
  has recently pointed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have mixed feelings about HTML5. It’s bringing much needed new capabilities and lots of goodies, but I also think
  <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/15/Grandiosity">
   Sam Ruby
  </a>
  has a point. New, simple,
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration" rel="wikipedia" title="Document Type Declaration">
   DOCTYPE
  </a>
  is reduced to a switch between standards and
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode" rel="wikipedia" title="Quirks mode">
   quirks mode
  </a>
  and unless it will become more complicated in later revisions, it won’t offer an easy way to distinguish between HTML5 documents and other HTML versions. This isn’t a particular problem if newer revisions will be backwards compatible with older, but this isn’t true even of HTML5. Why would we think this is the last version where we will make a major misstep that needs backwards-incompatible correction?
 </p>
 <p>
  There are other things I don’t like about HTML5, but if I would have to pick one thing I would like to see changed, is to make it more extendable.
 </p>
 <p>
  To sum it up, IE6 is indeed a problem in todays development, but it’s also at least at fault for this. It was an excellent browser when it came out and is remarkably solid one for software so old. There are many reasons, completely untouched in this post, why its users don’t migrate to something newer, but we, web developers, are also to blame, because we tend to standardize only current practice and leave few doors open for future development which invariably comes.
