    It’s been more than a month since I got my Nokia 770. In that time, I went through numerous spontaneous reboots, which culminated in one never ending reboot loop after an unsuccessful software install in which I lost my Mahjong best times and a collection of ideas for a project at work. I can’t make it connect to company wireless (although at home it works just fine) and built in email client is a piece of crap that barely satisfies the need to check email. There’s no good way to synchronize data (address book etc.) with other devices and I see no reason why included editor can’t handle any text file.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, I absolutely love this gadget to the point, where my wife jokes about being jealous.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve been thinking about this ever since I flashed the device yesterday. Why is it so alluring to me?
   </p>
   <p>
    Gadgets are not living beings and there’s no charm in their faults. There certainly are many of them, but there’s also a lot to like. Display is fantastic and reading web pages or pdf files finally doesn’t hurt. Those two tasks were the reason I bought it in the first place, so it’s performing its main function quite well. I like the way I can transform it in a little computer with a portable bluetooth keyboard
    <br/>
    that lets me do practically anything. I don’t play games much, but I like those available. I was fine with declared battery time and I’m
    <br/>
    absolutely delighted my 770 like a Duracell bunny easily exceeds it. I’ve got a feeling I can make it do whatever I want, limited mostly by my practically non-existent free time.
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess I like it so much simply because getting more than expected is good enough.
