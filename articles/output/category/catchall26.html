  I was reading Roger Johansson’s blog and came to a
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/">
   post
  </a>
  about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">
   top-posting
  </a>
  and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   &gt; Because it messes up the flow of reading.
   <br/>
   &gt; &gt; Why is replying about quotations annoying?
  </p>
  <p>
   Could you please stop with that? I don’t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it’s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn’t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
   <list>
    archives proves this.
   </list>
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it’s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can’t be a reason to howl down somebody.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don’t think I’m a lesser being for it.

  I thought Harold Evans’
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language">
   last column
  </a>
  was quite good.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no shocking revelation that I’m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I’d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I’ve used for more than three decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I’m sure I still make mistakes like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there’s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you’re talking about and not well enough to actually do.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?

  I’ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I’ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it’s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Customer relationship management.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you’re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I’m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There’s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn’t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it’s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is this so hard for others to learn?
 </p>
 <p>
  By the way, if you need to buy computer hardware and you want to get a good price with as little fuss as possible, please let me know and I’ll send you his email address.
