  I had a problem today. Given two database tables with first having a foreign key pointing to second, find those rows in second table, which are not pointed to from first. Well, it was slightly more complicated than this, but this was the tricky part.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to solve my problem using
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" title="SQL description on Wikipedia">
   SQL
  </a>
  , but I could not. I am not saying it can’t be done, but with my limited knowledge of SQL I could not produce a query that would not perform horribly. Working on production database under heavy use made this a real no-go.
 </p>
 <p>
  After trying to come up with pure solution I finally gave up and decided to solve this problem pragmatically with some scripting. Turns out that too was more complicated than necessary. Unix shell tools are all you actually need, provided your dataset is not too big for your computer limitations (mostly memory).
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of searching for those rows directly, I changed my plan to create two sets of rows, first containing all possible candidates and second containing those from first set which are pointed to from first table. Subtracting second set from first would therefore give me exactly those rows which aren’t pointed to.
 </p>
 <p>
  If file
  <em>
   all
  </em>
  contains a row-per-line list of all candidates and
  <em>
   linked
  </em>
  a similar list of those that are linked to, then you can get non-linked by running following command:
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   cat all linked | sort | uniq -u &gt; non_linked
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  What this does is following.
  <em>
   Sort
  </em>
  will put duplicated rows together and
  <em>
   -u
  </em>
  option of
  <em>
   uniq
  </em>
  will display only unique lines which are those that can be found only in
  <em>
   all
  </em>
  . Problem solved.

  Hearing something often enough can really change my perspective even on things I agreed with completely beforehand. It happened again after reading for umpteenth time that passion for programming/company vision is the quality every new hire should have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Passion is a symptom, not a diagnosis.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  I know a great developer with whom I would love to work again who is passionate about electronics. I am sure he likes programming and does it a lot, but it’s not where his heart truly lies. Which is alright because his other qualities more than make up for any passion deficiencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Passion in complementary direction is doubtless a positive signal, but I simply do not believe that
  <em>
   only
  </em>
  people working on something they care deeply about are able to do it well. We can and do regularly care, with some degree of autonomy, about more than one thing (or person).
 </p>
 <p>
  In more general sense my feeling is obviously a reaction to the end result of a process in which a useful guideline calcifies into dogma. Ideally I could get to this point sooner, but it seems unlikely. If I regularly reconsidered and doubted every piece of my mental framework, then it would mostly be mental and not much of a framework.

  today, who among other things touched on a subject that has been on my mind lately. Software shipping.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Zemanta, we usually don’t ship daily although when needed we do. We try to do a release of new features and bug fixes every 2-3 weeks and on the whole we are succeeding. Still, this is not as often as many startups profess to do and it’s certainly not as often as most of us would like. Even though I probably bear the majority of “blame” for this, I too wish we shipped more often.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why don’t we?
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many factors that define how quickly can something be shipped and even though I don’t think I have an exhaustive list, I find following most important (listed in no particular order):
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   code base
  </li>
  <li>
   shipping changes
  </li>
  <li>
   team
  </li>
  <li>
   tolerance of failure
  </li>
  <li>
   time
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Code base
 </h4>
 <p>
  Simply put,
  <strong>
   better code is easier to change
  </strong>
  and evolve with new features without introducing new bugs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speed of development rarely results in pristine code, so we need to clean things up every now and then, which creates a need to regularly evaluate the quality of our code base and its impact on our ability to deliver.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Shipping changes
 </h4>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Smaller changes are easier to check
  </strong>
  and quicker to develop. More intrusive new code is, harder it is to reliably avoid detrimental effect on already existing code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fixing, testing and shipping a CSS bug can be done almost instantly. Changing core of the widget usually takes a bit more effort to avoid regressions.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Team
 </h4>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Better developers produce better code
  </strong>
  more quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some testing is always necessary, but there’s a direct connection between code author’s reputation and experience and trust we put in his code.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Tolerance of failure
 </h4>
 <p>
  Tolerance of users and tolerance of system to change is crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you provide a service where failure is not an option, then this should affect at least how deeply tested new release has to be. It’s also important for your system to be able to revert to last working state, but sometimes this is not desired and important glitches need to be fixed as they are encountered.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Time
 </h4>
 <p>
  If your
  <strong>
   schedule
  </strong>
  is
  <strong>
   too tight to fix bugs
  </strong>
  found in new release, it’s
  <strong>
   too tight for release
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much you test your software and at Zemanta we do this a lot, new code will introduce new bugs. It will happen that some of them will be too big to wait for next scheduled release and need an immediate fix. If you for some reason can’t afford this, then it may be better not to ship yet.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Pendulum of change
 </h4>
 <p>
  It should be obvious from this list that no factor is set in stone and what might have been a right decision few months ago might not be best one now.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot has changed in last few months, so the next time we address this topic, I suspect my opinion will be different than last time.
