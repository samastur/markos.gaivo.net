    I’ve spent yesterday on Vienna, which was very cold and very snow-less. As it always happens, I get most phone calls when I have the least time for them and they cost me the most.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of them was from telemarketing scum. Do you know what they thought I’ve been really missing?

    This year’s first snow fell couple of days ago and while I enjoy it immensely, I’m getting more and more annoyed by our snowplowers.
    <a class="imageR" href="/images/firstsnow.jpg">
     <img alt="First snow" src="/images/firstsnow_small.jpg"/>
    </a>
    Snowplowing in Slovenia is a state provided service without any business competition and like most such services it sucks. In fact, we relive the same story every year:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     some time in the fall there’s a story published, how everyone is ready for snow this year and there won’t be any problems with our roads
    </li>
    <li>
     we get a correct weather forecast a few days before the first snow
    </li>
    <li>
     snow falls, plowers are nowhere to be seen and there’s a complete mayhem on slovenian roads
    </li>
    <li>
     snowplowers provide some meaningless statistics about resources used and journalists write stories about how they were surprised by the snow
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Now, could you treat your customers and users like this? Probably not.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except if you, like them, are the only provider of vital service. It’s probably still a poor business strategy because even if you are, like telecoms used to be, can you be absolutely sure that this will remain so?
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally, I’d just like to know how is it possible fo them not to be embarrassed infront of their family and friends.

    Ever since I created my first blog, comment spam was an ever present evil. I can imagine it must be really annoying on very popular blogs with lots of comments, but the variety I have is more puzzling than anything else.
   </p>
   <p>
    What’s the purpose of producing spam comments that can’t pass even a simple filter included in default installation of WordPress?
   </p>
   <p>
    I find it highly incredible that someone would be competent enough to write a spamming software and incompetent enough to avoid the only trap WordPress presents. Or is there a benefit to blog spam no one else but me sees?
   </p>
   <p>
    There are other problems with it that make it easy to recognize and handle it. I’m grateful, because I don’t have to annoy anyone with captchas or other comment preventing mechanisms.
