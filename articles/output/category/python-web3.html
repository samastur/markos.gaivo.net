    It seems I praised Beautiful Soup too quickly. I was playing with it yesterday and discovered it mangles Javascript included in file. I can’t say it does this every time, but it’s fairly obvious if you have few kilobytes of code stuck in file. There you have it, another argument why Javascript and CSS should be stored in external files.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s not an option for me though, so I’ll have to work around it.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s still a great module, as long as you can work within its limitations, but it’s not panacea. At least not yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    If I find time, I’ll try to fix the problem, since I really dislike idea of processing files using usual methods (regular expressions &amp; co.).

    So, I’ve been working on this project for some time now, where I’d take user supplied HTML templates and transformed them into new templates, that our system can actually use.
   </p>
   <p>
    I needed to mangle and change them, but I also didn’t want to require from users things like well-formedness and other stuff that makes sense only to web developers (and sadly not even to all of them). Mainly, I want this stuff to be used by everyone, even those with retarded web editors and if it’s good enough to be displayed in their browsers, it ought to be good enough for me.
   </p>
   <p>
    This decision was made a lot easier, when I discovered
    <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/index.html" title="Homepage of Beautiful Soup python module">
     Beautiful Soup
    </a>
    . It’s a python module that makes  screen-scraping much easier, but what is even more cool, is that it makes changing documents, even those with bad markup, extremely easy.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are a python developer, who needs to extract information from or possibly change documents with bad markup, this is the module to use. It will save you time, keep you sane and make you rich. Well, two out of three ain’t bad either.
