  some of the graver errors. But his list is not nearly complete and here are some issues that bother me most:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   not only is Javascript often inlined, it’s also not degradable (crap like href=”javascript:void really has no place in modern web development)
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divitis" title="Description of divitis">

  </li>
  <li>
   inline CSS
  </li>
  <li>
   ridiculously long list of external resources (87 on main page), which result in excruciatingly long page loads on connections with high latency
  </li>
  <li>
   poor contrast between text and background in large parts of a page can be an accessibility problem
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  I could go on, but I don’t want to complain too much. As I’ve said before, this page is a clear improvement over the previous one and it’s also obvious from it that their creators do care about modern development and its often forgotten parts like accessibility.  This is exactly the reason why I decided to write about its failings and not about some other, more atrocious one.

  shows an ambition for good designs and although I don’t think they’re quite there yet, I’m sure they soon will be.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I guess my notion that there’s no need for workshops on XHTML, CSS and web standards in general has been proven wrong.

  Have you ever created a new design for an existing website without changing XHTML templates?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not talking about designs for
  <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">
   css Zen Garden
  </a>
  and its imitators or any other occasion where doing so was done to prove a point. What I mean is building a new design on existing XHTML template during normal course of action.
 </p>
 <p>
  I haven’t and I don’t know anyone who did. It’s also hard to imagine being otherwise if designs are done without taking existing XHTML into account. There’s always an element missing for attaching a part of your design to, unless XHTML was somewhat loose to begin with.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t think this is a problem. There are plenty of real benefits to table-less designs and few, if any deficiencies. However, I do believe that this benefit, touted by many including me, is contrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or am I just wrong? What’s your experience?

  If you’re sitting in the wrong part of the world, then Google might be inaccessible to you right now. That would be only a minor annoyance, if the same wasn’t true also for Google Analytics.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s remarkable how many sites (including this one) use it and are right now more or less inaccessible to every poor soul suffering from Google blackout. That’s because browser can’t tell if external Javascript will use a method like
  <em>
   document.write
  </em>
  and therefore blocks rendering until the code is loaded or it timeouts waiting for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There should be a workaround for times like this and according to HTML4 specification there is
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/scripts.html#adef-defer">
   one
  </a>
  . By using
  <em>
   defer=”defer”
  </em>
  we can signal to the browser that it can safely proceed rendering the page, because we won’t be using any dangerous methods in our Javascript files.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it sadly doesn’t work everywhere. It works in Internet Explorer, but fails in Firefox and Safari. And that simply sucks.
