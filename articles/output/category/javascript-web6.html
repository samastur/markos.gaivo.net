  One of more popular javascript scripts I’ve written is a simple function that hides an email address from spiders by constructing a mailto link on page load. So far it has worked quite well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately I started to have my doubts about this approach though. There was
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mozilla+google+spider&amp;btnG=Google+Search">
   a series of articles
  </a>
  a while ago about Google’s new Mozilla-based spider that I didn’t take too seriously at the time. However, even if not true then, it’s still only a matter of time before a spider like this will show up. The new found popularity of AJAX/Javascript simply guarantees that, since search engines can’t and won’t give up indexing content hidden behind fancy scripts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which means that my script will stop working in not so distant future as will all email obfuscating scripts out there. If it can be seen by a human, then it will be seen by a spider. So is there a way to publish my email address without it becoming public through search engines indexes, which is where most spammers seem to get our emails?
 </p>
 <p>
  I could write a robots.txt file, which would exempt my contact page from being indexed at all. But this is a rather crude approach, since it means nothing on that page will get indexed. I could move email information to a separate page to let other contact data get indexed, but this is hardly any nicer.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I’d really want is to be able to tell to search engines that only a part of my document is off limits. I don’t think there’s currently a way to do this, but if anyone has an idea how to do it, I’d really like to hear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update:
  </strong>
  I think all efforts, including mine, to prevent spammers from collecting published addresses are ultimately doomed. The basic premise of all such approaches is to cloak an address in a way that spider can’t see it or can’t recognize it if it does. By basing spider on something like Mozilla, there won’t be any difference between what spider sees and what user does. There’s a similar problem with recognition. As spiders gets smarter, as they invariably do, you’ll be getting ever growing overlap between smartest spiders and stupidest users until it’s big enough to be unacceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
  So we’ll either put up contact forms or I hope move to defending our inboxes with smart spam filters (those who haven’t yet).

  A while ago I was moaning about a sad state of javascript i18n tools. When I finally started working on it, I faced a dilemma.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should I wait until it’s finished and then reveal it like Moses to chosen people? Look guys what I etched with a toothpick during my lunch time break! You know, I was waiting for my Crème Brûlée and had to kill those few pesky minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or should I choose a more honest approach, showing steps and missteps between embarrassing first version and hopefully usable last?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there’s nothing better than public humiliation to instill some humility so let’s see what is behind the door number two.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal is still the same. Develop a short and relatively fast library that allows you to translate javascript code and HTML content and to do so with as little fuss as possible and with a clear separation between HTML, javascript and translations, but without breaking pages in case translation doesn’t exist yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/translate.js" title="Translation functions">
   here’s
  </a>
  my humble start together with a
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/index.html" title="Link to demonstration page">
   simple demo
  </a>
  . Three functions, two of them a support needed later on. stripStr and stripStrML just strip whitespace at the start and end of string with stripStrML doing it on every line of a given string. We’ll need this later on so we can find strings to translate even if they are enclosed in whitespace to make source display more pretty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there’s a function called _, which takes a string and translates it if javascript object i18nDict exists and has this string as an attribute with a non empty value. Otherwise it just returns the same string, so it doesn’t break page even if translation doesn’t exist in
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/1/i18n.js" title="Translation dictionary">
   translation object
  </a>
  . It’s what is usually called a proof of concept prototype.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s it for today. I’ll try to post updates every couple of days or so, if progress warrants it.
