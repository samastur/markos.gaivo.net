  I like Firefox extensions and use a few myself. Web development without
  <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">
   Web Developer toolbar
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">
   LiveHTTPHeaders
  </a>
  extension would be pretty gruesome. However, there’s a downside to their use that is slowly starting to bother me.
 </p>
 <p>
  They often influence the way Javascript on page gets executed and can produce weird errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I first noticed this while using Web Developer toolbar. Every now and then I got a strange exception, but I didn’t worry too much. After all, it wasn’t really surprising coming from an extension that by its very nature dabbled with the way browser interprets and displays a page and it didn’t really stop the script from working. Not pretty, but you learn to live with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comes this weekend and I get a report that file upload doesn’t work in latest Firefox. I suspected extension conflicts and further examination proved the point. Page worked just fine in the same environment sans extensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  So what can you do, when you stumble on a problem like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Testing your site in various browsers can be troublesome enough. Testing all combinations of extensions even for one browser would simply be impossible. You can’t exactly expect your users to uninstall their extensions just for you, but making workarounds for them doesn’t seem feasible either.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far I don’t see a good solution. Any ideas?

  At least one participant of our recent
  <a href="ajax-workshop-2.html" title="Previous announcement of AJAX workshop">
   workshop
  </a>
  was under impression that I’m an AJAX advocate. It’s certainly a reasonable and not completely wrong conclusion. However, it seems I failed in limited time available to explain my perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  As any other useful tool AJAX has its advantages, but it can also create problems when used inappropriately. I won’t dwell on advantages. More than enough has already been said about them. There are three important aspects that still don’t get enough attention and bear repeating.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Write unobtrusive and degradable Javascript.
  </strong>
  It’s really not that hard with a bit of planning and it makes things easier in the long run. It’s easier to find, fix and change code when it’s cleanly separated from HTML and CSS. I’d expect everyone learned this lesson by now from PHP. Also, creating HTML version first and then carefully improving it with use of Javascript/AJAX can get us maximum reach without sacrificing flexibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pay attention to usability.
  </strong>
  This one is much harder to get right, but if nothing else, you should have in mind at least next three advices. Show a progress indicator when doing something that might take more than a second. Put action trigger as close as possible to the part of a page it will change, so user has a good chance of noticing it and whenever possible assist them with change indicators like
  <a href="http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7" title="Example of yellow fade-in">
   yellow fade-in
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Accessibility shouldn’t be forgotten either.
  </strong>
  This is probably
  <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/64" title="Accessibility problems with DOM manipulation">
   the hardest problem
  </a>
  to tackle. It’s the most important reason (but not the only one) why I try to use Javascript/AJAX only when benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the problems it might cause.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone makes mistakes and I certainly have. I’m sure they weren’t last ones either, but we can all strive for better.

  In true Don Quixote fashion, I made a new attempt to make email harvesting more difficult. It won’t work forever, but it will work longer than
  <a href="hide-email-address-from-spammers-with-javascript.html">
   previous
  </a>
  one, which hasn’t fail yet either.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time I use a bit different approach. Instead of replacing spam-proof, but not directly usable email addresses with mail links on page load, I create mail links on page load, but populate them when mouse moves over them. This way they are still perfectly usable, but less likely to be abused. They are also less friendly, since you can’t see email address until you move your pointer over it. But that was the point, to prevent javascript enabled scrappers.
