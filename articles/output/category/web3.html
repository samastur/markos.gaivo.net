            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <div>
 <p>
  I’ve recently read couple of posts that left an impression on me. First one was Brad Neuberg’s about
  <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">
   personal research agenda
  </a>
  . I haven’t completed list of my problems yet, but I came far enough to know I’m not working on any of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other one was about
  <a href="http://www.entrepreneur2be.com/2007/08/26/idea-blog-socialnetworking-blog20/">
   Blog 2.0
  </a>
  . I’m more interested in content manipulation than social interactions as Pownce and Marela are only two social networking applications I use. Still, ideas contained are intriguing and couple of days before
  <a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/">
   Data Sharing Summit
  </a>
  is the right time to shamelessly pimp my views.
 </p>
 <p>
  Build a social application and you will likely, sooner or later, encounter a dilemma in what your members will be building. Are their creations mainly personal, an expression of their creativity, or are they more of a place where people meet and engage?
 </p>
 <p>
  Most websites don’t fall squarely into one or the other. My blog feels personal not only because I picked the look and topics, but also because my voice is elevated above others. I doubt I would feel the same if comments could look like my posts. I like my place and freedom it offers me.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I don’t care all that much about most networks and degrees of their openness. Really open social network would be interwoven into the fabric of web. I already have my page, I don’t need yet another one. If buddy list is desired, I can use FOAF. Sharing of my stuff? Feeds. Same answer for getting other people’s stuff. Starting a new network would mean creating a widget or a few that can be easily integrated in our sites, maybe some sort of a pinging service if expediency is important and offering a space for personal page for those, who don’t have it yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s amazing how little would need to be changed to implement ideas in Blog 2.0. Basic technology is already here, it’s just not used widely enough yet. Sure there are a few issues that need to be thought through, mainly to do with handling privacy correctly, but they are neither big nor really technological. And price for all this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe a bit less expediency in content propagation and a bit more work for network operators, who might need to learn to live with the same limitations that search engine developers do already. And I’m not even sure that is really necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Update:
  </em>
  Thinking a bit more about this I would be happy enough if social network were just more inclusive. It’s fine that you can create an account and be busy on their platform, but it would be better if you could join and interact with a social network with your own node for as long as that met your needs.

  Andy is among many feeling
  <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/06/whither_w3c/index.php">
   frustrated
  </a>
  with slow progress of CSS3 specifications and role W3C plays or should play in their birth. Having no part in any standardization process with corresponding amount of experience in developing a specification, I’m certainly ill qualified for comment on it with any reasonable amount of certainty.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am, for better or worse, a blogger and I was at WWW2007, so I do have an opinion that like any true blogger find irresistible not to share even if it is in all likelihood wrong. In short, I believe the current state is a result of fairly insignificant intersection between people feeling the pain and those able to do much about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first we wanted to present information and nineties were largely spent developing tools to do so in efficient enough manner. Partial browser stagnation, Mozilla development and CSS2 together with HTML4/XHTML1 more or less brought it far enough that we started having bigger dreams, wanting to do new stuff with our data. Just displaying it on a page doesn’t feel enough anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  These days there is a lot of talk about semantic web, which doesn’t mean same to all people, but is mostly understood as adding meaning to published outputs in ways friendlier to later manipulation and hence more useful. Tools ranging from feeds and microformats to SPARQL might be different, but most are marching in same direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t mean that current set of standards are perfect, but they are good enough that most of W3C doesn’t see them as a still open problem and has moved on to work on other more important things. You can probably listen to Tim Berners-Lee for hours these days without him muttering words HTML or CSS. They are also good enough for general public, which doesn’t care much about how something is done as long as it appears to work, to get what it wants.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are approximately as many Pandas in world as developers with a sense of esthetics, so it is hardly surprising that people bothered enough with current state to complain are mainly designers who care about doing things right. Sadly they are not usually well represented in standards bodies and as mentioned there isn’t an outside pressure that could compensate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only hope I see for new push comes from browser makers who probably don’t want be relegated to a part of an easily replaceable platform for running Flash/Silverlight/Whathaveyou plugins. Hopefully money flowing to them from search engines is good enough to finance a greater effort than one done so far.

  I stumbled upon a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Europe_map_1648.PNG">
   map of Europe
  </a>
  in the middle of 17th century while reading about
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus">
   Jan Hus
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe">
   John Wycliffe
  </a>
  and was surprised to learn how foreign it was to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m a big fan of Google Earth (and Maps), but the thing that I don’t like is that I can only look at most recent information Google has. Normally this is what I want, but not always. I like the fact that
  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ljubljana&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=14&amp;ll=45.762523,14.367714&amp;spn=0.029101,0.083685&amp;t=k&amp;iwloc=addr" title="Map of Cerknica lake">
   photos
  </a>
  of Cerknica lake were taken during one of seasonal droughts, since it makes it easy to find streams and sinks that are gone when lake is full of water. But what will happen if new photos will be taken when lake is full?
 </p>
 <p>
  Information I can access now will be gone and I’ll only be able to wait for a better luck in the future. Google (and other map providers) have provided good tools for moving around three dimensions, but I’d like to be able to move in fourth as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wouldn’t it be nice, if you could see how a place is changing through time or how did states change through centuries?
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem is not so much technical as it is of information gathering. Obviously it’s getting harder (even impossible) to get reliable data  as you go further back in history, but that’s hardly a reason not to try at all. If you’d be interested in working on map of Europe of last couple of millennia, please let me know.
