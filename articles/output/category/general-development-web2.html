  Google Reader was redesigned lately and I’ve been annoyed ever since. I had a dubious privilege of cutting and changing product features people loved in pursuit of
  <del>
   higher
  </del>
  different goals, so I try to be understanding when others do the same. I mostly found clumsy workarounds for removed features, but I do wish I could at least still trust that list of unread items actually has
  <em>
   all of them
  </em>
  . On a positive note I can save some electricity now because copious amounts of “helpfully” white whitespace illuminate this room brightly enough that you wouldn’t sit naked in-front of your computer even with lights turned off. That is if you are the sort of person who likes doing that but stops short of flashing your neighbors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still strongly dislike changes made, but I continue using Google Reader, because crack-heads don’t give up dope just because it was cut too thinly. I cherish my list of reading sources and like a gardener I have been cultivating it through years because I believe they make me better informed than I would be if I relied only on links shared by others. This may be elitist, but it is also true.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are biased when choosing friends and communities we belong to. At the very least we enjoy our life more when surrounded with like minded people which is really a lighter shade of group think. We share to tell stories as much about what is shared as we do about who we are. Even when not self-censoring or trying to project an image we still are horribly bad at evaluating what influences us and how. Sharing everything, as
  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">
   this idiotic article
  </a>
  suggests, doesn’t fix this
  <sup>
   <a href="#reading-sources-note-1" id="reading-sources-1">
    [1]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . It’s still content from same people only more of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there are social new sites, which are in essence news organizations with bigger editorial board. Their focus might not be the same and their world view less obvious (or not) as of traditional boards, but the end result really isn’t all that different. I don’t dread waking up in a world without
  <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple's homepage">
   Apple
  </a>
  as I do in one without  fish, but it is not articles about all things piscatorial that keep popping up on regular basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t make socially filtered news useless, just limited and best suited for finding out what is popular at this moment. They should be a side dish not the whole diet. Getting some of your information diet from social sources may improve it, but relying only on them is just stupid. I wouldn’t fret so much if I didn’t worry about development trends — latest Reader changes being one example of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reader had two methods of sharing. Obvious one was button Share which was adequately replaced with sharing to
  <a href="http://plus.google.com">
   Google+
  </a>
  circles. The other one, which was the one I actually relied on, was to create public feeds for articles marked with certain tags. The most important difference is that in first case you grouped by intended audience and in second by actual content
  <sup>
   <a href="#reading-sources-note-2" id="reading-sources-2">
    [2]
   </a>
  </sup>
  . Instead of following me, you could just follow my selection on particular topic which in most cases would probably be closer to what you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  By itself stripping a feature like that doesn’t mean much. However when I also judge other changes such as aforementioned abundance of whitespace, removal of “Note to reader” and  new reading unfriendly theme, it’s easy to come to conclusion that all roads now lead to Google+. Reader’s role is at best to feed its younger brother with stuff to socialize around.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be wrong to attribute these changes simply to competition with Facebook since they are a part of a larger trend to social curation. I find this trend just a normal consequence of a web ecosystem where most product innovation happens in VC funded startups. How companies were funded was always a part of their DNA and economics of today’s VC environment for companies that will probably be acquired at some point (and let’s be honest, who REALLY believes most news experiments won’t be?) almost demands a quick and high growth. It’s not impossible to achieve this with sources-based product, but it’s certainly harder and less obvious than creating another twist on social news.
 </p>
 <p>
  If my first and main point was a personal appeal to seek insight also in your own, personally picked sources, then my second is to question if shaping web and world with it should really be left only to industry and academia. It really doesn’t have to be this way.

   Browser’s history is a great place to see just how much of what we visit is unimportant, unrepresentative and often unsharable. A small friction necessary for a deliberate act of sharing is actually a feature that gives at least a modicum of reflection on content’s share-worthiness.

   Feeds enable that and are one of crucial building blocks for what I started to call

  I was talking to my wife today about why an “Unknown Source” is becoming the most common source of visits on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://flickr.com" rel="homepage" title="Flickr">
   Flickr
  </a>
  . My guess is that it is almost certainly because a
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer" rel="wikipedia" title="HTTP referrer">
   <em>
    Referer
   </em>
  </a>
  header field is missing in page requests and Flickr is only relying on presence of this piece of data to discern sources. This might have made sense when browsers ruled the web, but we don’t live then anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simply put referrer field
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.36" title="Link to Referer field definition">
   can be added
  </a>
  to request only when request was triggered from source which also has an
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" rel="wikipedia" title="Uniform Resource Identifier">
   URI
  </a>
  address. Every web page has it since its address is also an URI, but most programs don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why referrers aren’t missing only from visitors using paranoid browsers or security software that stripped it out of requests, but also when page is visited from a link embedded in emails or instant messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Requests without referrers used to present a small enough subset of visits that most of us didn’t care. I first noticed this changing when Twitter clients became popular and now there are tons of apps behaving like this. With
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/" title="Link to specification">
   XMLHttpRequest Level 2
  </a>
  ﻿ even web developers will get a choice of making anonymous requests which won’t include potentially private data like referrers.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s nice. I have certainly visited places which I wouldn’t want to share with strangers. But I suspect this is not the common case and most of the time we don’t care telling which page or application sent us there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody can precisely predict future so specifications can never be perfect. But I am always amazed when reading core web specs like HTTP’s how insightful their authors were. That most programs don’t have a URI does not mean that they couldn’t. Practically anything can and definitely more things should.
 </p>
 <p>
  In principle it is possible for each program to have its own address which could be used as referrer
  <em>
   when a better option doesn’t exist
  </em>
  . I suspect this would be against the spirit of specification, but likely not against its text.
 </p>
 <p>
  However better options often do exist. Lets take
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://twitter.com" rel="homepage" title="Twitter">
   Twitter
  </a>
  as a popular example. Every link that triggers a visit from Twitter was included in at least one tweet and every tweet is also published on web. It might not be accessible to everyone, but it does have an address. I see no reason why that address could not be used as referrer by Twitter clients.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is originating content or its address that interest me, but really, almost anything truthful beats an unknown source. Just knowing name of the service (like Twitter) or app used (e.g. Tweetdeck) would be better than nothing. By the way there is another header field that could provide such insight:
  <em>
   User-Agent
  </em>
  . Sadly it is notoriously unreliable and often missing as well, but that’s another long story.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, if I come back to Flickr. I can’t really tell how much Flickr can or could know. I suspect more than it tells, but I would be astonished if they are not mostly in the dark too. Web was largely built by people too busy (and often too lazy) not to cut corners. Meaning: learning and doing as little as possible to get something to work and sometimes we pay price for our ignorance. But it’s a small price compared to waiting for

  After years of personal embarrassment I finally managed to update look and code of my website. This actually happened last week and I wanted to write this post sooner, but
  <a href="http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si" title="Supervizor">
   other things
  </a>
  came in-between. There are still bugs I need to fix (iPad footer is better than it was, but not fine), but﻿ overall I’m pretty happy with how it turned out.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a second site I built using
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/" rel="homepage" title="media queries">
   media queries
  </a>
  and I learned lots. When I learn a bit more about mobile web, I might write a post about few gotchas for new developers, but this is not that post. This post is about
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  tag because it bugged me when I made that first design and I spent a remarkable amount of time on it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  My problem with it came down to its definition.
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  can be used only to mark up contact information about content’s author. In HTML 4 this was limited to authorship of whole page. For HTML5 it
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-address-element" title="Definition of &lt;address&gt; in HTML5 specification">
   was “widened”
  </a>
  to authorship of sectioning element like
  <code>
   &lt;article&gt;
  </code>
  (so if you have more than one article on page, each can contain its own, different, address for its author). You can’t however mark any address with it and after lots of searching I found
  <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-February/014023.html" title="Ian's message from February 2008">
   this old message
  </a>
  from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson" rel="wikipedia" title="Ian Hickson">
   Ian Hickson
  </a>
  which explains why (I’m not aware of any later clarifications).
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t agree with everything said. Mostly correct use is not necessarily a proof of well-designed element. My bet would be that
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  was a rather unknown tag exactly because of its limited use and was thus used mostly by those that dig deeper into standards, which sound also like people who care  how things are used as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still most points are valid. Loosening definition would make it less meaningful.
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" title="Specification of hCard microformat">
   There
  </a>
  <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/adr" title="Specification of adr microformat">
   are
  </a>
  microformats that you can use instead and most annoying problems (allowing only inline content) have been fixed. We also have better tools for parsing HTML so  it really doesn’t matter much if its definition feels completely right or not. It’s good enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end I still decided to mark my contact information on
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net">
   my homepage
  </a>
  with
  <code>
   &lt;address&gt;
  </code>
  anyhow (augmented with
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCard" rel="wikipedia" title="HCard">
   hCard
  </a>
  ), because I am after all the sole author of this website.
