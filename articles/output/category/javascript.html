 <p>
  If this doesn’t look to you like the best peanut butter ever, look again. And again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I go on describing how I make peanut butter, let me spend a moment or two talking about why. After all it can be bought in practically any grocery store in Slovenia and visiting a few will even give you a limited selection. My first reason was to limit my intake. Peanut butter is incredibly delicious, but not exactly healthy and since I noticed that how much I eat is proportional to amount available, I wanted to avoid 350g jars that would be the death of me. My second reason was to have a better control of what goes in it. Like with sausages you can’t really tell what was used and in what condition it was. I certainly didn’t want to eat hydrogenated fat
  <a class="reference" href="#pbutter-1" id="pbutter-1-back" title="Link to first footnote">

   </sup>
  </a>
  added to your stock? peanut butter and were suspicious of a thick layer of oil on top of organic ones too. When I got better at making it, I also found out I really dislike bought ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it happens the only thing that is absolutely necessary to make peanut butter are peanuts themselves. However you will probably want to use some oil, a sweetener like sugar or
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup" rel="wikipedia" title="Maple syrup">
   maple syrup
  </a>
  and salt.
 </p>
 <p>
  I use roasted peanuts. You can buy already roasted (but unsalted) or roast them yourself. To do that you heat up your oven to 175? C and put them in until they are done to your liking. Turn them around every couple of minutes so they don’t get burned. Next step: chopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  But first a side note to all my American friends. Reports that Slovenians don’t eat peanut butter are simply false. We just hide it well. It’s kind of like masonry, but instead of discreet regalia and a secret handshake, we, peanut butter connoisseurs, recognize each other by a subtle nutty odor and small brownish stains in corners of lips. Slightly crazy and distracted look in presence of a peanut butter jar might also be a hint.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, chopping. For small amounts, 200g or less, I use a hand blender with chopper accessory. I also use it because it’s the only blender I own. It tends to overheat and since I melted its predecessor my chopping amounts to mostly waiting pierced with short chopping episodes. Bigger blenders are certainly more resilient, but they also tend to have their blades raised higher from the bottom which makes them unpractical for chopping small amounts of nuts. Spend enough time doing this and dust will turn into a fudge-like paste. Do it more and it will become more liquid. If you like to spread butter thick, it might be even liquid enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t so I add a bit of oil. I use
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_oil" rel="wikipedia" title="Peanut oil">
   peanut oil
  </a>
  , but any edible with neutral flavor will work fine, just don’t add too much. You can always add more if you find butter too thick, but it is difficult to correct too liquid one. I add about a tablespoon of oil for 200g of peanuts while they are still pulverized and rarely need to add more later.
 </p>
 <p>
  On recent vacation in Nepal I also tried their peanut butter. It tastes very much like ours at this stage; right taste but like most food in Nepal not salty enough for western taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  Salt is not the only thing missing. Peanut butter is like tomato sauce, it needs a bit of sugar to get a more well rounded flavor. I used powdered sugar with some success, but maple syrup recently won me over (a tip from
  <a href="http://twitter.com/alesspetic" title="Ale? ?peti? on twitter">
   Ale?
  </a>
  whose many culinary talents include baking
  <a href="http://tweetphoto.com/cxyahdo1" title="Pumpkin cake">
   great cakes
  </a>
  ). How much salt and sugar to use is again down to personal preference. I use about 1-2 teaspoons of maple syrup and slowly salt while mixing until I am satisfied with result. Blender warms butter and spoils tasting somewhat, so I stop spicing butter when it is a bit less sweet and slightly more salted then I would prefer. This results in just the right taste when cooled.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s it. You should now have peanut butter good enough for gods. A few tries, to find the right balance between ingredients and you will end up with one fit for you too. It took me longer because I also eat it with spoon, hence it’s easier to notice its mistakes and more difficult to balance different uses (I prefer more salty butter on bread).
 </p>
 <p>
  My next goal: cashews and cocoa spread.
 </p>
 <p>

  </a>
  Hydrogenated fat is used for the same reason as oil, to make butter easier to spread. Added oil doesn’t actually react with peanuts and if you leave your butter long enough, it will eventually separate and form that unwanted oily layer on top.
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation" rel="wikipedia" title="Hydrogenation">
   Hydrogenation
  </a>
  solidifes fat and prevents that from happening. Downside is that you can’t tell how much additional fat was added unless it is specified in ingredients list and it’s even more unhealthy.

  I’ve been too busy lately and many things suffered as a consequence, writing being one of them. This is not a complaint, since I mostly had fun doing what I did, but it is becoming obvious that too much fun can kill you too. Anyhow, this is not a post discussing woes many would love to have. It’s a short list of ideas and thoughts that occurred to me recently, which I don’t have time to really think through or didn’t want to commit to

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <div>
 <p>
  As I am leaving on a short vacation that will probably take me off grid for few days, there is still a time for a hopefully short, but definitely last post of this year. I don’t like how registration forms ask me twice for password and I think I can offer a better way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most registration forms these days still want you to type password of your choice twice. They probably do it to reduce risk of mistyping it. I deeply dislike Facebook, but I think this is one thing it
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Registration form on Facebook's homepage">
   got right
  </a>
  . You only have to do it once. Those with FB accounts can see this in action if they log out for a moment and visit front page.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are several reasons why once is enough. First one is that every decent page provides a way to reset password in case you have forgotten it. So even if password was mistyped, it’s easy to reset it again to a different value. Second reason is that by now it’s quite well known that most people use a low single-digit number of passwords and don’t come up with a new one each time they are asked to do so. Hence it’s quite unlikely they’ll make an error now after so much practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third reason is that in most cases you can
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" title="Demonstration of show password switch">
   help them
  </a>
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html" style="font-size: 29.25px; line-height: 42.75px;" title="Demonstration of show password switch">
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  When registration forms first appeared internet access was rare and expensive enough that most common environment in which it was used was work or school. It was therefore likely that when you were registering for a service, you weren’t alone and entered password had to be hidden from people around you. Today it’s probably opposite. Most of the time I am quite private and could see what I type with no additional security risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  So as in demo we could offer a switch that let visitors see what they are typing if they choose to do so. It should still be hidden by default, since we can’t really tell the environment visitor is in or if Javascript is available. It is always better to err on side of safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a side note for those who might have peaked at implementation. I’m replacing password input field because of Internet Explorer, which doesn’t tolerate type attribute change on input fields. Every other browser tested (FF, Opera, Safari and Chrome) would work perfectly fine by just switching field type from password to text.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyhow, that’s it for this year. If you leave a comment, which I hope you will, and I don’t answer, it’s because I lack Internet access.
