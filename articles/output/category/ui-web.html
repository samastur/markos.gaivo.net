    I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked
    <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/" title="John's homepage">
     John Lily
    </a>
    why haven’t they integrated
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.greasespot.net/" rel="homepage" title="Greasemonkey">
     Greasemonkey
    </a>
    into
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="homepage" title="Firefox">
     Firefox
    </a>
    . Wrong question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know was:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     “Why doesn’t
     <a class="zem_slink" href="http://mozilla.com" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla">
      Mozilla
     </a>
     integrate Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?”
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It’s them who decide how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone’s computer and belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)  to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     “To whom does a browser belong to?”
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation doesn’t need to be. I find
    <a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">
     Platypus extension
    </a>
    a good first step to how a browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even further to their needs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I’m failing to find anything substantial.

    A few days ago I came to
    <a href="javascript-enabled-spiders.html">
     recognize
    </a>
    that email hiding technique I use won’t work anymore. However I still think it would be a great idea if I could remove a part of a page from search index, even if it won’t help me hide from spammers in the long run.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I’d really like is to specify which parts of a page are not its content and can be safely ignored by search engines. Ignoring it would also mean absence of those parts from search indexes. Spiders could still follow links inside those parts, because I can still use
    <em>
     robots.txt
    </em>
    file if I really want to block their traversal. In effect, I’d like a more fine-grained approach to blocking, which doesn’t force the layout of my pages to even slightly favor spiders over people.
   </p>
   <p>
    The way I imagine it would work is by simply applying a class name to the parts of the page I’d want shielded. I don’t care much (yet) if such class name would need to be specified in robots file or if it would be some name achieved by a web consensus. As far as I can see both approaches would work equally well.
   </p>
   <p>
    The benefit of this would also be better search results. Every now and then I follow a search hit that fit my query because of a combination of site content and its navigation. Judging by my logs I’m not the only deceived soul. So, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to tell which parts are content and which aren’t?
