  I bought a Samsung Nexus phone in September after almost 4 years of being a happy
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E65" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia E65">
   Nokia E65
  </a>
  user. I switched because I didn’t have an Android phone to test websites against and it would be stupid to buy something expensive just to lay on my table waiting for an occasional test.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month of use is enough to get a solid impression, but not enough to really know a modern phone. Which is alright, since I don’t want to write a pro-cons review of Android. Better ones have already been written. I am more intrigued by what design hints about its creators and their environment. Hints, not tells, because I know Android’s authors even less than I do my phone, which is to say I don’t know them at all and could well be wrong. Enough of disclaimers and let’s proceed with this Sherlock-like conjecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Data roaming is something that ought to be common, but is usually an obscenely expensive luxury and it’s nice that Android lets you turn it off to prevent unexpected expenses. However home network may not be cheap or unlimited either and what I really liked about an otherwise severely limited email client on
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900" rel="wikipedia" title="Nokia N900">
   Nokia N900
  </a>
  is that you could set automatic email retrieval to proceed only when connected to WiFi. Alas there are no connection based settings for data syncing. So this feature was designed for countries where cheap-enough data connection is available to most or in expectation that this will soon be so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notifications are an important part of Android’s experience and are done well enough to inspire iPhone’s. They are also less important to me than Android believes they should be. Pull-down notification system was obviously built for a steady stream of messages and as such would benefit from a few more options. Like K9 mail’s quiet time during which it would not check for new messages (or just be silent if it gets them). I’d also love to be able to set a different volume based on type of messages. I care about (rare) text messages, but don’t want to be bothered with Twitter’s deluge. However if I wanted to be notified about everything as soon as it happens, then I would just love what I got. I know many social media users who surely do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The under-appreciated side of Nokia has always been company’s understanding that mobile users around world are not same. Android however doesn’t care about subtleties. E.g. selecting language of your interface will also select when week starts (is it Monday or Sunday?). This would be a great shortcut for setting locale in one swoop, but is incredibly annoying when you want/need to override it.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of my examples is actually a bug or even necessary a bad (business) decision. I talked about Android, but most of what I said also applies to iPhones. While I do think smartphones will eventually end up in hands of practically all phone users, I do not believe that economies of scale or environment will work equally for all. I am not sure if designing mostly for affluent is wrong, but I do think it’s sad.

 <p>
  We came from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.corse.fr/" rel="homepage" title="Corsica">
   Corsica
  </a>
  vacation recently and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south of the island. It’s a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent an apartment in the old town itself – you might feel as a part of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typeface used for suggestions was
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans" rel="wikipedia" title="Comic Sans">
   Comic Sans
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more despised and ridiculed
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" rel="wikipedia" title="Typeface">
   typefaces
  </a>
  around. My unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than others.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?
 </p>
 <p>
  It obviously doesn’t leave people untouched, since they keep on using it when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers. I’ve also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested in type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually means) just as it doesn’t make Madonna a good singer. It does however speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply unmoved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn’t designed for.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it’s probably more because it is less general, less bland than, say,
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" rel="wikipedia" title="Times Roman">
   Times Roman
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end I have to admit I don’t have a bigger point than simple admission I’m not affronted by it anymore. I can’t muster a will to protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end harmless.

  This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won’t, look forward to.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven’t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn’t mean short on value).
 </p>
 <p>
  Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy
  <em>
   The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Pursuit of Glory
  </em>
  . Your soul will thank you for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.
