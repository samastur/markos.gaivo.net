    I’m not sure if there’s still a custom in our primary schools to go on a few days long school trip at the end of last year. I know there used to be one when I was there.
   </p>
   <p>
    We went to
    <a href="http://www.tz-vis.hr/">
     Vis
    </a>
    , a small and beautiful island in Croatia, which back then was still in the same country. It was the end of May, when sea is still very cold, at least if you’re not used to that sort of temperatures. We weren’t  and were basically stuck for a few days in a small village with nothing to do. That was back in the days, when there was no gameboys, portable DVD’s or whatever entertains kids today. However there was an ice cream parlor, where a scoop of ice cream costed only 1000 DIN compared to 2500 DIN back home.
   </p>
   <p>
    So for three days my friends and I were regularly visiting that shop, buying copious amounts of ice cream. I haven’t spent even 1 DIN on it back home, because I thought it was too expensive. I spent more than 100 000 there, because it was so ridiculously cheap and I wasn’t alone doing it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lucky for me I didn’t get a bellyache, but I did get a lesson on how cheaper pricing doesn’t necessarily equate smaller profits. Odd that music industry still

    To me the most annoying business habit is calling someone when it’s not urgent, even though you have his email address and it should be obvious from your relationship that he prefers email to other means of communication.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hated phones since I was a wee lad, but I dislike them even more now, because:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     They break my concentration; rarely for a good reason.
    </li>
    <li>
     They are invasive and inconsiderate. Just because it suits you to call me now, it doesn’t mean it suits me.
    </li>
    <li>
     Whatever is said on the phone can be denied later and sometimes is.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Leave a trail or fuck off.

    I spent a good part of last year studying things like marketing, pricing and so on, which are completely untechnical in nature, but very much essential for a success of any company. I’m far from being an expert in any of these fields, but every now and then I come across an example, that leaves me dumbfounded in its amazing stupidity. It seems like incompetence is limitless and some people receive quite a lot of money to show off theirs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Practically every textbook I’ve read taught me that the basic approach to marketing is to have a clear message of what you’re offering and why this is beneficial to people you’re selling to. With enough repetition you might have a chance of making them remember you. I certainly don’t think this is the only way to do it, but it’s probably the most tried and tested method out there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, there’s a new fashion in Slovenia. Create ads that don’t tell you anything. I’m not thinking of weird ads that don’t seem to have anything to do with a company or product they’re pushing. No, I mean ads with literally nothing on except a word like
    <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">
     IZI
    </a>
    (bastardized easy) or
    <a href="http://www.t-2.net">
     T-2
    </a>
    . I guess it might have been intriguing if it wasn’t so overused.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, last example with izi really takes the cake. First there were ads showing either just izi or if you were lucky, also a link to
    <a href="http://www.naizi.si">
     naizi.si
    </a>
    . As already mentioned, they were ads for
    <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">
     izimobil
    </a>
    . Now, go look at the
    <a href="http://www.naizi.si">
     site
    </a>
    and find anything that could point a visitor to
    <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">
     izimobil.si
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll buy you a beer, if you can do it in next 24 hours. Or any other beverage of your choice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Back? I couldn’t do it either. It’s hard to imagine there isn’t one, but it’s certainly well hidden. ’cause you know, people really want to dig around the site looking for what you’re about, right?
   </p>
   <p>
    Their ad campaign has been expanded in last day or so as they came out with jumbo ads promoting izimobil more directly and they’re trying to do so with a slogan:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     “Prvi slovenski virtualni operater mobilne telefonije.”
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Or in English:
    <strong>
     “First slovenian virtual mobile operator.”
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Say what?
   </p>
   <p>
    Was that supposed to persuade me to do something? Does virtual mean they’re not real? Which part should register as something positive with me?
   </p>
   <p>
    Apart from being almost meaningless, it’s also wrong, if being virtual alludes to using some
    <a href="http://www.mobitel.si">
     other company’s
    </a>
    mobile network.
    <a href="http://www.debitel.si/">
     Debitel
    </a>
    did it first, although not as a prepaid operator and I know of no one, who would find that fact alone appealing.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’m not saying their ad campaign won’t have positive effects. Hell, you can get them by showing dancing bananas and pie fights, as long as you’re willing to spend enough money on it. But somehow I doubt it’s an economical way to market your product.
