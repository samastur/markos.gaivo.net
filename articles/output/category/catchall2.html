            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.</p>
<p>Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.</p>
<p>It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.</p>
<p>Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.</p>
<p>You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../windows.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Windows">Windows</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I got a new <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/">travel computer</a> this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.</p>
<p>It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until <strong>everyone</strong> can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.</p>
<p>I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.</p>
<p>I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually <em>the best Windows</em> so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../books-i-read-in-2015.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Books I read in 2015">Books I read in 2015</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>2015 was a year of completely <a href="../2015-review.html">missed plans</a> and that was equally true when it came to reading. I read even fewer books than a year before, but at least I am happy with my picks. There were no complete duds and I liked almost all of them.</p>
<p>We bought a Kindle Voyager before our 3 months journey, but I did not read enough on it to form a definite opinion. I prefer to read programming books on tablet, but for everything else Kindle feels better. Paper still works best for me unless I want to make notes.</p>
<p>I have started an experiment of marking interesting parts and bookmarking them with Post-It bookmarks so I can return and transcribe them once I have finished the book. It is definitely more work than just sliding a finger across screen, but I am curious to see how this turns out. </p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. I did not provide a link for The Trial because my copy doesn't have one and I am not familiar with any of the many available editions. Bold is reserved for those I found best: <em>Missing Person, Poor Economics and The Arab of the Future</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Trial by Franz Kafka. I expected to like this book more than I did. It didn't help that (old?) Slovenian translation sounds often very germanic and that it isn't finished. Dialog is often odd and it is unlikely you'll find brilliant stylistic passages, but it may win you over with pervasive mood of desperation, alienation and impotence (absolutely not sexual).</li>
<li><a href="http://diytoolkit.org/">DIY Toolkit</a> by Nesta. A good introduction on various tools and techniques NGOs can you use for better results in their work. Most of which will be familiar to UX practitioners and some of which would benefit from a deeper introduction.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Person-Verba-Mundi-Book/dp/1567922813/">Missing Person</a> by Patrick Modiano.</strong> The kind of multi-layered books I would write if I had talent and more depth. A noirish pursuit of lost identity that is also an engaging exploration of self. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wyrd-Sisters-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552166642/">Wyrd Sisters</a> by Terry Pratchett. Started reading after I learned about Terry's death to console myself. It worked and the book lost none of its charm since I last read it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/">Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</a> by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.</strong> Absolutely fantastic book that everyone with even slight interest in international aid should read. I wish I had a copy of it with me at all times so I could throw it at anyone feeling the urge to pontificate on failings of the poor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Crown-Tiffany-Aching/dp/0062429973/">The Shepherd's Crown</a> by Terry Pratchett. Last Discworld book, the only series I ever read. It was difficult to read about death of a character I liked for almost two decades. Terry died before he finished polishing text and it shows. It is not among his great, but it is a decent finish at a difficult time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arab-Future-Childhood-1978-1984-Graphic/dp/1627793445/">The Arab of the Future</a> by Riad Sattouf.</strong> A controversial portrait of author's early childhood in Libya, France and Syria full of humor, humanism and barbed observations that may not be to everyone's liking. But they were to mine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058">Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration</a> by Brian Fitzpatrick &amp; Ben Collins-Sussman. Book with some useful advice that for me did not live up to its praise as I found most of it obvious or out of scope. I got really annoyed by its common use of female pronouns in negative contexts which is especially annoying in so male-dominated industry and its reliance on personal opinions where there has been ample research  (e.g. open spaces).</li>
</ul>
<p>This year will be busy, but I would still like to pick up the pace and read at least 15. Hopefully some of them will be fiction, but mostly I will read to learn and not for pleasure.</p>
