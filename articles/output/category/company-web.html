            <div class="entry-content post-text">

 <p>
  A few days ago I read about
  <a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/">
   IndieKarma
  </a>
  on Jason Kottke’s
  <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/05/indiekarma-micropayments">
   blog
  </a>
  . I agree with most of his remarks and I have a couple of my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dislike the fact that IndieKarma is another walled garden. It means that both the content publisher and visitor must use the same system for transaction to occur and that’s a lot to ask. Building a more open system, which would allow transactions between parties belonging to different systems and wouldn’t be prone to abuse, is difficult and is probably one of the reasons why it hasn’t happened yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I think it’s also a necessity for small companies like
  <a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/About.xhtml">
   PixelPass
  </a>
  , since as a visitor I’m unlikely to use more than a couple of such systems. Same goes for me as a publisher. If my reach is limited to websites using same service as me, then they’ll have a hard time getting traction. It will also be impossible to compete with big boys if they decide to move in this space.
 </p>
 <p>
  IndieKarma is also a very apt name for a service that by its very nature is completely voluntary. Even if it was widely used on websites, it wouldn’t amount to much without people willing to spend money when they don’t have to. I’m sure there are lots of well-intentioned folks out there, but the enormous prevalence of ad supported services and the fact that most users
  <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/will-your-web-app-make-money">
   will be freeloaders
  </a>
  makes me doubtful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, it’s a nice idea with approach that might work. I certainly hope it does.

  I caught an interesting
  <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/02/web_apps_single_point_of_subpo.html">
   observation
  </a>
  on O’Reilly’s Radar. In my opinion there are two problems that web users should pay attention to. One, as noted on Radar, is privacy and the other is reliability of your service provider.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are limits to what we can do about either of them as a company. We built Marela on a fault-tolerant system using solid hardware and think user’s data is reasonably safe from data loss and intrusions. Like others we can’t rule it out completely, but I think it was worth it to build a safer system than our competition even if users often don’t care (until it’s too late).
 </p>
 <p>
  We also don’t collect any personal data we don’t actually need and don’t store what we do collect a minute longer than absolutely necessary. However, there’s little we can do about our legal obligations. Even though legislation in Slovenia is not quite the same as the one cited in the article, it’s still true that it’s easier for law-enforcement institutions to legally access your data (unknown to you) if it’s not residing on your personal computer. We are eating our own dog food, so this doesn’t make us happy either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still think it’s dumb to have all your data stored only on your personal computer, especially since vast majority of computer users seldom if ever make backups. Encryption can go a long way in protecting data from prying eyes, but what I wish most is simply for people to be more aware.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without awareness there’s little hope for improving the legislation and practices of our industry.
