    Dear
    <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">
     Simon,
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you’re reading this, then Technorati trick has worked. Thanks

    </a>
    and hooray for modern tools. If you’re not Simon, then you’re lost. Sorry.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve sent you a couple of emails since our conversation at FOWA and they didn’t seem to reach you. Probably just stuck in a spam filter as I refuse to believe they are being ignored.
   </p>
   <p>
    So could you please
    <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/">
     contact me
    </a>
    instead and let me know how to reach you? Any method, even hand written letters, is fine by me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks.

    It’s been more than a month since I got my Nokia 770. In that time, I went through numerous spontaneous reboots, which culminated in one never ending reboot loop after an unsuccessful software install in which I lost my Mahjong best times and a collection of ideas for a project at work. I can’t make it connect to company wireless (although at home it works just fine) and built in email client is a piece of crap that barely satisfies the need to check email. There’s no good way to synchronize data (address book etc.) with other devices and I see no reason why included editor can’t handle any text file.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, I absolutely love this gadget to the point, where my wife jokes about being jealous.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve been thinking about this ever since I flashed the device yesterday. Why is it so alluring to me?
   </p>
   <p>
    Gadgets are not living beings and there’s no charm in their faults. There certainly are many of them, but there’s also a lot to like. Display is fantastic and reading web pages or pdf files finally doesn’t hurt. Those two tasks were the reason I bought it in the first place, so it’s performing its main function quite well. I like the way I can transform it in a little computer with a portable bluetooth keyboard
    <br/>
    that lets me do practically anything. I don’t play games much, but I like those available. I was fine with declared battery time and I’m
    <br/>
    absolutely delighted my 770 like a Duracell bunny easily exceeds it. I’ve got a feeling I can make it do whatever I want, limited mostly by my practically non-existent free time.
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess I like it so much simply because getting more than expected is good enough.

    There’s hardly a worse way to end a vacation than catching a flu. There are also better starts to flu then midnight spells of vomiting, when your stomach is completely empty. All you do is spit acid and brush teeth afterwards in hope they might stick around a bit longer.

    The good thing is that it beats catching malaria, which I hopefully didn’t, and that it only gets better onwards. I seem to be left only with a slight cold and a nasty
    <strong>
     <em>censored</em>
    </strong>
    problem that I’m hoping will disappear in next few days. I’m almost through my unread emails as well so if you’ve sent me something and haven’t heard from me yet, this would be a good time to send me a reminder.
    <br/>
    This vacation has been very much unlike the others. It was the first time in years, well, since I started working really, that I didn’t work at all while being on vacation. I didn’t think of work either, an odd experience I enjoyed with gusto.
    <br/>
    Still, a long way home provided ample opportunity for reflection, hazy thoughts and dubious decisions one of which is that I’m going to rewrite this site and create my own publishing platform, which will be better suited than those known to me for things I need and things I’d like to try out.
    <br/>
    I’ve also given myself a deadline, a year, in which to come up with this thing. A deadline that I think provides enough time to hope for sucess and not enough to slack.
    <br/>
    What won’t change is the low frequency of my posts, a belief strengthened by wading through hundreds of unread posts accumulated in my feed reader while I was gone, majority of which being little more than a waste of time. But who am I to complain.
