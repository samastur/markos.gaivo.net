  I started playing with AJAX before it got its silly name and true to X I used XML in my application. At least at first.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I discovered is that flicker caused by processing data and simultaneously writing results to document can be completely removed if I do a Google and fetch javascript object instead (what later became
  <a href="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/index.html">
   JSON
  </a>
  ) and use that. Difference was so vivid, I dropped XML almost completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fast forward to autumn. There’s a debate after our regular weekly talk and a question comes up. Why would Google or anyone else for that matter choose to use something else than XML?
 </p>
 <p>
  Relying on personal experience I offered speed as obvious and most important reason. I couldn’t back it up, but since I’ve seen it with my own eyes, I didn’t doubt it either. It wasn’t the sole reason. I find dabbling with javascript objects simply easier than handling XML and I’ll care about XSLT when javascript in Safari can access it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got reminded of our discussion when I read
  <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2005/11/30/tuning-ajax-performance.html">
   this article
  </a>
  . Read it, if you haven’t yet, because it’s well worth it. Anyhow, I decided to make a new test. I wrote a simple
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/test.html">
   test page
  </a>
  , that fetches
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/jssample.raw">
   sample json file
  </a>
  and basically equal
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jsbench/xmlsample.xml">
   xml sample
  </a>
  and measures how much time it takes to fetch same data.
 </p>
 <p>
  Result?
 </p>
 <p>
  After 15 minutes of wild reloading in different browsers (Safari 1.3+, FF1.0, IE6) and different local and non-local servers, I can’t see a difference that couldn’t be attributed to latency. It seems browsers have moved on and there’s little reason to avoid using XML today.
 </p>
 <p>
  So use whatever you like most.

  I’ve been looking for Javascript localization resources on Google and came up fairly empty handed. There seems to be
  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MultilingualWebsites3.asp#4">
   little
  </a>
  useful information and even less useful code. The only thing I found, that is actually usable, is a
  <a href="http://johnnydebris.net/javascripts/i18n.js?frames=no" title="Link to javascript i18n library">
   library
  </a>
  by Guido Wesdorp.
 </p>
 <p>
  I find this utterly amazing after a decade of Javascript being in wide use, although I probably shouldn’t be. A likely explanation for this is that Javascript is most often used for short scripts inside web pages. If used on a multilingual website, it’s usually fairly easy to have separate javascript files for each language.
 </p>
 <p>
  I expect this will change with rise of more complicated, involved web applications. However, so far AJAX toolkits that seem to spring up these days like mushrooms after rain, have been busy with obviously more important things like animations.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could be wrong. In fact, I hope I’m wrong. Is there a javascript i18n library with following characteristics:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   easy to use
  </li>
  <li>
   supports translation of javascript code and HTML
  </li>
  <li>
   small and relatively fast
  </li>
  <li>
   translations are separated from HTML and javascript code
  </li>
  <li>
   handles properly nodes with superfluous whitespace and those where it can’t be collapsed
  </li>
  <li>
   supports translation of nodes with other HTML tags as ancestors (not only text nodes)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Guido’s library is a good tool that meets many of these needs, but sadly not all of them. Writing my own one seems to be the only solution.

  <strong>
   Update: I
   <a href="hide-email-address-from-spammers-with-javascript-a-new-attempt.html">
    published
   </a>
   a new, more safe but less friendly version of this script.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wouldn’t it be nice, if you could post your email address on your web site without worrying spammers will pick it up?
 </p>
 <p>
  Now you can, by applying a little bit of javascript to your web page. Just import
  <a href="/blog/code/mangle.js" title="Javascript file with mangle function">
   this javascript file
  </a>
  in head of your document and call
  <em>
   mangle()
  </em>
  inside your onload handler. What it does, is replace elements of form
  <br/>
  <code>
   <br/>
   &lt;span class="change"&gt;billg at microsoft dot com&lt;/span&gt;
  </code>
  <br/>
  with
  <br/>
  <code>
   <br/>
   &lt;a href="mailto:billg@microsoft.com"&gt;billg@microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are few caveats to its use. You’re not allowed to use any HTML tag inside of span blocks, which have class set to change. The script also expects such blocks to have only one class definition. If change is only part of class attribute value, this script won’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are free to use script as you please and to make any changes necessary. But if you choose to replace “at” and “dot” as delimiters, pick replacements that make address easily recognizable for those who don’t use javascript.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Note: The reason why this script works is that spammers use programs which search for email like pattern in page. They don’t interpret pages using javascript interpreter, since it would make collecting addresses significantly slower and more expensive.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Update: Jay Samec let me know there’s a bug in my code, since it didn’t handle emails with multiple dots (e.g. those with subdomains). Script has been fixed now.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Update 2: Holger Rindermann pointed out another bug and provided a patch to fix it that is now a part of the script.
  </em>
