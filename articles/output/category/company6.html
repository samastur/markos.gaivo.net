  One of the downsides of running your own company is that you have to get familiar with things you could never care for and amazingly often make sense only to really twisted bureaucratic minds.

  In Slovenia, if you collect personal information of any kind, you have to register such database 15 days before its first use with
  <a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/index.php?id=2243&amp;L=1">
   Inspectorate for Personal Data Protection
  </a>
  . I’m all in favor of laws protecting personal information and in general I think Slovenian laws are not too bad in that regard. But if inspectorate by their

  rarely inspects cases that weren’t reported to them and all such inspections seem to be limited to state institutions, what good is such register than anyway? How does it protect anyone?
 </p>
 <p>
  You can read online
  <a href="http://www2.gov.si/mp/katalogz.nsf/(wwwUpravljavci)?OpenView&amp;Count=30" title="Online register">
   a list
  </a>
  of companies that registered their databases together with a short summary of what kind of data they collect and what for. I’ve checked a company where I administered such database for two and a half years (never experienced an inspection of any kind) and it’s quite clear that no one actually checks if provided information is true or complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  What you’re left with is another meaningless obligation you have to fulfill. Preferably by sending them email with data AND a printed form (email only is not allowed). Nice. You can do more work so they don’t have to.

  E-government Slovenian style.

  My blog has become one of many showing ads from Google. As many have said it before me, I did this mainly to learn more about them and their effectiveness. Honest. Volume of traffic on this site is simply too low to expect more money than maybe, just maybe enough to buy a CD every few months or so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact is that we’re thinking about ad based business models (not for this blog, but the service that’s coming up really soon now), but we lack experience with click-through based models and I believe this site might be a good enough test case to learn more about them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have a request for you. I’m not looking for sympathy clicks and would really appreciate it, if all clicks were generated because of your personal interest in presented offers. I might earn more otherwise, but I won’t learn what I want.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you.
