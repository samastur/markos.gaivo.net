  I returned from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" rel="wikipedia" title="Costa Rica">
   Costa Rica
  </a>
  two days ago after a month spent there. It’s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn’t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote
  <a href="2009-review.html" title="Last year's review">
   my yearly review
  </a>
  and it’s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn’t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess it’s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as

  </a>
  , which was mostly
  <a href="http://fry.si/outbreak/" title="Fry's homepage">

  </a>
  work anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn’t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won’t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO

  while travelling than last year.

 <p>
  I am more optimistic about next year.

  wasn’t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I’ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.

 <p>
  There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I
  <a href="sabbatical.html">
   plan
  </a>
  to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years…Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).
 </p>
 <p>
  I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133" rel="amazon" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich">
   4 hour work week
  </a>
  , which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why
  <sup>
   [
   <a href="#book-1">
    1
   </a>
   ]
  </sup>
  again draws no sympathy from me.
 </p>
 <p>
  So….What do I want?
 </p>
 <p>
  I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/" rel="homepage" title="Pixel Qi">

  </a>
  will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.

 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to

  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn’t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don’t, you really ought to find something. I’ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you’ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.
 </p>
 <p>
  I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can – in time and geography. I haven’t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.
