  Sometimes, I really am an idiot. A couple of years ago I was involved in development of a front-end Zope application for a major Slovenian ISP with more than 100 000 users. No matter what we did, Zope just wasn’t fast. In fact it was so slow, it was soon abandoned for one more suitable solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  The failure of our project was largely my fault, because I haven’t made sure Zope was a good fit for what we wanted. I learned a lot, but it also left a bitter aftertaste and a question, why are people using it?
 </p>
 <p>
  The obvious answer is of course, because it DOES fit their needs. It’s just that they are not building a site or an application that needs to handle few hundred simultaneous requests. They handle a few at most, so Zope or Plone or what-have-you is more than speedy enough and it’s their features that count.
 </p>
 <p>
  It really took me awhile to grasp this and it only became really clear this week, after reading a little
  <a href="http://www.larsen-b.com/Article/217.html">
   Plone benchmark
  </a>
  and having a discussion with
  <a href="http://seba.antiwisdom.com" title="Sebastjan's blog">
   Sebastjan
  </a>
  about slowness of Slovenian sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a positive note, we generate pages in less than 6 ms now and can reduce it even further, if needed.

  Until recently I’ve been using Python 2.3.x almost exclusively and I thought it was about time I get more familiar with what 2.4 series has to offer. I’ve skimmed the list of new features when point zero version came out and found some things that I like (e.g sets) and some that I disliked (e.g. decorators).
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this time I invested a bit more time to actually read and understand what was on offer and how these features came about. I still haven’t found a need or a sympathy for decorators, although I can see why some people want them. Personally, I believe they’ll more likely be a cause for less readable and harder to understand Python code than they prove to be useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still think Python is a wonderful language, but gone are the days when I was looking forward to each release and goodness it brought. These days I’m afraid to look and discover another feature that helps more with keeping habits from other languages than adding something new and genuinely useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like minimalism in all things and therefore see every new feature as a burden that should be more than offset by its usefulness. I’m not a language designer and hence can’t really say or tell if Python is going down the wrong track, but there is something that I find most annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been thinking about languages quite a lot recently; how we use and abuse them and what impact our language proficiency has on our communications. There’s one thing I find very different with programming languages than those used for normal human interaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s very little optional about them.
 </p>
 <p>
  It really gets my goat when a language feature is defended as being optional. You may have a choice in using a feature, but you certainly don’t get a choice in learning and understanding its use. Even if you don’t use it yourself, you’ll quite likely have to interact with somebody else’s code, which does and unlike with English, it’s not enough to just get a sense of meaning from its context. You actually have to really understand what it does and hence need to be familiar with feature itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might still be worthwhile to add it, but let’s not pretend when we do that it’s completely optional.
 </p>
 <p>
  P.S: Isn’t it amazing that after all these years, we still have a global interpreter lock? Wouldn’t it be better if we worked on removing that disgrace?

  I’ve been a Python programmer for more than 6 years now and during most of this time it’s been the language I used professionally. It’s safe to say, I know it fairly well and I’m quite attached to it. I also have to admit that I can’t stand Twisted and Zope.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a continuous wonder for me, why Python community chooses to promote projects that feel most unpythonic to me. I became addicted to Python, because it was a very simple, yet expressive language which lived up to its mantra of making easy things easy and hard things possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  So what is actually easy with Twisted and Zope? Practically nothing. At least not as long as you don’t dedicate yourself to their use.
 </p>
 <p>
  You see, Twisted and Zope are not products. They are religions.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were not built in a way that would make it easy to integrate them with wonderful things others built. It’s not easy to just pick the parts you like and use them elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, like a good disciple you were supposed to study the way they work, use their new vocabulary and dedicate yourself to live within confines of chosen religion. If you do this, then you’ll get some payoff and you might after a while even think you enjoy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But you’ll be missing on a hell of a lot of stuff others made and you’ll have to live with limitations of not your choosing. Well, at least not completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess I wouldn’t find it so distressing, if I didn’t feel Python developers are getting too eager to add new features to please Zope and Twisted developers. Or features that were inspired by these two.
 </p>
 <p>
  So this language I loved is with each new release becoming ever less clean and beautiful and it’s getting easier and easier to imagine a day, when I’ll switch to some other language as my main development tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Disclaimer: When I talked about Zope, I actually meant version 2.x, because it was the one I actually used on a project and left me scared badly enough that I can’t make myself to even check X3. I heard it’s better in many regards, but I really don’t care anymore.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  I also think developers who created Zope and Twisted are amazing. I just think that their product is, well, unpleasant.
