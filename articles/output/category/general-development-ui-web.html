    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://bokardo.com" rel="blog" title="Joshua Porter">
     Joshua Porter’s
    </a>
    workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that’s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" rel="homepage" title="Facebook Connect">
     Facebook Connect
    </a>
    as Facebook “owning” their users.
   </p>
   <p>
    They are right, but it doesn’t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.
   </p>
   <p>
    My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?
   </p>
   <p>
    There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Awareness -&gt; Sign-up -&gt; First-time use -&gt; Engagement -&gt; Referral
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using Facebook Connect (or
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://oauth.net" rel="homepage" title="OAuth">
     OAuth
    </a>
    ,
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://openid.net" rel="homepage" title="OpenID Foundation">
     OpenID
    </a>
    …) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It’s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to “full” members to make such commitment more enticing.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?
   </p>
   <p>
    Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.
   </p>
   <p>
    All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I’ll let you know how it went.

    I’ve been writing less lately, which had little to do with summer laziness and more with me thinking about publishing on the web.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many have said that Internet (or Web) is not a television, but neither is it a magazine or a book. Yet I find myself again and again leaning on preconceptions picked up from my favorite medium. So this summer has been spent exploring my preconceived notions and trying to find out which of them still make sense on the web and how to tackle those which don’t.
   </p>
   <p>
    And the result of this exploration? I still don’t like WordPress, so I might go about writing my own publishing platform which would offer me an opportunity to test some of newfound ideas. Or I won’t, recognizing vast amount of time needed and I’ll end up only writing an article or two. But what I’m certain I will do is write less.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a world where every monkey can publish so almost every one of us eventually does restraint is a virtue. There were too many posts that neither benefited me nor those who came across them. Maybe I won’t change the signal-noise ratio, but I will put less crap out there in absolute terms.
   </p>
   <p>
    Related to all these thinking is a recent announcement of
    <a href="http://hyperscope.org/">
     HyperScope
    </a>
    . Doug Engelbart’s vision of
    <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augment-132082.opml">
     Open Hyperdocument System
    </a>
    (link may not work in every browser) has been a source of many ideas this summer and it’s certainly nice to finally have available a system to test at least some of them.

    Yesterday I talked about influence of language and tag design on ratio between the number of unique and all tags. I haven’t discussed why this number would be interesting and what would it tell us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let’s start with a simple graph:
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="Tag space" class="image" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/tag-graph.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Blue circles represent objects. Connections represent tags and rectangulars are pages with hits for a specific unique tag. As we can see, all images but one have two tags (number of connections from a circle) and the most popular tag is attached to 4 images (number of connections from a rectangular).
   </p>
   <p>
    What ratio tells us is an average frequency of a given tag (how many connections does a typical rectangular have). The higher it is, more hits will be returned by search.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, tag connections and rectangulars also form a path between objects. Therefore higher ratio also means a better connected graph with (again on average) shorter paths between different objects. For example if we look at the red path on example graph then left top object is at least two clicks away from the top one and at least four clicks away from the bottom right one.
   </p>
   <p>
    If tag browsing and searching are main methods of exploration, then a loner like the most right circle is practically unreachable and more tags an object has, the better chances it has to be discovered.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, I presented a very simplified graph with a fairly even distribution of tags. Normally you wouldn’t have this. A word like cat is far more likely to be used as a tag than something like hippopotamus resulting in creation of super-nodes with far more connections to objects than system’s tag frequency ratio.
   </p>
   <p>
    With time you’d also expect this ratio to grow. Vocabulary, especially of commonly used words, is far more limited than number of pictures people can take and with time it becomes harder to create a unique tag. Flickr has tens or even hundred millions of tags, but certainly far less unique ones.
   </p>
   <p>
    Graph topography and things like super-nodes not only skew the picture, they can also change the perception and application use. I’ll write more about how in few months, when there will be more knowing and less guessing.
