    I’m usually quite fond of weekends. There’s never a good reason for it, since they’ve looked like normal working days for quite some months now. But the feeling of a time off still lingers and I’m usually happy when it’s Friday.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’m also quite happy that there are only few more hours of this hellish weekend, when nothing went right. Among other things, I got so exhausted  that I slept straight for almost 12 hours (personal record) and I got acquainted really well with spinning wheel on my Powerbook. Probable cause: dying disk at time when that’s least needed. One more thing made by Apple (beside iMac and iPod) that I need to take to service when I get around to it.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, not much work has been done in last few days and I won’t be able to finish even what I promised to do.  This never fails to annoy me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have been thinking, while strolling around lake,  about when to reveal our very buzzword compliant service to the greater public. Is the right time when it’s finally useful, but still obviously inspired by other services found on web or is it better to wait half a year or so,  when it will gain the really interesting parts?
   </p>
   <p>
    I still think the right time is this autumn, even though this will lead to accusations of plagiarism. At this point they won’t be really unfounded even if I believe we are just borrowing ideas from others to build something interesting and different (hopefully somebody will someday return the compliment).
   </p>
   <p>
    However, it would be good  to see how others react to what we build and to fix things now  when this can be done more easily then if we wait longer. I also learned the importance of releasing things to keep developers motivated and at least somewhat happy. Nobody likes to be completely irrelevant.  At last, there’s also the ever present problem of money.
   </p>
   <p>
    If anybody actually gets around to reading this, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this subject. What do you prefer, big bang revelation or evolution of service?

    Back from Ireland, a place everyone should visit at least once. If you have time, take a few days to explore Dublin and travel to west coast. Those like me, who find abundance of national pride and flags creepy, might skip Northern Ireland.
   </p>
   <p>
    New development posts might take few days to appear, while I catch up with everything.

    This is a first post on my new development oriented blog.
   </p>
   <p>
    I returned from @media2005 yesterday, where I got the feeling that either you have a blog on which you share your thoughts and possible insights or you have no good way to join the discussion except few times a year on conferences like the last one, which certainly can’t be and isn’t enough.
   </p>
   <p>
    Therefore I decided to make a new start, this time in English and about subjects where I might have a bit more interesting things to say than what happened to my non-existant cat.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, welcome to anyone who happened to come to this place and I hope you’ll find it at least mildly useful, if not entertaining.
