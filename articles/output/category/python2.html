    It’s here. After months of hoping and weeks of waiting, little white-green computer is finally here, on my desk:

    It’s too early for anything but first impressions, but unlike some people mine are completely positive. This doesn’t mean everything works. It doesn’t like WPA-enabled wifi in our flat. Some parts are a bit flaky or unfinished. But on the whole I haven’t found problems yet that weren’t already documented on project’s wiki and in general it certainly works better than I expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    Time will tell if this infatuation will last, although I don’t see why not, since it offers everything I hoped for my projects. As a side note, if you live in Slovenia and someone sends you G1G1, be prepared to pay VAT also for the one that was bought abroad and shipped elsewhere. Yet another thing beyond my comprehension.

    I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who’s a recent Python convert and he was explaining to me which parts of Python are not to his liking. Mostly he had reasonable objections.
   </p>
   <p>
    I can understand his wish for strong typing, but since lack of it is not a problem that affected me yet, I’m not bothered by it. I’ll take his word that objects pickled on Windows are not transferable to Linux and that certainly can suck. But it was probably the smallest problem that resonated the strongest with me, since it was something that has annoyed me previously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bisect module doesn’t let you specify comparison function. It obviously doesn’t need to, since you can define your own comparison methods on your classes, but still, it would be nice if its documentation included a hint for those who won’t look at module’s code or think of simply trying. You know, people like me.
   </p>
   <p>
    It got me thinking that I don’t find all modules in standard library of the same quality and I suspect I’m not the only one. I don’t mean to or honestly can disparage anyone, since I haven’t seen any code in standard library that would be worse than mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, which modules do you think would benefit from some work and how could an eager person, with some time on his hands, help them improve?
