  I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that has stopped working, please let me know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn rich-text editing on. It’s hard to imagine that it simply doesn’t exist.

  End of December is a time when I usually try to take stock of year behind and create semi-plausible goals for upcoming year. I didn’t used to do this until some day, a few years ago, I noticed that my twenties were gone. Since then it has become a habit that has served me well.
 </p>
 <p>
  My biggest achievement this year is successfully suing myself. If this sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. It would take too long to explain why I came to do this, but it goes to show how far you sometimes have to go to please some bureaucrat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I worked a lot, to the point of postponing all my last years plans and didn’t get much in return. I honestly can’t say I learned a lot and I achieved even less of what I’m proud of. This year has simply been a professional disappointment that I have no intention of repeating again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course I didn’t just wake up and discover my failures and failings. They’ve been apparent to me for a while and I spent a large part of last few months thinking about what interests me and what I want, can and will try to do. I tried to form my
  <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">
   personal research agenda
  </a>
  , but failing to get specific enough I have decided to spend next year learning about and exploring my areas of interest and see what I can come up with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creating content, while popular, still feels awkward and limited. As a
  <a href="http://www.lego.com" title="Greatest toys ever">
   LEGO
  </a>
  fan since childhood I want to see if I can come up with a set of metaphors and building blocks that yield great power of expression. The point isn’t a tool for a perfect expression of an idea as much as it is an adequate expression of most ideas. Polishing can and should come later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got Beautiful Evidence by
  <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">
   Edward Tufte
  </a>
  a few days ago and it’s an astonishing book covering another topic I feel needs more (of my) attention. When we manage to create something, we often fail to present our ideas properly. Partly it’s our fault since we can’t help ourselves not to rely on forms and traditions that came before web. It’s also our tools fault. When all you have is a blog, everything has to be squeezed onto a timeline.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re over-focusing on primary creations. As a reader I’m usually quite limited in what I can do with a piece. These days I can make a vague statement with voting or less vague one with a comment. I may also forward a find, but that’s about it. My actions are by and large limited to statements about a piece instead of interacting directly with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m sure none of above mentioned problems is new or unexplored. Smart people out there have certainly done wonderful stuff I haven’t heard of yet. Any pointers are always welcome. So next year I’ll work less, learn more (about it) and spend time playing with ideas that might appear. Hopefully I’ll have something to show in year’s time. Who knows, with a bit of luck I might even have something useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before I leave, let me wish everyone merry holidays and a happy new year.

</p>

<p>For better or worse I always tried to keep this blog fairly empty of
personal content and as short and straight to the point as I can muster.
This post breaks both rules. I know this because I wrote this paragraph
last and all secrets of this post have already been revealed to me. So
if you don't enjoy reading long tracts of personal thoughts, you better
stop now.</p>
<p>Brad Neuberg recently published<br>
<a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">a post</a><br>
that really got to me. I am not a computer scientist and I don't
pretend to be one. I do enjoy the act of programming, but unlike many
programmers I know, it's not enough to make me feel fulfilled. My work
needs to have a meaning I can relate to and challenges I want to solve.</p>
<p>He writes about a need to set your own Personal Research Agenda and I
couldn't agree more. Making the list puts in perspective what you're
doing and where you actually want to go. Even if you can't always work
towards your goals, and I guess most of us have to compromise, it's good
if we are at least zigzagging in the right direction.</p>
<p>Hence I've been thinking of my list since and while I haven't come as
far as Brad in postulating problems I would like to work on, I do have a
general sense of what I want to do and how close I am to doing it. I'm
not surprised by my slow progress, since I was always inept at deciding
what I want to do with my life apart from remaining<br>
<a href="http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000452.html">green</a><br>
. So how am I doing these days, if I take everything I've said so far
into an account?</p>
<p>I'm not doing that great.</p>
<p>As those who have tried to contact me in the last few months already
know, I am very busy these days. However, having a lot of work isn't the
same as having challenging work and I can't really say that my work is
challenging. This will change, probably even fairly soon, but it looks
unlikely I'll deal with challenges I want to solve. So that's strike one
in baseball lingo.</p>
<p>Am I working on problems that have meaning to me?</p>
<p>I loved books since I have learned to read and through the years have
only become more fascinated with the medium and what was being done with
it. When I look at web, I feel we're only at mere beginning and I would
like to explore more of what can be done with it. Probably because of my
fairly reclusive nature I care more about malleability of published
content than currently more fashionable explorations of ways to discover
it.</p>
<p>I am also similarly intrigued by mobile internet. As most people these
days I own a programmable mobile phone and unlike most I also<br>
<a href="nokia-770-internet-tablet.html">own</a><br>
a tablet. I don't often find time to think about what I could do with
them, but when I do, I just get flooded with ideas I'd like to try.</p>
<p>I can't talk about my work yet, but I can safely say that last two
paragraphs don't describe it. Strike two.</p>
<p>What's left is learning new things. I can't honestly say I haven't
learned anything lately. I've certainly spent plenty of time doing it.
Sadly I have remarkably little to show for it. Thinking about the
discrepancy between effort and time put in and results, I came to the
conclusion that I've simply spent too much time dealing with transient
problems of tools used that produce little residual knowledge. I gained
most by exploring subjects I won't work on.</p>
<p>That's strike three and out.</p>
