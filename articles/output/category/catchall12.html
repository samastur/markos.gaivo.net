  I’m back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn’t publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are places where I’ve been, places where I wouldn’t like to go again and places like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="wikipedia" title="Namibia">
   Namibia
  </a>
  , where you ask yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country and its fantastic people, so I won’t even try where so many have failed before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn’t miss it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia. Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3 letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other news I will be giving a talk at Web 2.0 Expo in
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" rel="wikipedia" title="Berlin">
   Berlin
  </a>
  on 23rd titled “Easy Deployment of Site-Extensions with a Browser Plugin”. If Berlin is too far, then you can also hear it this coming Wednesday at 19.00 in Kiberpipa at our regular Spletne urice talks.

  I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that has stopped working, please let me know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn rich-text editing on. It’s hard to imagine that it simply doesn’t exist.
