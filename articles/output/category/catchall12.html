  I use
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://gmail.com" rel="homepage" title="Gmail">
   Gmail
  </a>
  mainly for reading mailing lists. I’m old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control it, but otherwise I can’t fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can’t). Go to the Lab tab in settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type is:unread in search box and confirm.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists unread messages. It’s not perfect though. It won’t show you how many messages are unread and you can’t subscribe to it through
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Message Access Protocol">
   IMAP
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The other thing that is not perfect is
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://docs.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google Docs">
   Google Docs
  </a>
  , which I quite like. I did encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I imagine it might be in not too distant future.
 </p>
 <p>
  How do you move documents between accounts?
 </p>
 <p>
  What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it seems I can’t transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is not only not obvious, but also doesn’t work all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would love to hear them.

  I’m back from much needed and very appreciated vacation, which I didn’t publicize in advance in an old-fashioned hope not to give tips to burglars. Sensible or not, we still have our stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are places where I’ve been, places where I wouldn’t like to go again and places like
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="wikipedia" title="Namibia">
   Namibia
  </a>
  , where you ask yourself, how many times will you make it back before you die. Many eloquent people have tried to describe appeal of this beautiful country and its fantastic people, so I won’t even try where so many have failed before, but if you have a chance to visit, you really shouldn’t miss it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did see something I would like to see replicated here in Slovenia. Every government car in Namibia has a green registration plate with 3 letters that either describe part of the government it belongs to, or have GRN as a catchall category. Here, only police and defense forced have their own plates, but it would be really great if every car bought by state would have a plate that would clearly mark to which department it belongs. This way taxpayers could get an impression on how many cars out there are paid by them and what kind. More transparency can only be good.

 <p>
  In other news I will be giving a talk at Web 2.0 Expo in
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" rel="wikipedia" title="Berlin">
   Berlin
  </a>
  on 23rd titled “Easy Deployment of Site-Extensions with a Browser Plugin”. If Berlin is too far, then you can also hear it this coming Wednesday at 19.00 in Kiberpipa at our regular Spletne urice talks.
