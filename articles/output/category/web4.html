  Q: How can you tell that you’re at tech conference?

  A: The line in front of men’s toilets is longer.

  has finished. It was great and I specially enjoyed presentations given by
  <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">
   Nate Koechley
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">
   Andy Clarke
  </a>
  . Those two alone made going worthwhile and if you have a chance to see any of them, don’t miss the opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conference was much bigger this year, which is one thing I didn’t like. It was harder to find people you were looking for and even if you did find them, they were usually already occupied by somebody else. If you’re an introverted guy like me and not a natural orator, then it can be a bit difficult to make the most of the time you have. I didn’t, but I’m glad I finally met
  <a href="http://www.clagnut.com/">
   Richard
  </a>
  , who’s an even nicer guy in real life.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/">
    Eric Meyer
   </a>
   talked about last 10 years of CSS. An interesting talk, but for me even more important, he explained to me why
   <a href="css-margin-collapse.html">
    margin collapsing
   </a>
   wasn’t a daft idea.
  </li>
  <li>
   I went to a design panel with
   <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">
    Jon Hicks
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php">
    Veerle Pieters
   </a>
   and
   <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">
    Cameron Moll
   </a>
   , since I know a thing or two about Javascript, but I’m completely design illiterate, which this blog can only attest to. I can’t say how designers liked it, but it was certainly very educational for me. I knew I choose my colors as if I was colorblind, but I also discovered I need to learn more about grids.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">
    Dave Shea
   </a>
   gave a nice rundown of the state of web typography and pros and cons of different methods and Andy Budd entertainingly as always presented tricks and approaches to tackling browser bugs.

   talked about Web 2.0 and new applications and although he made quite a lot of good points, I’m not sure openness wins every time. My counter example would be instant messaging, where GTalk hasn’t changed the field much. I hope I’m wrong and this will change in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
   Day two started with
   <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">
    Dan Cederholm’s
   </a>
   interesting presentation, where I again learned a trick or two. I especially enjoyed the way to build scalable arrows using CSS.
  </li>
  <li>
   Dan’s talk was followed with Javascript panel. Personally, I think the idea of centralized hosting of Javascript libraries to improve caching doesn’t make much sense. If nothing else you bet that your visitors will also be able to access your caching sites which might not always be true. It certainly isn’t in this part of the world, where partial break-downs are not all that uncommon. Still, the panel probably deserves its own post.
  </li>
  <li>
   Cameron Moll also gave a presentation on the state of mobile web design. It wasn’t bad, but I hoped for more.
  </li>
  <li>
   Nate Koechley’s talk was a revelation. An incredible amount of good information and it’s been eye opening for me to learn about Yahoo’s experience. Scary that they build an internet explorer emulating layer for Yahoo Mail though (why didn’t they just drop the original code and start over?).
  </li>
  <li>
   I enjoyed last year’s session with Andy Clarke, so I decided to attend this years as well and I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve been a fan of Andy’s work for quite some time now and I’m definitely buying his book when it comes out. So should you.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, this is it. I hope to be there again next year.

            <div class="entry-content post-text">

  A Marela member notified us, that file upload doesn’t work in
  <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/">
   Opera Mini
  </a>
  . It’s true, because Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads which you can easily check by visiting two
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/inputfile/index.html">
   demo pages
  </a>
  with valid XHTML. You shouldn’t see a file input element on either of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe (but as an outsider obviously can’t prove) it lacks upload support for security reasons. Every web request handled by Opera Mini gets transported over a proxy, which fetches the page in questions and translates it in a compressed format suitable for viewing on small screen devices. This means that file uploads would be sent to proxy as well which depending on what is sent can be seen as a security violation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course it does allow logging in websites, a potentially unsafe action, which puts my speculation on shaky grounds. But the true point of this article still stands. Opera Mini doesn’t support file uploads.

  1st of May is coming closer, when hundreds if not thousands of web designers will change the look of their blogs in by now traditional
  <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">
   CSS Reboot
  </a>
  day. I find the idea at least odd, if not exactly wrong, so this blog won’t be one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As can be clearly seen, I’m not a graphic designer. Even though I’m certain my current design is better than previous was, it’s not exactly good either. There’s also a wide consensus that I look best when my wife picks the clothes so clearly my eagerness is not matched with ability. Then again, it’s not my intention to discuss a particular design as much as graphic design use and its role in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  What bothers me in CSS Reboot is the implicit idea that graphic design is just a facade, a fashionable wrapping of content that can be easily discarded and replaced with something else on a specific date in year. It bothers me that this idea is made explicit in the way every blogging software I used works, by slapping chosen graphical theme on every page of content, even those created long before this theme came in existence. This might be beneficial for a company website, where design is mainly exploited to further branding, but do most blogs really fit the same mold?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m sure there are cases, where graphic design is a thing of fashion or where it’s the story itself. But more often than not it’s something that not only presents the content in usable manner, it communicates what it is and helps to frame it in space and time. Ideally it would change only when direction, vision of site changes and only where it actually does so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t write in a vacuum and not much if anything I wrote is of lasting value. I wish I was like
  <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">
   Jon Udell
  </a>
  and my writings would still be relevant years after they were published, but I’m not.  What I write is neither timeless nor does it constitute one coherent whole and it’s vexing that design by its singularity implies that.
 </p>
 <p>
  In truth, the problem is not so much with Reboot, which even though they should know better only implies values I don’t share, but certainly doesn’t enforce them on participants. The problem really lies in modern widely used content management systems which as all software embodies values and prejudices of their creators and their accomplices, too often rather ignorant users .
