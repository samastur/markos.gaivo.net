  Ever since I listened to Andy Clarke’s talk at @media, I’ve been convinced that what we’re missing is a simple way to distinguish between visitors which need accessible version of the site and those who would prefer to use a non-accessible version.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still think that by and large sites should be made accessible to everyone and done so completely. But just as Braille signs are used only by those who need them, there’s no reason why everyone should be using the same user interface when not doing so can be beneficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who’ve been dabbling with Javascript and AJAX for a while have probably noticed that it can be very difficult if often not impossible to make every piece of interface accessible. A common approach was to add javascript as a layer on top of an accessible website, which could be turned off when necessary. I find this a rather blunt instrument, since all or nothing approach removes even pieces that may be useful and accessible. Yet, there didn’t seem to be a better way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accessibility preference would ideally be provided by a browser in a way that can be picked up with Javascript (environment variable?), but lacking that, I was looking for a way to signal such preference through user defined CSS. My idea was to define a syntactically valid, but normally not used combination of a page element, CSS property and its value that could be interpreted as a switch for accessible version of the site.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, now
  <a href="http://osflash.org/flashaid">
   there’s
  </a>
  another way to learn if screen reader is used (
  <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/77#comment-container">
   via
  </a>
  Jeremy Keith), which uses Flash 8 and its JS-Flash bridge to read if such a device is present. Obviously its use is not universal, but it covers scenario that troubles me most.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still a real fix would be a better support from user agents. It doesn’t seem to be that hard to add an environment variable and a preference switch, so is there some other reason why it hasn’t happened yet?

  There’s a vast number of potential Marela features that we are able, but not willing to implement, since they are detrimental to our design goals. There are also many, which we are willing and will implement, but it doesn’t change the fact that there will always be parts where we won’t compromise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, even though it seems natural that benefits to many should be more important than benefits to few, I never got quite comfortable with this. That’s why we also want to make Marela as open as possible to let our members customize it without affecting other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, there are public APIs. They tend to work well for building new tools or interfaces, but offer little help in customizing existing ones. Which is what our users want most of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every modern browser lets users define a custom style sheet to change the presentation of websites. That’s why we recently added ID to body element, which lets users more
  <a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/13291">
   easily customize
  </a>
  the look of Marela alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there are tools like
  <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">
   Greasemonkey
  </a>
  , which let proficient users using Mozilla based browsers customizing existing interfaces. Greasemonkey works quite well, if you’re proficient in Javascript.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think the biggest problem with Greasemonkey (and custom CSS for that matter) is that it’s tied to a browser and a computer. If you change either of them, your customization won’t work anymore without significant effort on your part. Sometimes, in restricted environments, it’s not even possible to make it work. It’s a bit easier to make and transfer CSS customizations, but you’re still forced to carry your file around.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not too bothered with CSS. I simply don’t see much need for it beyond what Marela’s design and modern browsers already offer and I’m still biased against skin-deep themes offered by some programs. In any case a possible solution for it would be practically the same as what I have in mind for a case that does trouble me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Idea is pretty simple. Define javascript hooks that get called after window.onload event when they exist. If there’s an easy way to add your javascript file to a page (say, by uploading it to our server), then you can create a simple, but cross-browser and cross-computer Greasemonkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Question that remains is, is this appealing enough for you to use it?

 <p>
  This week I had an interesting discussion with Ratnadeep Bhattacharjee about my
  <a href="news-at-seven-javascript-i18n-that-almost-doesnt-suck.html" title="Older post with js i18n library">
   previous try
  </a>
  to solve javascript i18n needs and it quickly become obvious that my library is not sufficient and likely also wrong approach to the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are at least two unresolved issues with my current javascript i18n library:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It doesn’t detect browser language settings and act accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
   It’s one way only. After you changed the language used, you can’t change it again easily.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  I’m sure these are not the only two problems, since I have a vague uneasiness about a few more things. Therefore I’d love to hear more thoughts about what you’d expect and need from such a library, before I continue down the possibly wrong path.
