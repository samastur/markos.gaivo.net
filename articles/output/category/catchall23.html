    was quite good.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s no shocking revelation that I’m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I’d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I’ve used for more than three decades.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I’m sure I still make mistakes like this.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there’s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you’re talking about and not well enough to actually do.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?

    I’ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I’ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it’s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.
   </p>
   <p>
    Customer relationship management.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you’re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I’m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There’s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn’t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it’s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why is this so hard for others to learn?
   </p>
   <p>
    By the way, if you need to buy computer hardware and you want to get a good price with as little fuss as possible, please let me know and I’ll send you his email address.

    We’ve been working with a talented group of designers, whose work I admired for a long time, on a design for our new service. Initial concept was exactly what we were looking for and the only changes that needed to be made, were consequences of our bad choices earlier on. In fact, everything was great except one thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    We didn’t like proposed color schemes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every time I work with a designer, I’m afraid I’ll have to say that. It’s probably the most common complaint they hear and I really hate to join this particular crowd. Sure, they’ve always been graceful (at least the good designers), but I’m certain they wouldn’t mind spiking a voodoo doll of me, given a chance.
   </p>
   <p>
    That got me thinking, is there a specific, but very common complaint for every trade out there? I couldn’t recall one for programmers, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. I certainly would love to hear your experiences.
