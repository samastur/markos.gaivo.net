  Only brains twisted in a pretzel can be completely fine with sweeping lightly-overseen secret surveillance of society, but feel personal freedoms are tyrannically trampled when soda cups are limited to sizes smaller than a bucket or when city bikes are introduced.

  Whoever thinks losing privacy is fine because he has nothing to hide, is either seriously lacking imagination, an idiot or both.

  As a person with a somewhat unusual fondness for measuring and modelling my own behavior I should be a happy buyer of
  <a href="https://jawbone.com/up" title="Jawbone's UP">
   gadgets
  </a>
  for
  <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one" title="Fitbit">
   collecting data
  </a>
  about myself and my environment. Yet so far I bought none, because they don’t seem to work
  <em>
   well
  </em>
  without (occasional) data sync with producer’s servers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I really shouldn’t have to explain privacy standpoint of this. Describing my life and immediate environment in detail to a bunch of people I have never met, some of whom don’t even work for the company yet and trusting all of them that they will not compromise it for as long as they will keep it is to me self-evidently moronic.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I also avoid such hardware even when data in question might not be particularly sensitive. If I am paying for something to be manufactured, then I expect to own it. If a gadget depends on an external service to be useful, then I am really only leasing it. Services disappear for many reasons and it doesn’t make much sense to rely on their availability unless you can host them yourself. I loath ads, but paying for a service is not a guarantee for its continuing presence either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not against functionality that reasonably requires at least occasional connection to grid. Most social features probably do. Products like phones don’t even make sense without network. Web interfaces certainly do make these devices cheaper and more quickly evolving. So there are certainly good reasons beyond roping you in to make them partially off-loaded on web.
 </p>
 <p>
  However I don’t want to use those features and I certainly don’t want to give up data I care about for features I don’t. What I expect from devices I buy is my control of data and purchased functionality without others meddling or peeking over my shoulders.

  <strong>
   Warning:
  </strong>
  this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started using
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Description of IRC">
   IRC
  </a>
  almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">
   Tumblr
  </a>
  and a
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" title="Definition of neologism">
   neologism
  </a>
  that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I never heard of something like that related to
  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">
   WordPress
  </a>
  although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.
 </p>
 <p>
  However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29" title="Ulysses - an example of such work">
   Joyce-like stream of consciousness
  </a>
  . I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.
