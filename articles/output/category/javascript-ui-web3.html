   Nice idea
  </a>
  , but very poor execution.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update:
  </strong>
  It seems access to Google Page Creator is limited, so it would make sense if I spend some time explaining what I meant. What Google Page Creator (GPC) allows you to do, is to build a simple website using your browser. It differentiates itself from majority of such tools (but not all of them) in that it allows you to do this through a WYSIWYG interface, where you can easily see exactly how your page will look like when you’re finished with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are things I like. Page creator is easy to use and you get a direct feedback on everything you do. Sadly, the overall impression is less positive, since there’s plenty I dislike:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   GPC is incredibly slow. True, G4 Powerbook is not a top of the line anymore, but there are tons of web applications with similar capabilities (some of them mine) which don’t drag their feet so much.
  </li>
  <li>
   As others have noted, HTML produced is simply crap. Font tags should be extinct by now and there’s really no excuse to produce them in 2006. You can get a glimpse of the horror by looking at the source of my page (linked at the end of this post).
  </li>
  <li>
   There are plenty of designs, but they mostly differ in color schemes used. It’s hard to find one that isn’t simply dull.
  </li>
  <li>
   GPC is simplified almost to the point of uselessness. You can stitch static pages together and build a simple static website, but there’s not much else you can do. I expected more. Something, anything that would make you believe the final result was done in the age of blogs, wikis and mash-ups and not 5-6 years ago.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In short, it’s hardly an improvement over what was already available out there. You can see
  <a href="http://markos.googlepages.com/">
   result

  of my experiment and I posted

  Holidays are closer with each day and it’s getting harder and harder to concentrate on work, when your mind is occupied with loot coming your way.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s also a time of the year when web sites are filled with various summations of year left behind and always present guesses about the future. I certainly am not above that and I’ll probably add a line or two of my own in next few days, but I also wanted to finish my little javascript i18n library before the year ends. I don’t want it to turn into a pumpkin at midnight like some girl’s ride back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  You know, sort of a present for everyone as it befits this holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alas, it’s taking longer then planned. So many things to do and so little time. Since trip to Stockholm is just around the corner, I decided to release what I believe by now to be practically usable piece of localization code. If you’re interested just in the goods, then you can see new javascript file
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/3/translate.js" title="Javascript i18n library">
   here
  </a>
  and demo
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/js_i18n/3/index.html" title="Javascript i18n demo">
   here
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  There have been few changes since
  <a href="look-ma-html-too.html" title="Previous post on this topic">
   last time
  </a>
  . The whole thing has been objectified, but I kept  few functions (
  <em>
   stripStr
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   stripStrML
  </em>
  and new one
  <em>
   printf
  </em>
  ) outside of a class, since they’re too general to belong there. Nice thing about new class is that instead of looking for globally defined translation dictionary, it’s initialized with one. This also means you can use more than one translation object or translation dictionary per page, which sounds cool even if not all that useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made a small correction to method
  <em>
   toEntity
  </em>
  . A bug was pointed out to me by
  <a href="http://www.opera.com">
   Opera browser
  </a>
  , which is a great browser for testing against standards, if not common sense. I might think it’s OK to fetch a character out of a string with their index value, as you would fetch an element from a list or an object, but I would be wrong. That’s why a string method
  <em>
   charAt
  </em>
  was defined and if working everywhere except in Opera is not good enough for you, then you must use this method. So, I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also renamed the function
  <em>
   _
  </em>
  . It’s a nifty name widely used in other languages, but it doesn’t work quite like that when it’s a method in an object.
  <em>
   init.js
  </em>
  demonstrates how you can still use it by defining an anonymous function.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is it for now. I think the library is actually usable, but it’s also lacking few things.
  <em>
   printf
  </em>
  provides now a method of easily stitching  stings together and even using parameters in translations. However, it does require that those parameters are listed in same order as in original text. Better than previously, but still often awkward.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s missing is also a tool to translate between javascript dictionary/object and a widely used translation format like
  <em>
   GNU’s gettext
  </em>
  . I’m currently working on this and I hope to have something usable ready in next few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last but not least, it needs a useful documentation on how to use it and work with it. It will get it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Update: It turns out my code might be usable, but it’s certainly not good. Some issues were listed in
  </em>
  <em>
   <a href="revisiting-javascript-i18n.html">
    later
   </a>
  </em>
  <em>
   post and some I discovered just recently. For instance it won’t work if you’re trying to translate text on buttons or if text to be translated includes HTML tags (case of tags is not preserved in DOM tree, which wouldn’t be a problem if Firefox and IE defaulted to the same one).

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <div>
 <p>
  Yesterday I wrote about my wish of making background
  <em>
   POST
  </em>
  requests that don’t get accidentally canceled. I wasn’t specific enough. You can create background
  <em>
   POST
  </em>
  requests just fine with
  <em>
   XMLHttpRequest
  </em>
  , but you can’t use such requests for file uploads, which is what I want.
 </p>
 <p>
  My first try was to post
  <em>
   form
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   iframe
  </em>
  in a different window. This didn’t work because browsers pay attention to source of request. Activating new request in source window immediately cancels previous unfinished one.
 </p>
 <p>
  A better idea was provided by always helpful
  <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" title="Dojo toolkit">
   dojo
  </a>
  developers. Clone
  <em>
   form
  </em>
  to progress window and submit it from there. This one works great in Firefox, but hardly anywhere else. It certainly doesn’t work in IE, since IE is very picky about what you do with nodes created with
  <em>
   cloneNode
  </em>
  and you can’t clone form yourself, since it’s not possible to set the value of file upload elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this game over for unobtrusive file upload?
 </p>
 <p>
  Not yet. There are still at least two posibilities, both with downsides, but one of them definitely works. You can open file upload form in new window and change that window to progress bar. It works and I use it occasionally, but it’s not nice if you care about accessibility. It’s something users can do now, if they want, by opening upload page in new tab or window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other, yet untried, possible solution would be to avoid cloning. Just rip the form out from original page, move it to status one and submit form there. Obvious problems with this one are that users lose information about what they’re uploading and that it can look confusing if not executed well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll try it anyway and will let you know how it goes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Update: IE also dislikes ripping and moving.
