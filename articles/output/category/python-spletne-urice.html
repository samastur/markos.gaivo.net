   Put up with any significant-whitespace whining. Here 99% of the Python community is with me. I think there is a meme that Python people are close-minded to suggestions for changes in the language. I think there is significant truth to that. But sometimes everyone else is just completely wrong. I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent their code. If you want to mis-indent your code you are an idiot. If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being absurd.

  Precisely. Yesterday was our regular
  <a href="http://web.zen.si/">
   web talk evening
  </a>
  , which is often followed by a lively debate. As usual we covered all sorts of topics, one of which was Python. To paraphrase a part of it:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A: I don’t like Python because of significant whitespace.
   <br/>
   B: Do you indent your code?
   <br/>
   A: Yes, of course.
   <br/>
   B: And the problem is?
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  I can’t understand how this complaint doesn’t die. I can understand that some other language can tickle their fancy. People have different tastes and if some people like it rough, who am I to judge. But why in the world would you wish for a feature you’d never be stupid enough to use?

  I’m online again and have been reading news of the last few days.  So I’m kind of late to
  <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/friendship-and-hand-holding.html">
   discussion
  </a>
  about friendliness of communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  My personal experience with Python community has been absolutely wonderful. I’ve written
  <a href="no-language-feature-is-optional.html">
   posts
  </a>
  that could be seen as inflammatory, but the response I’ve got was just amazing. I haven’t been nailed to the cross for it and have learned a lot from people I admire, who took the time to leave a comment on my blog for which I’m really grateful. A couple of days ago I
  <a href="searching-for-atom-feed-generator.html">
   needed help
  </a>
  developing atom feeds and got it immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  I find Python community very friendly and forthcoming, but I also believe Ian is right that Ruby might feel more friendly simply because a kind of youthful innocence. I wouldn’t really know, since I don’t use the language or follow up their discussions. I have however experienced in other communities the problem of a disconnect between old timers and newer members, who don’t share cultural history just yet. I think this is inevitable, since experience unlike knowledge can’t be easily given.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, I have a different problem with web related talks we’re organizing. It’s been our goal from the start to use talks as a conduit for slovenian web community building, which hasn’t happened to the extent I was hoping for. Our talks are well attended, but at the end our audience mostly leaves, which kind of saddens me. I’d like to get them more engaged, but I have no idea if the problem lies with us, organizers, or is just a result of slovenian culture.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess community building is just hard.
