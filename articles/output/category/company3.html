  of mine is having a lousy year. He broke a leg, but further complications have brought him back to the hospital. I wanted to lend him some DVD’s to shorten those long hours in bed, yet who has the time to transcribe all those titles?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if you’re a Mac user, then there’s a program called
  <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">
   Delicious Library
  </a>
  which lets you (among other things) input those DVD’s by simply scanning the barcode with a camera. I have to say that calling that program awesome is an understatement. I simply can’t think of a better designed piece of software. It is as if every piece of the program, every line of code or UI ornament was specifically minted for your satisfaction. True craftsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I once heard that persian rugs were always created with one deliberate mistake, since only god was allowed true perfection. Well, there’s a mistake like that in Delicious Library. I tried to buy it for more than an hour, probably more like two, and it simply wouldn’t budge. You can’t buy it through a browser. You have to use its own interface which in my case simply refused to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally I gave up and wrote a message about my tribulations that in hindsight could be more friendly. I’ve soon received a friendly message from Mike together with an evaluation license, which allowed me to produce the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  I often complain about the way companies treat their customers and it’s really a pleasure to write about an experience like this. Not only do they produce a remarkable product, they also go all the way when it comes to helping their customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I only have to find a way to actually pay for it, since the product and people behind it more than deserve it.

  If you own a company, you’re bound to be buried under an avalanche of various offers. I got one from HP today, trying to sell me a color laser printer with the following foldout (click for a bigger picture):
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.marela.si/photos/7039/?original" title="Full size picture">
   <img alt="Print error on HP's foldout" src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/Dhkv4lp6mpC2gzRgcAzdfaaFSnc.jpg"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mistakes happen and printing ones are no exception. But sending such foldout to prospective buyers of printers?
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that’s simply stupid.

  I normally don’t care much about games and write about them even less. But I get really annoyed when I see the same idiotic argument repeated again and again. As Eurogamer via TheRegister

   SCE UK Managing Director Rat Maguire said: “I don’t think it’s an expensive machine – I think actually, it’s probably a cheap machine. If you think a Blu-Ray player by itself might be £600-700, and we’re coming in at just £425, it’s a bargain.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Cheaper than (outrageously) expensive is not necessarily cheap, it might be just less expensive. Personally, if people were screaming at me that 425 quid is too much as much as they do at Sony lately, I’d rather worry if 600 pounds price will simply be a disaster.
