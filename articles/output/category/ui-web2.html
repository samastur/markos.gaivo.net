  I’m not sure how I missed the original announcement of Simple List Extensions (SLE) for feeds, but better late than never.
 </p>
 <p>
  SLE is a very simple specification to extend feeds syntax to better support some common scenarios that weren’t covered with original specifications of RSS and Atom. Previously there was no way to tell feed readers/aggregators to display feed items in fixed order (e.g. feed with most popular stories of the day) or delete items not present in feed anymore (e.g. auction site feed with items matching a query).
 </p>
 <p>
  SLE also adds support for grouping and filtering of feed items, which might not be very useful with you average 10-item feed, but will be, if feeds will indeed become a general mechanism for transporting data and not only a tool to highlight most recent bunch of updates. In any case, you can read a very short
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sle/">
   specification
  </a>
  or visit
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/30/565222.aspx">
   latest announcement
  </a>
  which includes more explanatory links to why and how they can and already are used.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the way, I’m not sure if any reader apart from beta of IE7 already supports SLE, but I expect that most of them will soon. There’s little reason not to.

 <p>
  There’s an issue I’ve been struggling with for months now. Well, more than a year really. We built Marela so it would be used in Slovenia by people preferring Slovene language over the others. It’s not the only distinguishing point from similar services found on the web, but it’s an important one.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Internet and low fares airlines certainly shrank our planet and it’s not uncommon for many of us to have friends who don’t speak our language but with whom we’d still like to share parts of our lives and our creations. And this is a problem for Marela, which was (also) built to fill this need of sharing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s simply not possible to use Marela in any language but Slovene.
 </p>
 <p>
  We decided to do this to avoid Orkut syndrome, where brazilian users (legitimately) subverted  a global service into a mostly Portuguese speaking one. We didn’t want to risk making our site unfriendly to Slovene-only speaking members by creating an environment in which a large portion of our community neither could or would speak Slovene.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe our interfaces are mostly self-explanatory and easy to use, but it’s difficult to tell how challenging they are for those who don’t speak their language. Judging by personal experience in using a dutch Windows 95 years ago, I’d say they are probably not easy enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, what can be done?
 </p>
 <p>
  There was an idea to enforce Slovene only for logged in users, but this can work only as long as unregistered users are not allowed to contribute and the idea itself doesn’t feel natural to me. It seems such an artificial restriction and that never amounts to a good thing. And that was one of more promising ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran out of my own ideas long time ago. Any ideas you might have are therefore more than welcome.

            <div class="entry-content post-text">

 <p>
  The pixel debate
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200602/setting_font_size_in_pixels/" title="Setting font size in pixels">
   is back
  </a>
  . Internet explorer out of the box doesn’t permit resizing text measured in pixels, which at the same time is the only reliable way of setting dimensions that produces same result everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crux of the matter is simply who should have the final word in how the page is displayed, designers or users?
 </p>
 <p>
  Personally I think it should be users. After all, it’s about them and if there’s a way for them to make their experience more pleasant or useful without degrading it for others, why shouldn’t they be allowed to do so? Good designs serve, not command.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I find it more interesting how many people have no idea what px unit actually
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units" title="Definitions of relative length units">
   means
  </a>
  . Pixels, as defined by W3C, are not the same as pixels used to define graphic resolution of a computer, even if they usually seem to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if we ever happen to get high-density monitors with say 300 dpi pixel density instead of these days common 96 dpi, then a 15″ display would have a graphic resolution of 3600×2700 dots, but it would still have only 1152×864 pixels in CSS model. Therefore one web pixel would be represented with around 9 graphic pixels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, that’s the theory. In practice there’s a lot of cheating. Monitors have various sizes which are only an approximation of the stated one (15″, 17″ etc.). Operating systems try to pay attention to pixel density, but often don’t or can’t. And so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result of this is that size of displayed text and images is device dependent even when in theory it shouldn’t be. So the only way is also good only up to a point.
