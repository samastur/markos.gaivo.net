            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I started few books in 2020 and finished even fewer. I read obsessively, but once 2020 happened it was dominated by COVID-19 related research and information. Somewhere in late February or early March I also made a conscious decision to effectively ignore books this year and focus my attention on activities with less individual positive mental health effects.</p>
<p>None of the books I did manage to read is bad so they all point to Amazon’s smile (well, except the content strategy one). As charity benefits are minuscule I should find a good source not owned by Amazon. Hopefully next year. I recommend those in bold and especially Muriel Spark’s.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Ayoade-Top-Richard/dp/0571339131/">Ayoade On Top</a> by Richard Ayoade. A book about a movie only Ayoade, me and a handful other people saw. An argument for movie's greatness that is a fun reading for fans of Ayoade and his humour and probably not much fun for others. I enjoyed it greatly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Girls-Slender-Means-Directions-Classic/dp/081121379X/">The Girls of Slender Means</a> by Muriel Spark</strong>. I was drawn to this book by its title and sold on it by its brilliant first page. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am by this relatively short, but immensely rich book exemplified by its comic and with multiple meanings layered title.</li>
<li><a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy">The Elements of Content Strategy</a> by Erin Kissane. I read this book first in 2011 and it is still a good overview/reference on this topic. However I was clearly wrong about not having this problem ever.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Natives-Class-Empire-Sunday-Bestseller/dp/1473661234/">Natives</a> by Akala</strong>. An eye-opening part autobiography, part polemic on racism experienced as a not-white person growing up and living in contemporary UK. A difficult but necessary read even for those of us who are neither British nor living in UK. I don't share authors view on everything (Castro, China...), but would nevertheless recommend this book to anyone who cares about (racial) justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure I never read fewer books in a year since I learned how to read. 2021 is not shaping up to be a great year either, so my plans will remain modest. Hopefully at least high single digits and evenly split between work and pleasure.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../2019-review.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to 2019 review">2019 review</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Even with the best intentions I keep writing these reviews fairly late into the new year. I started this one on the same day in January that I published <a href="../2018-review.html">the last one</a> and here we are in February. Plan for the next one: do it at the end of 2020 or when 2021 is still young enough to be ignored.</p>
<p>“History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.”</p>
<p>In many ways 2019 felt like a remake of 2018. By any objective measure, as a whole, it was not a good year and 2020 already has in store for us something I don’t look forward to.</p>
<p>Which does not mean that last year was a never-ending stream of misery. We’ve been to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/albums/72157710919477443">Iceland</a> in summer and went on a bunch of short trips over the year, each of which was fun with a minor exception of a scuffle with a French border guard in Paris. We hiked a lot and I spent on average more than an hour a day being physically active. If only I also ate healthier.</p>
<p>Speaking of food, at some point things got out of hand and I now posses almost a double digit number of various powders for chocolate beverages with a creeping number of chocolate/nuts spreads. Maybe the solution is just to put an acceptable label on this, harmless when tempered, development. A collector? A connoisseur? Cocoa aficionado? Can’t say I like any of them.</p>
<p>I ended last year feeling rather fine, largely thanks to my new job and colleagues at <a href="https://uptree.co/">Uptree</a>. I haven’t felt so much enthusiasm for my work in years.</p>
<p>I built nothing last year and don’t <em>expect</em> to this year either, at least outside of work, but hope springs eternal. However, it was the first year in a while in which I felt growing. Obviously not physically, although my feet may differ. I attribute this impression to the selection of books I read, life giving me more to chew on and not being too busy for a good part of the year.</p>
<p>Growth could have been a mirage, but I’ve been pondering a lot and it became really clear that a lot of my thinking last few years was me circling around 3 questions: What do I want to do? What do I want to achieve? And who do I want to be?</p>
<p>Looking back at yearly reviews it is obvious that it was really the tension between the last two that needed resolving. Each of these questions in itself is neutral, but my perception of them isn’t. There’s an introspective quality and aim to “who to be” that I find lacking in “what to achieve”.</p>
<p>And I find it difficult to write about how these two questions relate to me without sounding like a pompous wanker, but what I would say, if I had another month (a month!), distilled, is that “who I am” has meaningful answers only when it describes relationships and those, human or otherwise, are feeling more precious and impermanent.</p>
<p>“What to do,” is neither an independent actor nor a servile servant to the other two questions. Once goals are chosen, paths to them may be different, but direction isn’t. Doing still requires making choices and last year certainly showed that I suck at choosing when I give too much weight to money. This is a privilege.</p>
<p>I did not write much here last year, but more than I did before. It would be nice if I would write more, but my real goal is to keep gloominess limited to these yearly reviews. I don’t feel as despondent as my description sounds. If I have to pick what’s true, I’ll go with bad writing over denial.</p>
<p>So, to make this long post at least a bit shorter, my plans for 2020… support loved ones, do good work, stay active, see world, eat healthy, keep reading, write more, keep learning, surprise myself and ease off sweets.</p>
<p>Now, this seems like a good time to have a nice cup of hot chocolate…</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>The last catalog post in the series of what occupied me last year, but this one has a lineage. I’ve been writing about the books I read annualy since 2009. I was young back then.</p>
<p>Links still lead to Smile Amazon. Those without them are not terrible (like previous years), just without an entry there and I was too lazy and tired from hiking to find a different link. Book titles are in the languages in which I read them. I recommend those in bold. Those wanting to improve their focus may want to check <em>Deep Work</em>.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/">Securing Angular Applications</a> by Ryan Chenkie. While it covers all important bits it is too full of unrelated fluff and could be edited to a quarter of its length. Best for those new to Angular and web development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Evolution-Intelligent/dp/0008226296/">Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith.</strong> I love this book, but not everyone does. A fascinating look at development of intelligence and cephalopods for those interested in both and I was not bothered too much that author occasionally wanders a bit.</li>
<li>Security and Frontend Performance: Breaking the Conundrum by Sonia Burney &amp; Sabrina Burney. A short focused book on improving website's security and performance mainly through better use of HTTP, improving delivery of 3rd party content and use of service workers. A bit aged after 2 years, but still provides a good overview for those using 3rd party resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Chess-Story-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171691/">Chess</a> by Stefan Zweig. A novella about chess, human need for stimulus and psychological torture.</li>
<li>Schachnovelle by Stefan Zweig. Same as previous one, except without minor translation errors. Figured out I could read it in original German and liked it enough to do so.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Arab-Future-Childhood-1985-1987-Graphic/dp/1473638283/">The Arab of the Future 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987</a> by Riad Sattouf. Third part of trilogy that will have at least 4 parts. Highly recommended for those who liked first two.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/My-Sister-Serial-Killer-Novel/dp/0385544235">My Sister, the Serial Killer</a> by Oyinkan Braithwaite. A crime novel by a Nigerian author about two sisters, one of which with a penchant for dead now ex-boyfriends. Not my usual fare, but I enjoyed this quick-to-read book a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng/dp/0735224293">Little Fires Everywhere</a> by Celeste Ng. Recommended by Tomaž. I was not bothered by it being somewhat predictable, as I don't think author generally tried to or needed to surprise reader, but I think the book would be better if author didn't use future to somewhat sentimentally resolve some narrative threads. Otherwise well written engrossing story with rare off note and I really enjoy reading it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Train-Time-Essential-Heinrich-Boll/dp/1935554328/">The Train Was on Time</a> by Heinrich Böll.</strong> A German soldier boarding a train to the front in Poland has a premonition of his impending death (train ride not incidentally following route of millions of European Jews). A meditative mostly first-person account on war, life, loss and historical disgrace. The kind of book that changes you.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a> by Cal Newport. I'm ambivalent about this book since I am definitely in its target market, think it has some solid advice and writing itself isn't bad. However, I also mind that much of it is poorly sourced or supported, some clearly coloured by author's prejudices (matching mine) and all of it too closely shaped as self-help genre these days demands.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Springtime-Broken-Mirror-Mario-Benedetti/dp/1620974908/">Springtime in a Broken Mirror</a> by Mario Benedetti.</strong> A book about a political prisoner in Uruguay and his family in exile written by Benedetti when he was, too, in exile. Wise, witty, moving, profound book is certainly one of the best I read in the last decade and deserves to be read slowly and more than once.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Beautiful-Summer-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241983398/">The Beautiful Summer</a> by Cesare Pavese. A short novel about a girl’s loss of innocence in 1930’s Turin. Another take on a familiar story which is neither good enough to recommend nor mediocre enough to complain. Translations occasionally felt dated and to me difficult to understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Functional-Steps-Transforming-Programmer-dp-1449368174/dp/1449368174/">Becoming Functional</a> by Joshua Backfield. “...in Java move to Scala.” OK, but with annoying boss examples and cumbersome language pick.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Failure-Memoir-Gary-Shteyngart/dp/0812982495/">The Little Failure</a> by Gary Steyngart. Generally not a fan of autobiographies, but I read this one because I like his writing and do not regret it. It is not only a seemingly very honest assessment of his life, family and relationships so far, but it also provides an interesting view in being Russian Jewish immigrant in USA.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Functional-Thinking-Paradigm-Over-Syntax-dp-1449365515/dp/1449365515/">Functional Thinking</a> by Neal Ford. Similar to Becoming Functional with more emphasis on how to think “functionally” then what functional programming is. Also very focused on Java developers and diluted by involving too many alternatives and not enough focus. Still, better than Becoming Functional.</li>
<li>Functional Programming in Python by David Mertz. A short introduction to functional programming with Python3. Liked it better than the other 2 as it felt more on point. Again wished it touched also on architecture parts of development.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Node-Front-End-Developers-Server-Side-Applications-ebook/dp/B0073U0XFM/">Node for Front-End Developers</a> by Garann Means. Read to kill time on a flight since it is already very old (2012). Basic enough for examples to mostly still work, but not sure who the audience is. Useful information could be condensed to quarter of its already meagre size.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Burial-Rites-Hannah-Kent/dp/0316243922/">Burial Rites</a> by Hannah Kent. A dramatised story about last woman to be executed in Iceland, picked while we were there. I got progressively more interested and by the end could hardly put down this well written story.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Levels-Julian-Barnes-3-Apr-2014-Paperback/dp/B011T7HJZQ/">Levels of Life</a> by Julian Barnes.</strong> A book about finding and losing love, especially tragically by the author. Or as Independent put it better: "Anyone who has loved and lost can't fail to be moved by this devastating book."</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008211213">Running Blind</a> by Desmond Bagley. I rarely read crime novels, but I enjoyed this one visiting so many Icelandic tourist spots. Written well enough and certainly surprising enough to keep my attention until its end.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cat-Man-Two-Women-ebook/dp/B075V3VP46/">A Cat, a Man, and Two Women</a> by Junichiro Tanizaki. A novella about a love triangle with a true feline rival. Enjoyable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Little-Penguin-European-Writers/dp/0241357454/">The Lady and the Little Fox Fur</a> by Violette Leduc.</strong> Almost poetic and most truthful description of poverty and loneliness which demands to be read slowly as every sentence is rich with meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect 2020 to be busy so I’ll be happy if I manage to read as much as passed year. I hope to keep my fiction and non-fiction selection varied and keep trying to avoid Anglo-Saxon authors.</p>
<p>This year I enjoyed almost everything I read purely for my own pleasure and <a href="../on-technical-writing.html">almost nothing</a> I read for work. My work-related reading will likely be directed by work circumstances and hopefully less frustrating.</p>
