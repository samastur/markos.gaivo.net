            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../dvd-backups.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to DVD backups">DVD backups</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Yesterday I finished backing up about 200 DVD disks to a drive, most of which are about 10 years old. Took me about 10 days and 1.5TB of space. I just copied data as it was the quickest and doesn't lose any information. Drive may complain and require change of a DVD region, but once they are copied, computer doesn't care anymore. Glad this part is over now.</p>
<p>Some of them needed cleaning, but I really had problems only with three, two of which remains not copied. As it happens it is also one of those on which I can find no visible scratch whatsoever. It used to work, because I've seen it. It does make you wonder what life span of disks really is, even when they were professionally produced. If you have any, I heartily recommend making a backup of them on some other medium. Unless of course they themselves are a secondary backup.</p>
<p>Flipping disks regularly for 10 days does make you notice their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case">cases</a>, especially hubs that keep disks in place with varying degrees of zeal. It is astonishing how many designs have been used over years and how few of them are actually pleasant to use.</p>
<p>Crown of teeth is probably the worst. Like a pitbull unwilling to release a disk until it is visibly bended or a tooth broken. Unless case is made of hard plastic there is really no excuse for using this design. Or any other "pluck" hubs.</p>
<p>Thank god there are patents (as there always are) to prevent everyone converging to those few "push-to-release" that are actually nice to use. How could I after all value my life appropriately without it being spiced with needless hassle.</p>
<p>At some point I intend to process them into a different, smaller formats that require less space and are easier to (re)use. I am not in a hurry as this step still seems laborious and may also result in some content being lost. I am also thinking of making an additional copy together with file hashes so I could, in principle, recover if any of files gets corrupted.</p>
<p>Next: processing our CD collection.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../long-vacations.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Long vacations">Long vacations</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.</p>
<p>Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.</p>
<p>It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.</p>
<p>Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.</p>
<p>You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="../windows.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Windows">Windows</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I got a new <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/">travel computer</a> this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.</p>
<p>It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until <strong>everyone</strong> can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.</p>
<p>I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.</p>
<p>I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually <em>the best Windows</em> so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.</p>
