    Tags are increasingly popular and rightfully so. I’ve built my share of applications with their own taxonomies and I’m certain they simply don’t work. They sort of work if they were built for specialized needs and are used only by trained, disciplined people with excellent organizational skills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Which means almost never.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tags (aka folksonomies) are messy. There’s no real system, any bozo can attach whatever it wants and you’d be a fool to blindly trust any specific tag. They are the worst possible system apart from everything else we tried so far.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s why we decided to implement them in Marela. Language used on Marela is Slovene and that led to slightly different design that commonly found elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    We decided to treat multiple words separated with spaces as one tag and use commas as a delimiters between different tags. First reason for this is that tagging something like
    <em>
     New Zealand
    </em>
    becomes more natural. The other was that in Slovene compound words like handbag are very often separate words. For example, handbag would be
    <em>
     ro??na torbica
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Another problem, which we haven’t tackled yet, but probably will have to, is that Slovene is
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_grammar" title="Short description on Wikipedia">
     a complicated language
    </a>
    in ways that make tagging a nasty problem. There are six cases, but nominative is usually used. Still three different grammatical numbers (singular, dual and plural) together with three different genders (masculine, feminine and neutral) leave multiple options for the same thing. If you were looking for
    <em>
     blue
    </em>
    objects, you’d need to search at least for tags
    <em>
     modra
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
     modro
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
     modri
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     modre
    </em>
    . Right now you have to do this manually.
   </p>
   <p>
    And then there are problems that plaque other tagging systems as well. Most common of them are misspelled words, like
    <em>
     Wein
    </em>
    instead of
    <em>
     Wien
    </em>
    for Vienna.
   </p>
   <p>
    All these lead to a fairly flat tag space with a ratio of 5.6 between all tags and unique ones. I’m not sure how it would change if we treated spaces differently or even what is a common ratio for other languages and other applications. I’m guessing it wouldn’t change the ratio too much because of noun cases, but it remains to be investigated.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, why does it matter?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, that’s a matter for another post, which I’ll probably write tomorrow.

    As noted in my previous post, we changed the way image navigation works on Marela. I already described “philosophical” reason for previous behavior and in this post I intend to visit other reasons and lessons learned.
   </p>
   <p>
    I liked the old behavior because it made every page recognizable and there were no side effects, no special cases that would require different handling and make interface bigger. It made under-developed mathematician in me feel all fuzzy and warm.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I mean by recognizable is that you could quickly tell where on Marela you are just by looking at the displayed page. Hence it should be easy to know how to proceed and what you can do. Very predictable.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except it didn’t matter and nobody cared.
   </p>
   <p>
    New behavior brought special cases and I’m quite certain we haven’t met all of them yet. Example of one would be navigating through set of images grouped by a tag and deleting that tag from the current image. Where does that put you?
   </p>
   <p>
    The picture obviously can’t be a part of that set anymore so its neighbors can’t be from the set either. That’s why you fall back to photo-stream of the author. Except that most people still expect to be inside of the tag-stream. There wouldn’t be much change if we stayed there, only side-effects would be different. We could only select how to confuse users, not if.
   </p>
   <p>
    As it happens, it’s not a big deal either. It’s confusing at first, but not for very long, so nobody cares.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I relearned is that a tight mathematical model without side-effects, is not necessarily intuitive to human mind. In a way, we compensate for any small idiosyncrasies in a story our brains write from what we do. As with any good writing, we have guidelines that make us write better stories, but at the end it’s not they which matter, but the story itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Interface should only help telling it.

    According to Steve Jobs at Macworld Apple sold 14 million iPods in last quarter of 2005 and 32 million during the whole year. iPod remains by far the most popular portable mp3 player even though it’s neither the cheapest or the most feature laden of available options.
   </p>
   <p>
    So what is it that makes iPod so popular and what does that tell us?
   </p>
   <p>
    For the purpose of this post I’ll talk about the whole family of iPod products as one, since I believe that my points can be more or less equally applied to all of them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     1. Easy interface = happy users
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Using iPod is very easy and when something is easy to do, it’s more likely to also be enjoyable.
   </p>
   <p>
    iPod achieves this mainly by using familiar elements (playlists, slideshows…) and sticking to simple usage model. Even wheel is just an evolved volume knob from hi-fi equipment. Which doesn’t make it less innovative.
   </p>
   <p>
    Exceptions to the mental model are expensive, since they significantly raise the cognitive burden and should therefore be reserved only for occasions when their benefits far outweigh their downsides.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     2. Number of features is not important. Their selection is.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    As already noted, iPod isn’t the player with most features. It’s not even the player with most features per buck.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s a common fallacy to think you need more features than competition. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t add any. A product should certainly meet baseline expectations and have features most of its customers expect. But you should be careful that those it has significantly add to the purpose of the tool.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don’t try to build a swiss army knife.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     3. If you build it (expansion option), they will come (developers).
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    You can’t add every feature and you shouldn’t even if you could. However you should make it possible for other developers to build on top of your product. This way everybody wins.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your budget can be smaller, majority is not bothered with features it doesn’t want or need, but somebody else can add them for those who do. That’s why web services matter and you should think about adding them if you haven’t yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     4. Less is more (minimalism rules)
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Less design, less features, less burden.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s like going on a trip. You can’t take everything you might possibly need with you. You have to decide what’s useful or important enough and make it fit within limitations imposed on you either by airlines or your own body.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     5. Looks matter
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody wants to watch ugly stuff. If we are going to look at it, then it should be pleasant to do so.
   </p>
   <p>
    Flashy designs might get your attention at first, but they age quickly more often than not. Light, understated design might not be so eye catchy, but it’s this inconspicuousness that makes them usable over longer periods of time.
   </p>
   <p>
    To sum up, when I think of iPod, two words come to my mind. Easy and restrained. Are these the same two words you’d use to describe your website?
