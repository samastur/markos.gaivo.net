            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>Couple of years ago I hacked together a small Django app called <a href="http://">image-diet</a> which automatically compresses images processed by Easy Thumbnails as they are uploaded to a website. Its code was atrocious with configuration for external tools baked in, it only worked with <a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails">Easy Thumbnails</a> and Python2 and...I could go on, but it worked and at <a href="http://aptivate.org">Aptivate</a> we have been using it successfully ever since.</p>
<p>Well, I finally found time and rewrote the whole thing. New version is now called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet2">image-diet2</a> because it is completely backwards incompatible and I screwed up versioning of the original one. Mea culpa.</p>
<p>It's implemented as a Django storage backend augmenting default one, but can easily be added as a mixin to any other so it should work no matter which tool or backend you use to upload files. Supporting new compression tools or changing configuration of existing does not require a new release or poking in virtualenv anymore. It is better <a href="https://travis-ci.org/samastur/image-diet2">tested</a>, <a href="http://image-diet2.readthedocs.org/">documented</a> and is not limited to 2.x branch of Python anymore. You really should give it a try.</p>
<p>image-diet2 is actually a thin Django wrapper around separately packaged <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyimagediet">pyimagediet</a> that actually process files. My hope is that others may find it useful enough to use it on non-Django projects. It also comes with a tool to compress images and generate configuration file tailored to your system. If you can think of anything else that would make integration even easier, then please let me know.</p>
<p>There are few bits still missing, but functionality is mostly complete. What I plan to do next is to test different configurations to find how well they work and what are their tradeoffs. Prior useful work such as <a href="http://www.css-ig.net/png-tools-overview">this</a> exists, but I'd like tests to be more expansive and in reusable format. They need to be easily replicable by anyone as their versions of processing tools might give different results than mine.</p>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">

 <p>
  Google Reader for me was never just a way to plow through a large number of feeds, but also a database of important articles that I lovingly annotated with tags and notes when they still existed. Apparently I was in minority, judging by Reader clients and more importantly its own exporting tools which lets you take away most of your stuff, but not tagged items themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence I wrote a quick and dirty Python script which allows you to do just that using
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libgreader">
   libgreader
  </a>
  . You can find
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/GReader-hoover">
   it on Github
  </a>
  and it has few other features like exporting all feed articles. Who knows how long Feedburner will be around so next step will be resolving those links.
 </p>
 <p>
  My current backup amounts to almost 500MB so script is obviously useful to me. Hopefully it is also to others.  If you find bugs or data that is not exported, but should be, please do let me know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am also looking for a good alternative that is
  <strong>
   not hosted only
  </strong>
  service, supports archiving and can process most feeds. Currently I am biased to modifying Newsblur to support tagging and running my own instance, but I would definitely prefer to avoid this work if possible.

            <div class="entry-content post-text">

 <p>
  April is about to end and with it also the deadline to
  <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/">
   submit your EuroPython talk
  </a>
  . I thought about submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my current workload.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not) Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.
 </p>
 <p>
  I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality. It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had to miss last year, feels like home.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I decided to volunteer this year. It’s a way to give a little bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.
 </p>
 <p>
  So do submit your talk and come. It won’t be the same without you.
