    Google Reader for me was never just a way to plow through a large number of feeds, but also a database of important articles that I lovingly annotated with tags and notes when they still existed. Apparently I was in minority, judging by Reader clients and more importantly its own exporting tools which lets you take away most of your stuff, but not tagged items themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hence I wrote a quick and dirty Python script which allows you to do just that using
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libgreader">
     libgreader
    </a>
    . You can find
    <a href="https://github.com/samastur/GReader-hoover">
     it on Github
    </a>
    and it has few other features like exporting all feed articles. Who knows how long Feedburner will be around so next step will be resolving those links.
   </p>
   <p>
    My current backup amounts to almost 500MB so script is obviously useful to me. Hopefully it is also to others.  If you find bugs or data that is not exported, but should be, please do let me know.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am also looking for a good alternative that is
    <strong>
     not hosted only
    </strong>
    service, supports archiving and can process most feeds. Currently I am biased to modifying Newsblur to support tagging and running my own instance, but I would definitely prefer to avoid this work if possible.

    April is about to end and with it also the deadline to
    <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/">
     submit your EuroPython talk
    </a>
    . I thought about submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my current workload.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not) Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality. It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had to miss last year, feels like home.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s why I decided to volunteer this year. It’s a way to give a little bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.
   </p>
   <p>
    So do submit your talk and come. It won’t be the same without you.

    EuroPython 2008 is over. I packed and now I am waiting to leave for the airport to catch afternoon flight back home. Sadly I don’t have time to attend sprints and since I only recently started to write python again, I probably wouldn’t be of much use anyhow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conference itself was great. Smaller than web conferences I usually attend with a more friendly, homey feeling, but with plenty of excellent talks where I learned a lot. I also met a bunch of friendly interesting people and had in general a wonderful time.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was also interesting to compare the whole experience with other conferences I go to. Apple is popular, but there are fewer
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh" rel="wikipedia" title="Macintosh">
     Macs
    </a>
    than at web events.
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="homepage" title="Ubuntu (operating system)">
     Ubuntu
    </a>
    seems to completely dominate
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="wikipedia" title="Linux">
     Linux
    </a>
    crowd (me included), since it was the only distribution I actually have seen and Windows is in minority. Everyone is much more willing to participate to the point, where sadly not all who wanted to present a Lightning talk on last day had the opportunity to do so.
   </p>
   <p>
    I certainly hope to attend EuroPython 2009, which will be in Birmingham around this time next year. At the end I also have a present. Yesterday I got a license for
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wingware.com" rel="homepage" title="Wing IDE">
     Wing IDE
    </a>
    Professional and since I don’t need one, I’ll give it to the first person who expresses a wish to have it in comments and leaves his/her email address in relevant part of comment form.
   </p>
