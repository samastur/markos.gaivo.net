  One of more popular javascript scripts I’ve written is a simple function that hides an email address from spiders by constructing a mailto link on page load. So far it has worked quite well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately I started to have my doubts about this approach though. There was
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mozilla+google+spider&amp;btnG=Google+Search">
   a series of articles
  </a>
  a while ago about Google’s new Mozilla-based spider that I didn’t take too seriously at the time. However, even if not true then, it’s still only a matter of time before a spider like this will show up. The new found popularity of AJAX/Javascript simply guarantees that, since search engines can’t and won’t give up indexing content hidden behind fancy scripts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which means that my script will stop working in not so distant future as will all email obfuscating scripts out there. If it can be seen by a human, then it will be seen by a spider. So is there a way to publish my email address without it becoming public through search engines indexes, which is where most spammers seem to get our emails?
 </p>
 <p>
  I could write a robots.txt file, which would exempt my contact page from being indexed at all. But this is a rather crude approach, since it means nothing on that page will get indexed. I could move email information to a separate page to let other contact data get indexed, but this is hardly any nicer.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I’d really want is to be able to tell to search engines that only a part of my document is off limits. I don’t think there’s currently a way to do this, but if anyone has an idea how to do it, I’d really like to hear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update:
  </strong>
  I think all efforts, including mine, to prevent spammers from collecting published addresses are ultimately doomed. The basic premise of all such approaches is to cloak an address in a way that spider can’t see it or can’t recognize it if it does. By basing spider on something like Mozilla, there won’t be any difference between what spider sees and what user does. There’s a similar problem with recognition. As spiders gets smarter, as they invariably do, you’ll be getting ever growing overlap between smartest spiders and stupidest users until it’s big enough to be unacceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
  So we’ll either put up contact forms or I hope move to defending our inboxes with smart spam filters (those who haven’t yet).
