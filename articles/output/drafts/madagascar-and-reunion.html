        <div class="post-text">
            <p>We have recently returned from our vacation, a month long trip to <a href="">Madagascar</a> and <a href="">Réunion</a>. It was our first long trip outside of Europe in 3 years. We made an exception to our routine of visiting just one country per trip for reasons that had little to do with destinations. We could and would love to spend more than a month in each.</p>
<p>The trip turned out differently than we expected. Our trips usually do and that might be even part of the charm when surprises are not (too) negative, but this one was more difficult than we could reasonably foreseen. Still, even though my wife is not yet healthy, we are not regretting that we went as it was often fun and always memorable.</p>
<h3>Madagascar</h3>
<p><a href="">Madagascar</a> is a large island next to Mozambique in southwest of Africa. It has a sad reputation of being the poorest country in the world that is not in a war. Knowing this still not prepared me for extreme poverty and lack of infrastructure outside of bigger cities.</p>
<p>Country does not have a reputation of being safe, especially in bigger cities and parts of south. First night after our arrival we met a woman at our hotel who has been robbed on the road that day by a group of armed men. While we did take precautions and followed advice of our guides, I still find it remarkable how safe I felt most of the time, even when we unexpectedly got armed policemen to guard our camp in one of the national parks.</p>
<p>We spent most of our time either on road or trekking in national parks which are few places apart from rice paddies where grass may not be burned (but often is). Slash-and-burn agriculture is prohibited, but widely practiced as are other traditions with potentially negative impact on nature and public health. Outbreaks of plague are not uncommon and it is believed they might be connected with celebrations of Excavation, a practice of digging out and washing bones of ancestors every 5-7 years before burying them again. </p>
<p>Still, views are spectacular as is nightly sky in a country completely dark at night because most places outside of cities are not connected to an almost non-existent electric grid. Wildlife, like endemic lemurs or dog-cat like fusa, with its natural habitat being squeezed by increasing population, can still be found and observed in national parks.</p>
<p>We were there for about 2 weeks, which felt enough to get an idea of central and southwest Madagascar, but not nearly enough to experience rest of the island.</p>
<h3>Réunion</h3>
<p><a href="">Réunion</a> is a small tropical island with an active volcano east of Madagascar and west of Mauritius. Administratively it is part of France (but not Schengen area) and feels in many ways opposite of its bigger neighbour even with its continuing influence. It also has a recently won reputation of being the shark attack capital of the world which is why we skipped diving and limited ourselves to swimming in lagoons forming the remaining 3 beaches open and safe for swimming.</p>
<p>However most of our time was again spent trekking inside of the island, in national park, where nature can still look barely touched unlike coast that looks almost completely built over.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on travel</h3>
<p>My original trigger for this post was an article I read during our trip, discussing impact of platforms like Tripadvisor on (non)uniformity of experience. I have an ambivalent feeling about travel writing in general, but as an eager traveller read more of it than would be good for me.</p>
