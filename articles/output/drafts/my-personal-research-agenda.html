<p>For better or worse I always tried to keep this blog fairly empty of
personal content and as short and straight to the point as I can muster.
This post breaks both rules. I know this because I wrote this paragraph
last and all secrets of this post have already been revealed to me. So
if you don't enjoy reading long tracts of personal thoughts, you better
stop now.</p>
<p>Brad Neuberg recently published<br />
<a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html"><br />
a post  </a><br />
that really got to me. I am not a computer scientist and I don't
pretend to be one. I do enjoy the act of programming, but unlike many
programmers I know, it's not enough to make me feel fulfilled. My work
needs to have a meaning I can relate to and challenges I want to solve.</p>
<p>He writes about a need to set your own Personal Research Agenda and I
couldn't agree more. Making the list puts in perspective what you're
doing and where you actually want to go. Even if you can't always work
towards your goals, and I guess most of us have to compromise, it's good
if we are at least zigzagging in the right direction.</p>
<p>Hence I've been thinking of my list since and while I haven't come as
far as Brad in postulating problems I would like to work on, I do have a
general sense of what I want to do and how close I am to doing it. I'm
not surprised by my slow progress, since I was always inept at deciding
what I want to do with my life apart from remaining<br />
<a href="http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000452.html"><br />
green  </a><br />
. So how am I doing these days, if I take everything I've said so far
into an account?</p>
<p>I'm not doing that great.</p>
<p>As those who have tried to contact me in the last few months already
know, I am very busy these days. However, having a lot of work isn't the
same as having challenging work and I can't really say that my work is
challenging. This will change, probably even fairly soon, but it looks
unlikely I'll deal with challenges I want to solve. So that's strike one
in baseball lingo.</p>
<p>Am I working on problems that have meaning to me?</p>
<p>I loved books since I have learned to read and through the years have
only become more fascinated with the medium and what was being done with
it. When I look at web, I feel we're only at mere beginning and I would
like to explore more of what can be done with it. Probably because of my
fairly reclusive nature I care more about malleability of published
content than currently more fashionable explorations of ways to discover
it.</p>
<p>I am also similarly intrigued by mobile internet. As most people these
days I own a programmable mobile phone and unlike most I also<br />
<a href="nokia-770-internet-tablet.html"><br />
own  </a><br />
a tablet. I don't often find time to think about what I could do with
them, but when I do, I just get flooded with ideas I'd like to try.</p>
<p>I can't talk about my work yet, but I can safely say that last two
paragraphs don't describe it. Strike two.</p>
<p>What's left is learning new things. I can't honestly say I haven't
learned anything lately. I've certainly spent plenty of time doing it.
Sadly I have remarkably little to show for it. Thinking about the
discrepancy between effort and time put in and results, I came to the
conclusion that I've simply spent too much time dealing with transient
problems of tools used that produce little residual knowledge. I gained
most by exploring subjects I won't work on.</p>
<p>That's strike three and out.</p>
