<p>As a healthily paranoid person I already block web trackers and use
private browsing when I want to be more certain of my relative
anonymity. That's not enough to<br />
<em><br />
really<br />
</em><br />
be anonymous, but I feel it should work well enough for my needs. You
see, what I fear as much as a company having a good accurate profile of
me is a company that thinks it has one. So I'm trying to starve the
beast of this certainty.</p>
<p>I’ve been behaving like this for years and I’ve seen this more or less
as a dysfunctional relationship between me and companies providing the
service [1].  However after talking to my wife about her frustrations
fighting YouTube for a useful recommendation I realized this was much
too "anthropocentric" view[2].</p>
<p>Legally we may be That kind of relationship is not so much with the
company behind the service as is with its algorithms. Seeking anonymity
on services where you identify yourself does not work anyway and is not
the point either. Instead you may want to try to make it for you which
may be hard if there are no tools for it (sometimes) and feedback you
get is incomplete and changing (both always). In essence dealing with
recommendation algorithms is similar to trying to please a moody and
slightly deranged boyfriend who occasionally does something for you, but
is mostly undecipherable and unhelpful.</p>
<p>Even though I think ability to communicate what should be taken into
account when calculating recommendations and what not is itself a
failure of the service [3], it is still much better than not having
that ability when you need it.</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m not against using web services, but my assumption is that any of
    them might disappear without warning, my data may be lost or
    publicly exposed (usually whatever is least convenient) and is
    almost certainly used for profiling me. If that’s fine for you, then
    go ahead and use it.</li>
<li>A company may legally be a person, but I doubt many see it that way.
    I find my view of companies in itself problematic as I see it as
    this strange chimera composed of people working there and an entity
    in its own right. Or maybe a better comparison would be a host and a
    behavior influencing parasite where it's difficult to say who
    plays what.</li>
<li>Tweaking recommendations</li>
</ol>
<p>
of not being able to groom social objects and actions that feed into
recommendation engines of a certain service.
