  We came from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.corse.fr/" rel="homepage" title="Corsica">
   Corsica
  </a>
  vacation recently and one place we visited was Bonifiacio, a picturesque town in the south of the island. It’s a great place to visit, but if you do, try to rent an apartment in the old town itself – you might feel as a part of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  We stayed in an apartment recently completely renovated by owners and very tastefully designed. Phillipe, our impeccably dressed host, who lived in equally tasteful apartment above us, also provided us with a page full of suggestions on what to do, where to eat and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typeface used for suggestions was
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans" rel="wikipedia" title="Comic Sans">
   Comic Sans
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I admit I was amused at first. Here was this older gentleman showing more taste than me in everything who nevertheless used one of more despised and ridiculed
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" rel="wikipedia" title="Typeface">
   typefaces
  </a>
  around. My unconfirmed guess is that he picked it because it looks friendlier than others.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which got me thinking how bad is Comic Sans really?
 </p>
 <p>
  It obviously doesn’t leave people untouched, since they keep on using it when there are many choices even on most typefaces starved computers. I’ve also yet to meet a person who would hate it and was not interested in type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Popularity does not mean it is a good typeface (whatever that actually means) just as it doesn’t make Madonna a good singer. It does however speak to people unlike so many typefaces which leave most of us simply unmoved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not to be contrarian, but I find it a completely reasonable choice for children party invitations. It may look ludicrous when used on warning signs, but then again every typeface gets misused for texts it wasn’t designed for.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it happens more often to Comic Sans, it’s probably more because it is less general, less bland than, say,
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" rel="wikipedia" title="Times Roman">
   Times Roman
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end I have to admit I don’t have a bigger point than simple admission I’m not affronted by it anymore. I can’t muster a will to protest or even feel annoyed. To me it has become a pop icon, something I wish to see less and in context better suited for it, but at the end harmless.

  A class of bugs I really dislike debugging are those that depend on specific data and affect only a very small subset or just one user. Things could sometimes be fixed so much faster if you could just log in as him to see what is happening. Sometimes this is exactly what we do
  <strong>
   with his explicit permission
  </strong>
  , but I really dislike asking for passwords.
 </p>
 <p>
  First it inconveniences user. He has to come up with either a new good password or go through two password changes. Second it implicitly teaches wrong behavior. Passwords simply should never be revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  That is why I wrote
  <a href="https://github.com/samastur/Impostor" title="Impostor's home at GitHub">
   Impostor
  </a>
  , a Django app that allows staff members (and only them) to login with their own credentials as a different user. Idea is not mine (kudos goes to
  <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201008/django_superuser_login_trapdoor.html" title="Ned's post where idea comes from">
   Ned Batchelder
  </a>
  ), but I like it. To discourage abuse every such authentication is recorded and can be seen in Django admin interface, but can not be altered from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  So how does it work in practice?
 </p>
 <p>
  Lets say that I would need to log in as user
  <em>
   fry
  </em>
  . To do this I would enter as my username
  <em>
   markos as fry,
  </em>
  provide my password and voila, I’m him. This has been recorded so anyone with access to ImpostorLog part in admin can see all such cases, mine included.
 </p>
 <p>
  Impostor may also ease your development by removing need to remember different passwords for testing. This is usually not a problem unless you happen to develop with fake data but real accounts. Like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And again for morally challenged out there:
  <strong>
   you should never login as somebody else without his explicit permission
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Update
  </strong>
  : Thanks Ross for reminding me where idea came from. I updated text accordingly.

  This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won’t, look forward to.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven’t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn’t mean short on value).
 </p>
 <p>
  Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy
  <em>
   The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Pursuit of Glory
  </em>
  . Your soul will thank you for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.

    Costa Rica: A Traveler’s Literary Companion
