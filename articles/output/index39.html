    is wrapping up tomorrow, but today is the last day I am attending. It’s been really refreshing to be at a web oriented gathering without hearing anybody say: “Web 2.0″.
   </p>
   <p>
    I enjoyed listening to talks and learned that I have to brush up my math and maybe learn a new thing or two. I still learned a lot despite my personal shortcomings.
   </p>
   <p>
    My original reason for attending was
    <a href="http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2007/">
     AIRWeb07
    </a>
    , a workshop on adversarial information retrieval on web, because I wanted to learn what anti-spam community is working on and what sort of ideas and tools are being discussed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The answer to an outsider like me seems mainly to be a problem of web spam polluting search engines and algorithms trying to discover spam pages from graphs of connected pages.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a very simplified description, probably even too simplified, and I have to say that I admire the work and ideas done and shown at the conference. At the same time I was very surprised that focus has been so much on links and practically none on characteristics of spam pages themselves (with notable exception of a submission by
    <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/">
     Gordon Cormack
    </a>
    ). I understand that crawlers are somewhat out of vogue in research community, but it still seemed kind of odd.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is as if someone trying to know me would completely ignore what I say and solely concentrate on who am I hanging out with and how do I go about it. It seemed to me that the best way would be to combine both, which is what prof. Cormack proposed as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a way I think I may understand this focus. It’s very easy to add spam links on an open participatory web and obviously nobody can control what gets published on all those pages out there. So it’s natural for search companies to concentrate on points that they do control, like their index.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, I feel as if not enough has been done on preventing stuff like comment spam. Better tools would only lead to more isolated spam pages and therefore to an easier extraction of spam networks from an index.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then again, I don’t do this kind of research for a living and may be only talking nonsense.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other thing that’s been on my mind is a general agreement that this is an arms race and one which won’t be won unless financial incentives driving spammers can be eliminated. Question came up if we should try to break our own protections (as cryptographers do) and how would we fare?
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no doubt that people I met fighting spam are much smarter than most of their opponents, which is why I don’t doubt that they could do it. I doubt only if they should do it.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s not really intuitive that the best thing in an arms race would be to show the other side how to build a nuke. Especially when it seems we are busy enough fighting problem in its current variations. Then again, I’m not convinced it’s a bad idea either.
   </p>
   <p>
    I won’t go much into other talks, as I feel even less qualified to judge and anyone can get a better insight just by reading accepted papers that are all available online. What I heard or read has been in general of a high quality and if this year is anything to go by, then try to attend next one, which will be next April in Beijing.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the way, visiting Banff is a must even without a conference as an excuse, since the place and even more its surroundings are just stunning. And if you do decide to go, do yourself a favor and contact

     It’s a brilliant paper about user interface design, or the lack of it. In the vein of Tufte, but much more applied to software. The tail end of the paper is a little too fluffy for my taste, and the paper would have been better without it, but that’s a minor flaw on what I hope will be an influential paper. I’ll try and get people to read it, but it’s too long for many.

    It pretty much says it all. Don’t let its length discourage you from reading it.

    I’m still a fan of OpenID, even though it lacks solid solutions to some of its problems.
   </p>
   <p>
    Much has been said about risk of phishing and possible solutions, but I’ve been more ignorant than some to a transient nature of OpenID identities. Simply put, even if you run your own server, you don’t own your domain. You just rent it. Thus you don’t really own your OpenID URL either, which makes it a rather risky tool where some sort of permanent identity is needed.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are plenty of cases where there’s no such need and OpenID is in my opinion a better solution to them than existing ones. But it isn’t good enough where something less fleeting is required. Maybe
    <a href="http://www.xdi.org/">
     XRI/XDI
    </a>
    is a better answer?
   </p>
   <p>
    I don’t know. I’m still a fan of OpenID. It’s just a bit less useful than I first thought.
