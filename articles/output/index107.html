  Why is it that we still celebrate national sport teams as demigods and cheer a bunch of guys (or gals) only because they come from the right part of a planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  Slovenia was caught in a basketball euphoria when it looked for a while that it might actually win a medal. Personally, I have no beef with people playing it. I haven’t done it in a while, but I used to enjoy it a lot. I don’t mind people watching basketball or any other sport either. I rarely do, but I do recognize inherent drama and sometimes amazing display of mastery.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also don’t mind cheering in general. We’ve all encountered individuals or teams, who exemplified rare qualities we admire and wished them best luck. I do find it a bit repulsive to cheer for a person or a team just because they come from the right town or a country.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems rather primitive to pick a side mainly because of nationality or locality; as if our nationality is itself a quality worthy of admiration and pride. They are our lot, our tribe, and that makes them better?
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it then a wonder that after all this time and relative progress we still have so much troubles with each other? If intimate human relationships can’t survive feelings of personal superiority, how can it ever happen with nations?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve always been attached to this place where I grew up and culture that shaped me to who I am today and I can’t imagine giving it up. But long gone are days when I felt the same about my nationality and I’d be ashamed if they came back.

  I was reading Roger Johansson’s blog and came to a
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/">
   post
  </a>
  about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">
   top-posting
  </a>
  and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   &gt; Because it messes up the flow of reading.
   <br/>
   &gt; &gt; Why is replying about quotations annoying?
  </p>
  <p>
   Could you please stop with that? I don’t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it’s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn’t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
   <list>
    archives proves this.
   </list>
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it’s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can’t be a reason to howl down somebody.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don’t think I’m a lesser being for it.

  Until recently I’ve been using Python 2.3.x almost exclusively and I thought it was about time I get more familiar with what 2.4 series has to offer. I’ve skimmed the list of new features when point zero version came out and found some things that I like (e.g sets) and some that I disliked (e.g. decorators).
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this time I invested a bit more time to actually read and understand what was on offer and how these features came about. I still haven’t found a need or a sympathy for decorators, although I can see why some people want them. Personally, I believe they’ll more likely be a cause for less readable and harder to understand Python code than they prove to be useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still think Python is a wonderful language, but gone are the days when I was looking forward to each release and goodness it brought. These days I’m afraid to look and discover another feature that helps more with keeping habits from other languages than adding something new and genuinely useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like minimalism in all things and therefore see every new feature as a burden that should be more than offset by its usefulness. I’m not a language designer and hence can’t really say or tell if Python is going down the wrong track, but there is something that I find most annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been thinking about languages quite a lot recently; how we use and abuse them and what impact our language proficiency has on our communications. There’s one thing I find very different with programming languages than those used for normal human interaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s very little optional about them.
 </p>
 <p>
  It really gets my goat when a language feature is defended as being optional. You may have a choice in using a feature, but you certainly don’t get a choice in learning and understanding its use. Even if you don’t use it yourself, you’ll quite likely have to interact with somebody else’s code, which does and unlike with English, it’s not enough to just get a sense of meaning from its context. You actually have to really understand what it does and hence need to be familiar with feature itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might still be worthwhile to add it, but let’s not pretend when we do that it’s completely optional.
 </p>
 <p>
  P.S: Isn’t it amazing that after all these years, we still have a global interpreter lock? Wouldn’t it be better if we worked on removing that disgrace?
