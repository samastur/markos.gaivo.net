        <div class="post-text">
            <p>I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to a bunch of topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only went to two this year. Instead I have collected links to talks I was interested in. However I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. I never get nearly as much out of them as when I listen in a dimly lit conference room.</p>
<p>Hence I recently tried to replicate conference experience at home. I have downloaded the talks<sup id="sf-homeconf-1-back"><a href="#sf-homeconf-1" class="simple-footnote" title="What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download?">1</a></sup> and dedicated a full day to watching them. It was brilliant. I especially liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>that I could focus very much as I can at conferences</li>
<li>it is cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room</li>
<li>line-up perfectly matched my interests</li>
<li>I could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time</li>
<li>that speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when I needed more time</li>
</ul>
<p>However not everything is better and there are aspects I have missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>not all interesting talks are publicly available</li>
<li>discussions about talks or ideas provoked by talks with other attendees</li>
<li>(ab)using power of pausing talks may interfere with your uptake as it can fragment talk's narrative</li>
<li>meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these I miss discussions the most. <a href="http://friedcell.si/">Fry</a> recently came up with a cool idea of starting a (video) talk "book club". The idea, which obviously needs a better name, is to meet fortnightly or so and have a discussion around talk everyone agreed to listen beforehand. It seems like a well balanced proposal to me, but I am curious to hear what others think about. Who would be interested in?</p><ol class="simple-footnotes"><li id="sf-homeconf-1">What's the benefit that couldn't be solved differently of publishing videos on public website but preventing their download? <a href="#sf-homeconf-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back">â†©</a></li></ol>
