  I get a feeling sometimes, that most blogs are an outlet for people to complain about something. I know I do it more often than I’d like to. I’ll do it less, but this post is another rant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately, whenever I read or hear anyone mentioning Apple, my blood starts boiling. Reason for this is quite simple; today is a two-month anniversary since I took my broken iMac to local Apple service and it’s also the day when they let me know, they got another broken motherboard from Apple so they can’t tell me when they’ll be able to fix it. But they can give me my money back.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be awful even if this was the only time I ever had a problem with Apple. Sadly it isn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can understand that every manufacturing line produces a certain percentage of faulty products. I might accept, unwillingly,  that Apple products on whole fail less often than competition and that it’s just my bad luck that got me a faulty computer. But this hardly matters, if you have no real idea when they’ll be fixed, when they actually do break.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think it’s far better for me, as a user, to have a product that fails twice as often, but which can be and more importantly, will be fixed in a couple of days, then something that presumably almost never fails, but when it does, it might take an unspecified number of months before you’ll get it fixed.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, I’m quite certain I won’t be buying anything hardware related from Apple anytime soon. I have to decide if this includes getting rid of this iMac or not. Getting rid of it means I’ll probably won’t get my data back and I certainly won’t finish a couple of projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other dilemma is what to say, when friends ask me about Apple products, which every now and then they do. I had a good experience with my local Apple reseller (more or less Apple only shop)  and would like to recommend them, but it’s impossible for me to recommend products they are selling. Truth may set me free.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish Linux had a better video and photo editing software. It’s the only area I can think of where it doesn’t actually exceed my expectations.

  I’ve been sporadically using
  <a href="http://www.flock.com/">
   Flock
  </a>
  for last two days and it’s an interesting take on a modern browser and social computing. Two features that I found most useful are bookmarks (or favorites, as flock calls them) integration with
  <a href="http://del.icio.us/">
   del.icio.us
  </a>
  and history index. Especially the last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flock indexes every downloaded page, so when you start typing a query in search window, it presents a list of matches from your history. Everytime I try to find a page in my browser history, I find myself amazed at how many pages I read every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s one of those in hindsight obvious features that I hope, expect really, to see in other browsers fairly soon. It’s just makes sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s less obvious how you make money with software that you can’t charge for. Opera demonstrated (and Flock intends to
  <a href="http://www.decrem.com/bart/2005/10/creating-sustainable-value/" title="Description of Flock's business model">
   follow
  </a>
  ) there are other business models that work at least for now. I hope it’ll also work for Flock.
