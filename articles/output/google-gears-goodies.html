    It’s an expected fact of a geek life that interesting technologies and gadgets appear when you don’t have either means or time to play with them. No surprise then that
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html">
     Google Gears
    </a>
    was announced exactly at such a time for me. As you’ve probably read elsewhere, Google Gears is a browser extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer (with Safari coming up) which lets developers create web applications that can also run offline on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
   </p>
   <p>
    Google isn’t the first company doing something like this. Adobe has Apollo, Microsoft is working on its own thing, Mozilla added support for offline storage in version 2 of the fox and there are some less well known attempts like Dojo’s. What makes it special are few things.
   </p>
   <p>
    First, unlike Apollo or Firefox, it’s not a special environment and it’s as cross-browser and cross-platform as it gets these days. Google is also trying to build an industry support for this and Adobe already
    <a href="http://shebanation.com/2007/05/30/google-gears/">
     announced
    </a>
    it will support Gears API in Apollo. Same has
    <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/audible-ajax-episode-21-dojo-offline-on-google-gears">
     already been done
    </a>
    by Dojo Toolkit. There’s also
    <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/05/30/19.06.10/#comments">
     an intention
    </a>
    to make it an open standard by submitting proposal to WHATWG/W3C (and hopefully them accepting it).
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally, I can’t wait to play with WorkerPool API (which seems to be overlooked in all the excitement). Having a possibility of running time-intensive operations in a background without the fear of triggering “unresponsive script” dialog is a wish come true. Even though you can’t access objects
    <em>
     document
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     window
    </em>
    (and hence any part of the DOM). Reason for this is that background scripts don’t share any execution state and hence can’t all access unique objects like aforementioned ones.
   </p>
   <p>
    This might limit usefulness of the API somewhat, but there are still plenty of uses that come to my mind. What also comes to my mind is a problem, that isn’t really technological. Web applications gave impression to public of being fairly safe to use even on public computers (which isn’t really true) and I fear many won’t understand that new tools may now store private data where they don’t expect or want them to.
