 <p>
  Wednesday’s conversation with
  <a href="http://www.friedcellcollective.net/">
   Fry
  </a>
  provoked me to think more about where and when to use AJAX. I thought I’ve got it figured it out, but I’ve discovered that my opinions don’t really match my behavior and I find this a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  AJAX rage of 2005 hasn’t brought many articles exploring benefits and downsides to AJAX. There were few, even very good ones, but I’d like to see more of them and less articles describing latest gimmick or service which would probably be overlooked if it didn’t use an AJAX trick or two.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a dentist appointment today, something I’m sure everyone looks forward to, which at least provided me with ample time to think about this. My basic premise was that we should use technology that already works and use AJAX to build on top of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since basic web model has been around for a long time, is well understood and mostly works, I tried to look at places where it doesn’t or at least not as it should and came to a short list of possible criteria for choosing when to apply AJAX:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Browsers ought to support this, but mostly can’t or don’t.
   </strong>
   Example: autosave support for textarea, which is the most requested feature among my friends.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Browsers support it, but badly.
   </strong>
   Example: progress bar for uploads. I don’t know why you can get a usable dialog for downloads, but you’re out of luck if you want to upload.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Connection problems (narrow bandwidth or high latency).
   </strong>
   If this is a known, but otherwise unsolvable problem, AJAX can be used to reduce ammount and frequency of traffic.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Have I forgot anything else?
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t think these are only valid scenarios for AJAX use, but we did discover that fast serving of well designed pages greatly reduces the need for AJAX.

  One of the downsides of running your own company is that you have to get familiar with things you could never care for and amazingly often make sense only to really twisted bureaucratic minds.

  In Slovenia, if you collect personal information of any kind, you have to register such database 15 days before its first use with
  <a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/index.php?id=2243&amp;L=1">
   Inspectorate for Personal Data Protection
  </a>
  . I’m all in favor of laws protecting personal information and in general I think Slovenian laws are not too bad in that regard. But if inspectorate by their
  <a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/porocila/poroc_ivop_2004.pdf">
   own words
  </a>
  rarely inspects cases that weren’t reported to them and all such inspections seem to be limited to state institutions, what good is such register than anyway? How does it protect anyone?
 </p>
 <p>
  You can read online
  <a href="http://www2.gov.si/mp/katalogz.nsf/(wwwUpravljavci)?OpenView&amp;Count=30" title="Online register">
   a list
  </a>
  of companies that registered their databases together with a short summary of what kind of data they collect and what for. I’ve checked a company where I administered such database for two and a half years (never experienced an inspection of any kind) and it’s quite clear that no one actually checks if provided information is true or complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  What you’re left with is another meaningless obligation you have to fulfill. Preferably by sending them email with data AND a printed form (email only is not allowed). Nice. You can do more work so they don’t have to.

  It seems like ages ago, but it’s really been less than a decade since I was busy being a localization lead of
  <a href="http://www.lugos.si" title="Link to slovenian Linux user group">

  </a>
  . There was a lot to be done and I had great plans how to achieve it with few of us working on it. If only we’d execute my plans timely and precisely, we could make a mini computer revolution in Slovenia.

  I used to believe this old description of me from an Indonesian friend was simply a compliment. I haven’t recognize then how wonderfully he had praised and berated me at the same time. And rightfully so.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I hadn’t grasped then is that setting the rules, making plans and pushing people to do what you think is the right thing to do in general doesn’t achieve much. Lucky for me — and for others — I’ve left after I’ve done my part and hopefully before I prevented others to do theirs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve learned through the years — and spending so much time designing things certainly helped me with that — how subtle changes can have big consequences.

  I won’t pretend I know why and how to fix it. There are certainly wiser and more informed people than me trying to do that and little would be gained by me joining them. But ever since I’ve read

 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands of hungry “barbarians??? waiting for Rhein to freeze so they could risk (and awfully many lose) their lives to enter Roman empire. Not to end it, which eventually they did or to become romans, as many tribes before them. They just didn’t want to be hungry anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on the other side you had a nation too self-absorbed and still proud of their civility and achievements, unable to fathom the fragility of their great civilization,  unable to see imminent end to 12 centuries old empire and rule of law.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s hard for me as european and history buff to not see similarities between then and now and it’s even harder to believe that problem can be solved by simply not letting people in. Like that was ever possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is really bad is not that some of us have too much, but that too many have too little. Or nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I remember when towers fell in New York. I remember my anger at USA, a country I’ve never been to, and the feeling of injustice, of not being heard or simply being ignored. I wish I didn’t and I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, but is this the anger painfully felt in France?
 </p>
 <p>
  We were cooking miso soup today, a dish my wife and I both love and I was thinking about Japan while doing it. I’ve always been fascinated by Japan and its culture and even though I’ve spent a great effort and a lot of time studying it, it was obvious today that my wife is a much better cook and that I haven’t got a clue about the land of rising sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to remember what I was taught in school about it. Or about any other place outside of Europe. It wasn’t nothing. In fact it was quite a lot, especially for time allotted to it. Time — that is — which wasn’t spent learning about history of Europe and even more of our nation in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it’s been clear where the focus was and I don’t think our history lessons are in approach much different from history lessons elsewhere. Simply by choosing the focus of lessons we subtly  or even not so subtly show what’s important and build patriots. So far a sense of a nation seems to be the only way of maintaining a state longer than a few decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time we guarantee and promote ignorance that clearly doesn’t help us and which leaves people like me with profound sadness and too many unanswered questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I started this blog, it was my intention to create a place, where I could share little knowledge that I have as a developer and I intend to continue doing this in the future. But it became obvious today that I’ll be able to do so only after I’ve written this post, no matter how unheard and insignificant it is. I at least have a way and opportunity to speak up.
