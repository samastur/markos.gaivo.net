  This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won’t, look forward to.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven’t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn’t mean short on value).
 </p>
 <p>
  Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy
  <em>
   The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Pursuit of Glory
  </em>
  . Your soul will thank you for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.

    Costa Rica: A Traveler’s Literary Companion
   </a>
   edited by Barbara Ras. I planned to read this while we travelled around Costa Rica, but failed. I read most of it during our last days on the trip and on our way home. Uneven, with some stories quite good while others resulting in “huh?”, but you do see country differently and I would recommend it to all who plan to travel there.

   Eating Animals
  </a>
  by Jonathan Safran Foer. If you care what you eat and especially if that involves meat, you ought to read it. It’s well researched and even better written book that will inform you what “western” meat production means these days. I don’t think I can recommend it enough.

  I returned from
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" rel="wikipedia" title="Costa Rica">
   Costa Rica
  </a>
  two days ago after a month spent there. It’s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn’t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote
  <a href="2009-review.html" title="Last year's review">
   my yearly review
  </a>
  and it’s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn’t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess it’s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as

  , which was mostly

 </p>
 <p>
  I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn’t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won’t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO

 <p>
  I am more optimistic about next year.

  wasn’t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I’ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.

  There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I
  <a href="sabbatical.html">
   plan
  </a>
  to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years…Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).
 </p>
 <p>
  I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?

  , which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why
  <sup>

   ]
  </sup>
  again draws no sympathy from me.
 </p>
 <p>
  So….What do I want?
 </p>
 <p>
  I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like

  will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.

   You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.
