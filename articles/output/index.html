            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>We saw 101 films last year, which still feels mind-boggling to me. We started even more, but gave up on 3 of them. Life is too short to persevere through movies or books you don’t like.</p>
<p>This year I expect to watch fewer films. Not because 100 is impossible to repeat, but I hope visual media will take a smaller slice of our lives. Then again, I’ve just subscribed to <a href="lhttps://mubi.com">Mubi</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I regret seeing them. There were few duds and so many I liked. Clicking on movie titles will reveal my brief impressions of them and I already opened my favourite ones. Selection could easily be different, certainly larger and probably would be if I did it some other day.</p>
<p>List of 100 movies makes this almost certainly the longest post I’ve written on this website even with (very) brief impressions. Enough words then and here’s the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Lady Macbeth (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291600/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I wouldn't start 2021 if I was aware of its source material and wasn't under the wrong impression that it is a kind of Shakespeare adaptation. What at first looks like a story of female empowerment becomes progressively crueler and redeem-less. Florence Pugh is superb though in her breakout role.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>In den Gängen (In the Aisles) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006263618/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A bittersweet look at lives of blue-collar workers in German supermarket. A subtle, moving film.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Zimna wojna (Cold War) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6543652/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A beautiful masterpiece from Pawlikowski. It's as close to perfection as films get and deserves multiple viewings.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Black Bear (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601220/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A split opinion in our household, but I liked it and its surprises even though I also think distressing scenes in last third of a movie could be shorter.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>i'm thinking of ending things (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7939766/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A challenging to decipher, but thought provoking movie beautifully shot by Lukasz Zal with an excellent cast with Jessie Buckley amazing performance.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Diplomatie (Diplomacy) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3129564/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>One of the marks of a good movie is that you are on edge even though you know what the end will be. Based on a play so it's a great choice for those of us who enjoy "talking" movies.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Undir trénu (Under the Tree) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6223806/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Another movie described as comedy or comic by ill-adjusted critics. It's really a dark drama of neighbour quarrelling with escalating effects on both family. Well made even if the events are fairly predictable.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em><del>Return to Montauk</del> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5247776/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Failed to meet even our low expectations and gave up on it somewhere in the middle.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>羅生門 (Rashomon) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I wouldn't mind if some of the fights were shorter, but it is otherwise as good as it ever was and highly recommended repeated viewing.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Ahlat Agaci (The Wild Pear Tree) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6628102/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A Nuri Bilge Ceylan movie. It is probably the most talky drama of his with wonderful performances. Can't recommend enough.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Mot naturen (Out of Nature) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3596492/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>An internal monologue of a man on a hike experiencing mid-life crisis.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>In & Of Itself (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11916302/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A recording of a show made by Derek DelGaudio that is both surprising and thought-provoking examination of identity.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>The Right Stuff (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Worse than I remembered. Full of male bravado that gets in a way of an interesting story largely unexplored.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Uzak (Distant) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346094/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Another movie by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a study of loneliness and frustration from inability to humanly connect. Sad, moving, profound and deserving of every accolade it received.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Bab el hadid (Cairo Station) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051390/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A real surprise. The story itself is a bit thin and predictable, but the pay-off is really in characters which includes the station itself and their inherent humanity. Astonishing that it could be made then and not surprising that public in Egypt found it scandalous.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Dolor y gloria (Pain & Glory) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8291806/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I just love this semi-autobiographical film by Almodóvar about an ageing director facing ill-health and decline of his powers. Tender, witty and beautiful to look at.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>White Material (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135952/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I can see why Haneke is a fan of Claire Denis. A story about a white coffee farmer and her family in an unnamed African country torn by violent conflict at both delivers what one would expect and still surprise and shock you consistently. A complex, beautifully made movie that is rewarding more than enjoyable.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>A Serious Man (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1019452/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I forgot I've seen this movie until Déjà vu feeling got too strong. I'm sure I liked it then just as much as I did now which is a lot.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>La stanza del figlio (The Son's Room) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208990/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>My favourite movie by Nanni Moretti that will especially resonate with those of us who have suddenly lost somebody close. A beautifully developed story of a happy family going through a sudden trauma and finding healing from unexpected source.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Capitaine Conan (Captain Conan) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115822/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A great movie examining what happens to soldiers once armistice is signed and their honed skills become a liability. Even more so when caught in a limbo of less known part of history when the won WWI was not quite over for many of them yet. Gripping, sad and thought provoking.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>L'avventura (The Adventure) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053619/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A movie I more appreciate than enjoy. Cinematography is spectacular, but the movie held me less after the story leaves the island.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Conte d'automne (Autumn Tale) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137439/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Perfectly watchable, but highly overrated. Maybe looks better if you've seen his other seasons movies (I haven't), but although the movie has its delightful moments, the performances and the script just don't click enough for me.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>My Dinner with Andre (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Odd and engrossing movie that practically requires repeated viewing as two hours of non-stop dialog will keep you preoccupied to really think about many ideas thrown out. Greatly draws from main characters real life and it is difficult if not impossible to tell where real life ends and scripted thoughts begin.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details open>
        <summary><em>Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A touching, wonderful film inspired by Truffaut's difficult youth and love of cinema.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Hors Satan (Outside Satan) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666168/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>An odd movie with religious motives. Rewarding and thought provoking for few who won't hate it (I didn't).</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Unrelated (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt01107850/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A Joanna Hogg movie, a subtly crafted look into civilised unhappiness of well-to-do people. Reminds me of her next movie Archipelago.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3797512/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Occasionally funny surreal comedy that mostly doesn't work for me. It would benefit from being significantly shorter. A disappointment.</div>
    </details>

    <details open>
        <summary><em>Palm Springs (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Less surreal than the previous movie and one of the funniest, surprising and surprisingly introspective comedy I've seen this millennium. Just great.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Hail the Conquering Hero (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036891/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Still holds really well and the famous restaurant scene is brilliant (and not just that scene). </div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Le monde est à toi (The world is yours) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6892462/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Forgettable.</div>
    </details>

        <summary><em>8½ (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>A movie that demands a second viewing to fully appreciate, but is pretty great even after first. Every frame really is a painting. I would enjoy it more without the sexism though.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Yi Yi (A One and a Two) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244316/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>I love this bittersweet drama about one family life's choices and regrets.</div>
    </details>
</li>
<li>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Die Verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum) (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073858/">imdb</a>)</em></summary>
        <div>Kafkaesque conflict between Katharina, caught in events, and system that does not care for her. The movie touches on many issues, but is mainly a condemnation of the West Germany press of the time with questions about absolute freedom of press. Worth seeing.</div>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I decided to split TV and films into separate posts this year, because we saw a lot of them, especially films.</p>
<p>Nothing we watched was bad enough to abandon, although we probably should one or two. As usual I bolded those I think stand above the rest and I think either shouldn’t be missed or are very closed to that grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345525/">Donald Glover: Weirdo</a>.</em> Alright.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11649104/">The Pembrokshire Murders</a>.</em> A completely decent addition to the true crime genre.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380768/">Love Life</a> (Season 1 and 2).</em> Fun, but the first season would be better if it stuck to its premise and didn't lose nerve in the middle by making the main character's experience less common.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9112152/">Efterforskningen (The Investigation)</a>.</em></strong> Danish series about bringing Kim Wall's murder to justice without every showing him or mentioning his name. I wish this was more common approach as it worked so well here.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/">Us</a>.</em> Less funny and more moving story than I expected of using family's European vacation to try saving a marriage. Acutely observed and regularly funny.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8129450/">Breeders</a> (Season 1 and 2).</em> Trials and tribulations of parenthood. Freeman and Haggard as always reliably funny and scripts hold up well in both seasons.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5460226/">Search Party</a> (Season 3 and 4).</em> Not for everyone, but the strong acting of main characters and good enough writing keeps me interested in the journey of, at this point, completely unlikeable people.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698442/">Behind Her Eyes</a>.</em> This show felt like a Showtime production. I was too bothered by the main character and unrealistic portrayals of life in London to enjoy the series and the final twist.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9561862/">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> (Season 1).</em> Anthology with a few great (3 robots) and good pieces (like the Hitler one), but otherwise just feel something imagined by a teenage boy: lots of gore, nudity and sex with women characters reduced to whore or hero. Definitely not watching the next season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4192812/">Unforgotten</a> (Season 4).</em> Mostly still very good and moving show which would be great without the last 10-15 minutes that overwhelm the main story and really spoiled it for me with just bad writing.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9569546/">Halston</a>.</em> Underwhelming overall, but I enjoyed learning more about fashion (as it used to be?). I feel McGregor was mis-casted here, but it's difficult to say how much it was him and how much it was script and direction for making me care little about story.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10155688/">Mare of Easttown</a>.</em> Not perfect, but still captivating criminal series with Kate Winslet and Jean Smart as standouts.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11815682/">Hacks</a> (Season 1).</em></strong> Another great performance by Smart in a comedy series deserving of received praise. Hoping for another season.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/">Killing Eve</a> (Season 2 and 3).</em> I enjoyed both seasons, great story and cast but Jodie Comer is simply astonishing.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/">Fargo</a> (Season 4).</em> Different from previous seasons, but still Fargo. Still hoping for another season</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/">Jerry Seinfeld: I'm Telling You for the Last Time</a>.</em> Not without laughs, but another underwhelming (old) show from Seinfeld. At least when judged by his reputation.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/">The White Lotus</a> (Season 1).</em> An overrated show about affluent, but with one exception not rich people vacationing in a Hawaii resort. The more I think about the show, the more annoying it gets. I am definitely skipping the rumoured second season.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11834150/">The Chair</a> (Season 1).</em></strong> I have enjoyed this comedy set in academia a lot and don't care if academics find it a good portrait of it. It  is funny and entertaining, but I also enjoyed more courageous presentation of modern issues than I usually see in mainstream media.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/">The Good Fight</a> (Season 5).</em> I was surprised how little did I miss exit of two leading characters. Still fun for fans and I find the main idea of the season (alternative court) thought provoking.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9055008/">Evil</a> (Season 1 and 2).</em> Created by Kings duo (The Good Fight...) which was the main reason we started watching. Great cast and fun.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5540990/">On the Verge</a> (Season 1).</em> Watchable, but I expected more. At its most interesting when observing continental European views clash with American progressive culture, but not enough to want to watch another season (if it ever happened).</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8310612/">The Other Two</a> (Season 1 and 2).</em> The premise of looking at a family where only those not seeking fame and glory suddenly gain it, is interesting and often funny, but main two characters started to irritate me and everyone feel too flat.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8430356/">This Way Up</a> (Season 1 and 2).</em></strong> Amazing show dealing with mental health and all the obstacles to own's happiness. Genuinely funny too, which is what I would expect from a show by Aisling Bea.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12994356/">The Cleaner</a> (Season 1).</em> I haven't seen the German original, but this version is very good, especially episodes bookending the series.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/">Shetland</a> (Season 6).</em> Season written by someone who knew there will be another one. Ending was a bit weak, but otherwise still enjoyable if you weren't too bothered by daily season changes of amazing landscapes. Filming in COVID times far north is challenging.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12851524/">Only Murders in the Building</a> (Season 1).</em></strong> Definitely one of the most enjoyable shows of this year. Masterfully done and difficult to think of a way to improve it. Can't wait for the next season.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/">The Morning Show</a> (Season 2).</em></strong> Even more underrated in the second season, but morally-complex characters that are not merely a vessels for crystallised messages are an uphill battle for the show's success, especially when connotations do not neatly align with popular ideas and tribes.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12313046/">Alan Bennett's Talking Heads</a>.</em></strong> Successful adaption of 10 (+2 new) monologues for TV. Bennett's humour and humanism makes even difficult parts bearable and monologues as whole enjoyable and acting Is impeccable.</li>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="./the-books-i-read-in-2021.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to The books I read in 2021">The books I read in 2021</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p><a href="./books-i-read-in-2020.html">A year ago</a> I expected to read few books in 2021 and I definitely have “achieved” that for the same reasons as I did the last time. I read exactly as few books as in 2020 and even though I had only two reading goals for 2021, I managed to fail both.</p>
<p>I read one fiction book and it wasn’t a great match. Enough people I like with more clout recommend Niven’s book that there’s little harm in me not joining. If we are friends, then it’s probably not for you either (but I could be wrong).</p>
<p>The other three I read for work and I would recommend each of them highly to those interested in their topics. That is especially true for <em>Inclusive Components</em> which would get its own post if I trusted myself to find time writing it. <em>Every</em> web frontend engineer should read and think about it, but I would also recommend it to everyone who works with them or needs to consider web UI.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kill-Your-Friends-John-Niven/dp/0061690619/">Kill Your Friends</a> by John Niven. Rare books can stand the test of time and current personal mood. This is not such book, but I suspect I would enjoy it and its humour more if I read it when it came out. Last two years especially did not cultivate in me an appetite for despicable psychopaths without any redeeming qualities.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-dp-1491973897/dp/1491973897/">The Manager's Path</a> by Camille Fournier. A concise introduction to engineering management ladder, from tech lead to CTO with lots of helpful advice for each role. A useful read both for those who want to learn about expectations of each role when considering their career choices as those who already perform them and might need some friendly advice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://book.inclusive-components.design/">Inclusive Components </a> by Heydon Pickering</strong>. I bought a printed version of this book because I expected it to have a lasting value and it does. Some small bits have been obsoleted, there are parts I disagree with and I find the chapter about tables weak compared to others, but it's a fantastic book, a goldmine of insights, techniques and genuinely thought provoking ideas.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">High Output Management</a> by Andrew S. Grove. When reading early chapters I didn't understand why it is so highly regarded, but I changed my mind before half way through. It reads as a textbook from a practitioner, building on concepts and ideas from earlier chapters, focusing on building a mental framework to use instead of tips for specific problems. Still relevant after decades in "print".</li>
</ul>
<p>The circumstances and reasons that led to my abysmal reading record of last two years have not really changed, but my outlook has. I feel more thirsty for reading than I’ve felt in a long time and double digit number of books read does not feel unachievable. Of course, aiming for a healthy split between fiction and non-fiction. The list itself is hazy, but I want to read one of the earlier Pratchett’s and god willing, I’ll try not to read any books on management.</p>
