            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I like long vacations and by long I mean those lasting 3 or more weeks. This makes me employable only in Europe which is fine.</p>
<p>Two weeks or less do not seem to be enough to rest my mind and certainly are not enough to get to know the country we happen to be visiting. We almost always visit just one at a time and while a month is not enough either, at least you get a sense of scope and size of your ignorance.</p>
<p>It occurred to me today that benefits to my employer(s) go beyond me being more productive and creative when properly rested. Most organisations, even dysfunctional ones, can muddle through a two week absence of almost everyone. Some tasks might be delayed a bit or done slightly worse than usually, but few things are generally really time sensitive or can't tolerate a short dip in quality.</p>
<p>Longer absences however expose faults and cracks and test the real bus factor of a missing person. They will expose which bits can or are picked up by others and which suffer. Also how much strain team can bear or would need to if that person suddenly left.</p>
<p>You can't really buy this kind of learning other then by encouraging your employees to take long vacations.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="./conference-programs.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Conference programs">Conference programs</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>We went hiking and exploring north of Spain after this year's <a href="http://http://ep2016.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>. Predictably this also involved a lot of frustrations with available WiFi connections. Mobile networks often worked better, but far from reliably so. It is amazing to see how poorly most websites and apps still work in such (common) scenarios with rare exception like Gmail Android app. Keeping all our devices powered required significant planning and spare batteries where possible.</p>
<p>I complained about this before and while it is sad to see how little has changed, this post is not about failing services. It is about web conferences which I believe contribute <strong>a lot</strong> to this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p>Beyond a talk or two on ServiceWorkers or PouchDB there seems to be little interest from conference organisers to help educate developers on how to develop services that continue to work well when connection is spotty <strong>and</strong> battery low.</p>
<p>It is certainly not because users wouldn't care. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2Hlb22mZM#t=1m05">According to Google</a> there are hundreds of battery apps, downloads of which go into 100+ millions. In my own field work I saw that when given choice mobile users will pick services that work better. By which I mean those that use less bandwidth, work more reliably and are easier on battery. I can only think of very few services that have network effects strong enough to be safe from removal, but even their use can be negatively impacted by users limiting or changing their use of the service.</p>
<p>My talk proposal on web's energy use has been widely rejected. It happens. But more disappointingly I failed to find other talks on this or similar topics. Every conference has a right to decide which topics it finds important, but when one is ignored by all of them, it may be correct to conclude that it simply does not matter to community.</p>
<p>If that is true and web developers expect to punt this problem to OS (Android and iOS), then that is a mistake. First, because <strong>this is our job</strong> that nobody else can do equally well. And second, because operating systems are getting better at pointing out problematic apps to users who are willing to remove them.</p>
<p>My hunch is that most developers are simply not aware of these issues. A good conference program for me is not just about what is currently pertinent, but also what should be. Maybe we could have fewer talks on web game development to find space for topics that affect billions of people every day.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title storytitle"><a href="./windows.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Windows">Windows</a></h1>

            <div class="entry-content post-text">
                <p>I got a new <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305CA/">travel computer</a> this week and so far it is pretty much what I wanted. Nice enough to carry and use, but also faulty and affordable enough that I would not be too upset if something happened to it.</p>
<p>It came with Windows 10 which I have decided to keep so I can use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> for testing. It is much nicer than abomination that was 8 and I also applaud Microsoft's accessibility work. Although, personally, ballooning whitespace and interface until <strong>everyone</strong> can read only one line of text at a time, be it on an actual screen or a screen reader, would not be one of my ways of reducing the experience difference in using the system.</p>
<p>I appreciate little touches such as marking connections as metered (and hence off limits for certain traffic) or workaround for updates installation. I still have no idea when updates sneak on me, but at least now I can choose a restart that ignores them.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is really difficult to find out where disk space went and almost impossible to reduce its use significantly. In theory it should be fine with 20GB, in practice I can't get it bellow 30. On top of this Windows defragmenter refuses to move certain used bits and condemns me to a much larger Windows partition than I would pick willingly.</p>
<p>I complain, and it really does bother me, but truthfully it is really not that bad. I think it is actually <em>the best Windows</em> so far that I will not use and certainly a lot better than versions I used long long, my god how long, time ago.</p>
