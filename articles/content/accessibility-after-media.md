  I still haven’t managed to write my promised or planned articles, including framestack technique, but I’m still optimistic to finish them before the end of month. Well, sort of anyway, since time is not on my side.

  The thing that probably hit me most at @media was accessibility and issues surrounding it. I’m still one of those evil people, pushing Javascript too far. But hey, I do care and I’m trying to find good, accessible solutions for what I’m building and failing behind schedule as result. Not far enough to worry yet though.

  I’d just like to add a word or two about situation in Slovenia, where to the best of my knowledge we don’t have such legislation and almost nobody cares about it. What I found encouraging in London was the number of people who cared and I believe legislation has played a part in making people notice.
