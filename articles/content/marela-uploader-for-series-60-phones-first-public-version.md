  I never got a hang of “release early, release often” policy. I’m sure it works nice in practice, but it simply feels wrong to bestow an application to public use that you know is faulty. It should be my job to suffer through its problems until I can’t find any.

  Still,

  it is. First public version of a Marela uploader for series 60 phones written in Python.

  It took longer then I thought, mainly because I overestimated my free time, but also because it grew new features. You can either shoot a new photo or choose an existing one, set its policy and tags and upload it to your Marela account. But whatever you do, you should treat it as you hopefully treat any first release. With utmost suspicion.

  And you should do it in slovene, unless you change code, an easy enough task even if code is a bit messy. I didn’t try to support Flickr, but it shouldn’t be hard to do so for those (unlike me) with free time and without a conflict of interests.

  Have fun.
