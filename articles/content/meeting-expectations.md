    It’s been more than a month since I got my Nokia 770. In that time, I went through numerous spontaneous reboots, which culminated in one never ending reboot loop after an unsuccessful software install in which I lost my Mahjong best times and a collection of ideas for a project at work. I can’t make it connect to company wireless (although at home it works just fine) and built in email client is a piece of crap that barely satisfies the need to check email. There’s no good way to synchronize data (address book etc.) with other devices and I see no reason why included editor can’t handle any text file.

I like the way I can transform it in a little computer with a portable bluetooth keyboard

    absolutely delighted my 770 like a Duracell bunny easily exceeds it. I’ve got a feeling I can make it do whatever I want, limited mostly by my practically non-existent free time.

    I guess I like it so much simply because getting more than expected is good enough.
