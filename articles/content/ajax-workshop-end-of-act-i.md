  First part of AJAX workshop is behind me and I enjoyed it immensely. I hope our participants did as well or failing that, I hope we didn’t waste their time too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back I’m not satisfied with everything we did and I wish I’ve done my part better. I’m sure I wasn’t clear or coherent enough. Fry did much better, but I feel we could do better with examples.

 <p>
  If we ever repeat this workshop, and we both would love to, we’ll have to make it longer, since there simply wasn’t enough time to talk about the details and quirks that can and usually do waste majority of your time.

  If you were there yesterday, then please drop me a line or two about your experience. I’d also love to hear what you want from second part of the workshop, since it’s not too late to change it to suit you better.
