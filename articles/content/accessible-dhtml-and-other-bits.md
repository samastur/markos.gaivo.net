  I’ve been neglecting my blog recently. There was no shortage of news, but somehow I didn’t feel like writing. My mind is preoccupied with other things and where the hell is the cold and wet summer everyone promised?
 </p>
 <p>
  Google announced
  <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">
   accessible web search
  </a>
  for the visually impaired. I see it as a great step in creating an accessible web search for everyone.

 <p>
  Najdi.si is
  <a href="http://zemljevid.najdi.si/?q=" title="Link to map service">
   testing
  </a>
  a slovenian version of Google maps, which obviously can’t be more accurate than its source data, but works very well nevertheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I’ve been most pleased to discover something else. I gave
  <a href="ajax-talk-at-nest.html" title="Link to talk announcement">
   a talk
  </a>
  recently and we spent quite some time discussing AJAX and Javascript accessibility issues. I wish I knew back then about
  <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML" title="Link to accessible DHTML implementation in Firefox 1.5">
   this
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is there a draft of a specification for making widgets accessible, we even got a test environment with Firefox 1.5. I’ve only had the time to scan through specification, so my view should be taken with a big pinch of salt, but my first impression is definitely positive. We’ll see how it develops after I had time to digest it and make a few tests.
