  This is a first post on my new development oriented blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned from @media2005 yesterday, where I got the feeling that either you have a blog on which you share your thoughts and possible insights or you have no good way to join the discussion except few times a year on conferences like the last one, which certainly can’t be and isn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore I decided to make a new start, this time in English and about subjects where I might have a bit more interesting things to say than what happened to my non-existant cat.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, welcome to anyone who happened to come to this place and I hope you’ll find it at least mildly useful, if not entertaining.
