  I thought it would be nice to give a quick update on status of my Marela uploader for series 60 mobile phones. I have a working version, which is about two annoying bugs and a missing installer away from first release.
 </p>
 <p>
  My prognosis of a good day or so development left has so far been correct. I’ve spent a bit more than a day working on it since then and I don’t see bigger obstacles in front of me. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m also quite satisfied with its speed. There are few rough edges where API is lacking, but in general it’s fast enough and not visibly slower than your average mobile Java application.

  I’ll be busy with work for next couple of days, so I expect to release it (together with source) somewhere in the middle of next week. And Python for series 60 phones definitely rules.
