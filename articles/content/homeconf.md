I like going to conferences as I find them a really good way to get introduced to topics I don't know enough about. For various reasons I only could go to two this year and so have collected links to talks I was interested in. However, I really dislike watching presentations on my computer, so I haven't seen any of them until recently. 


Things I liked:

* cheap and comfortable as I don't need to travel farther than our living room
* line-up perfectly matched my interests
* could skip uninteresting talks easily without wasting time
* speakers would wait for me in mid-sentence if necessary when nature called
* likewise if I needed more time to take notes

Things I missed:

* not publicly available interesting talks
* discussions about talks
* meeting new people (which as an introvert I don't do much anyway)
