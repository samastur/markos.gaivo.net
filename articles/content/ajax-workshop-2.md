   We’re preparing a workshop at Spletne urice (???Web hours??? in Slovenian, a weekly meeting of web enthusiasts) that will focus on AJAX, hosted by me and another Marko. Actually we’re preparing two of them. The first one will cover the basics of asynchronous transport and data, the second one will add some DOM scripting and review some AJAX frameworks.

  Being the other Marko I can say this workshop will totally rock. It has to, because AJAX is cool, right? Instant fame, riches and all that.

  Seriously though, I do believe it will be a great experience for those who’ll attend. Everyone is welcome, but only first 10, sorry, 9

  will get this chance because of limits imposed on us by the choice of venue. It’s even free (not likely to happen again any time soon), so price can be hardly something to worry about.

  You can also help us make it better for you by contributing websites you’d like to see getting a makeover and telling us as much as you can about what you’d like to hear there (and what not).

   Update: Workshop is full and registration is closed. I’m sorry not everyone will get a chance to participate, but we might do another one later this year.
