    I’ve been sporadically using
    <a href="http://www.flock.com/">
     Flock
    </a>
    for last two days and it’s an interesting take on a modern browser and social computing. Two features that I found most useful are bookmarks (or favorites, as flock calls them) integration with
    <a href="http://del.icio.us/">
     del.icio.us
    </a>
    and history index. Especially the last one.
   </p>

    Flock indexes every downloaded page, so when you start typing a query in search window, it presents a list of matches from your history. Everytime I try to find a page in my browser history, I find myself amazed at how many pages I read every day.

    It’s one of those in hindsight obvious features that I hope, expect really, to see in other browsers fairly soon. It’s just makes sense.

    It’s less obvious how you make money with software that you can’t charge for. Opera demonstrated (and Flock intends to

    ) there are other business models that work at least for now. I hope it’ll also work for Flock.
