    Today I switched to
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.firefox.com/" rel="homepage" title="Mozilla Firefox">
     Firefox 3
    </a>
    as my main browser. I didn’t want to, because as a policy I try to use most common version as default, but I made a mistake of opening version 3 and since then none of my old add-ons seem to work on previous version anymore.

    If I was still a young pup, I would probably dive into config files, search
    <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" rel="wikipedia" title="World Wide Web">
     the web
    </a>
    for answers and try to fix it. But when you get to 34, time becomes too precious to muck about needlessly and you just want to focus on things you need or better yet want to do.

    So version three it is. This has got me thinking about something else. It’s remarkable how difficult or simply an annoyance it still is to have two version of a browser installed. Clearly this should be possible and is in interest of everyone involved.

    Anyway, enough of ranting. Time to get back to cutting cake…
