    Dear
    <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">
     Simon,
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you’re reading this, then Technorati trick has worked. Thanks

    </a>
    and hooray for modern tools. If you’re not Simon, then you’re lost. Sorry.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve sent you a couple of emails since our conversation at FOWA and they didn’t seem to reach you. Probably just stuck in a spam filter as I refuse to believe they are being ignored.
   </p>
   <p>
    So could you please
    <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/">
     contact me
    </a>
    instead and let me know how to reach you? Any method, even hand written letters, is fine by me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks.
