I still don't know what to think of 2015. Probably won't until enough time has passed. It certainly was completely unlike what I expected and planned, but at least it significantly improved in last month.

I have spent about a third of the year travelling. Work took me to India, Tajikistan and Bolivia. It was physically demanding, especially Tajikistan, where dry climate and poor sanitation led  to weeks of diarrhoea that dried me like a raisin. It was the first time on my travels that I had to visit a doctor. Not only did I not "salvage summer", as [I hoped]({filename}/late-2014-review.html), I spent most of autumn recovering from exhaustion.

Still, even though trips were though and mostly not as successful as we expected, I am glad I got to do them. It was a tremendous learning experience and we met and worked with some amazing people (and some less so). As much as I enjoy field work, I don't expect to do it in 2016.

I did not learn a new programming language and doubt I will next year, but I did start learning Spanish. Little I know was already useful in Bolivia and I plan to continue learning it this year. By the end of the year I'd like to read a book in Spanish (which I did not manage to pull off this year).
