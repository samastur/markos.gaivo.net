    I was playing with a
    <a href="http://www.jeria.net/?p=7" title="Script for reading CSS properties of a page">
     neat script
    </a>
    that reads CSS properties of a given element, but there’s a problem. Fetching background color of an element doesn’t work in Safari, if it was inherited instead of explicitly set in CSS.

    Does anyone know how to reliably get that information?
