Around this time last year [I wrote]({filename}/2015-review.md) that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it **was** seminal, but for wrong reasons and optimism doesn't work for me. The most positive thing I can think of 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.

Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning which is one of the reasons why this review is late. As for once there is a consensus that 2016 was generally awful I can skip going into it.

You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae (who knows since I did not go to a doctor). Since I seem to be fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.
