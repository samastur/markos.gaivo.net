Around this time last year [I wrote]({filename}/2015-review.md) that 2016 will be a seminal year and that I felt very optimistic. Turns out it **was** seminal, but for wrong reasons and optimism doesn't work for me. The most positive thing I can think of 2016 is that it is not 2017. Its horrors were really just an overture for things to come.

Not that 2017 started better. My computer died right at the beginning and editor wiped out most of the early version of this review which is one of the reasons why it is late. As for once there is a consensus that 2016 was generally awful I can skip going into it.

You don't have much if you don't have health and in that regard previous year certainly could be better. I did not eat healthily enough which may have contributed to 3 colds in last months of the year and certainly did not to a pool-side accident which left me with either slightly cracked rib or concussed vertebrae (who knows since I did not go to a doctor). Since I seem to be fine now I suspect it was the former. On the plus side I did meditate regularly (still recommended) and did more than enough recreation. NHS recommendation is 150 minutes per week and we did almost twice that. This year I will be happy if yearly average comes to half an hour per day. I would also like to find a good book on calisthenics to become more flexible without needing gym. Yoga would do too, but I doubt I have enough time for it. I have also shed some of excess weight I accumulated in last year, but still have few more kilos to go. Still, like for so many things, 2017 looks scarier. Operations await my family, but hopefully all will turn out fine.

The biggest change last year, which often felt all time consuming, was freelancing again full time. It was a medium success. I am not in danger of being hungry, am working on things I find interesting and have learned a lot including that I don't like the "traditional" model of freelancing with many, relatively short engagements. Instead I prefer to work on longer lasting projects with at most two clients at a time which is what I am doing now. I am not sure if this could still be adequately described as freelancing or consulting, but it certainly does not feel like employment either. Finding correct label will probably wait until I have a need for one. 

On the negative side I learned how I work best by failing some of my clients for which I still feel guilty and ashamed. Another problem is answering what do I do. For example I invested in [Python](http://www.python.org), but effectively did not use it professionally and this year is shaping to be similar. There is a saying that you are in whatever business your customers think you are in. Clearly theirs and my perception were not aligned and it would be nice if this year I succeeded in answering at least who gets to be aligned.

Interestingly freelancing also changed my perception of time which I never felt I have an abundance of. I can't tell how much of a book I will read in an hour or how many useful lines of code will be produced, so wasting it just gives me some vague feeling of loss. However because money is fungible, charging for time makes such loses more comparable to some things I care about (and admittedly to neither of my examples). It probably is a form of greed even though me getting something is rarely what it ends up being compared to.

It can also be a trap which somewhat paradoxically becomes worse if you raise your rate. I have colleagues who have difficulty taking time off because they now know almost exactly how much that would cost them. But it can also be useful if turned into a question if what I am doing right now is the most appropriate use of my time.

Last year I set a goal of giving at least one talk in 2016. I did 4, most of them on the same topic and while I enjoyed presenting, I do not expect to do it in 2017. Neither will I be setting development goals for this year even as I am expecting to learn a lot. In 2016 I learned 4 different Javascript frameworks because of work and I expect what I do to guide most of what I learn this year as well. Open source work will likely suffer too, but I plan to continue being involved in organization of local Javascript events which I started at the end of last year.

My opinion of the general state of journalism sank to a new low last year, but there are exceptions and I was happy to be involved with [Pod ƒçrto](https://podcrto.si). Even though this year I am trying to reduce my obligations and ambitions, it would be great if I could do more work like that.

I wrote more, but mostly not the kind of things I had in mind when I set that goal. Hopefully this year will be better including keeping the old promise of having a [homeconf]({filename}/homeconf.md) once per quarter.

I intend to find time for a new hobby. Something that is fun to do even when you have only minutes to spare, is not computer related and is hopefully more tactile, like building with Legos that I already have. Also spend more effort learning Spanish.

Still all these is just tweaking life as it goes by. Last year and especially last few months of it, as I observed world with increasing horror, I kept thinking what the right response should be?

[Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/) once said that you should always ask yourself what is the most important problem that needs solving and how you can contribute most.

I feel stuck responding to Aaron's two part challenge. 

First part, identifying the most important problem, suffers from abundance of choice.

There are no problems which I am uniquely qualified to solve.

I have not yet mention a constant item in most previous reviews, a vaguely described and never realized project "Reader", which was supposed to be the solution for me to more effectively process, store and re-discover interesting information found in various sources.

While I still would like such a tool instead of its poor alternative of pieced together services and apps, it will not happen because it clearly isn't the answer to above questions.
