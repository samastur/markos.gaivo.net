I recently worked on GDPR compliance for a client which made me think about privacy policy for my own website. As a non-commercial outlet for my personal musings it is most likely exempt from GDPR under [Article 2](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-2-material-scope-GDPR.htm), but while it may not be required, it is not redundant.

Unlike most articles here this one should be a living document that I will strive to keep current. Let me know if you find it lacking.


## Summary

This website does not intentionally track you. Your internet address gets logged for a few weeks, but is unlikely to identify you. No other information about you is stored on my server or shared with anyone.

Comments are hosted from a separate domain and store a cookie in your browser only if you add a comment.

If you find any inconsistencies or have questions regarding your privacy while visiting this website, then please [contact me](https://markos.gaivo.net/).


## Privacy policy in full

I do not use Google analytics or any other tool for tracking visitors. Neither do I use cookies, which are short pieces of text that can be stored in your browser’s storage and *also* used for tracking.

Your internet address (IP address) is recorded in web server’s logs and expunged after a few weeks. It is collected for easier debugging of occasional server problems.

It is unlikely I would be able to identify you with your address alone unless you have a static IP address for an internet connection that nobody else uses. If you don’t know what a static IP address is, then you almost certainly do not have one.

No other information about you is stored on this website or shared with anyone.

Pages of individual articles use self-hosted instance of [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) to provide comments. It stores a cookie in your browser only when you add a comment and it is used only for a limited time to allow you to edit a recently added comment. If you don’t need this functionality, then you can block all cookies from this domain in your browser.

If you have added a comment and would like to delete it, then please contact me. You can find my [contact information](https://markos.gaivo.net) on my homepage. Please use it if you find any problem with this document or have questions regarding privacy of your web visits.
