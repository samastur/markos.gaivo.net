  I need help. I’m looking to expand my horizons, learn something new and generally make positive and decisive steps to being less ignorant. I’d be most grateful, if you could help me, dear reader, by pointing out interesting and useful resources out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The topics are not really important. I may be biased to deepening my knowledge of history and design, but every topic and more importantly, every resource is a good one as long as you personally find it interesting and it’s accessible to neophytes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is an exception to this. Resources about software and software development should be avoided unless they cover the field from a completely original point of view or were created by an author, who is raving mad. I’d prefer both, but later requirement probably already includes former.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t care about the form either as long as it’s fairly accessible. Books, blogs, podcasts, movies etc. are all fair game, but conferences with couple of thousand dollars entrance fees (or organized in USA) aren’t.
