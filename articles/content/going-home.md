  EuroPython 2008 is over. I packed and now I am waiting to leave for the airport to catch afternoon flight back home. Sadly I don’t have time to attend sprints and since I only recently started to write python again, I probably wouldn’t be of much use anyhow.

  Conference itself was great. Smaller than web conferences I usually attend with a more friendly, homey feeling, but with plenty of excellent talks where I learned a lot. I also met a bunch of friendly interesting people and had in general a wonderful time.

  It was also interesting to compare the whole experience with other conferences I go to. Apple is popular, but there are fewer

  than at web events.

  crowd (me included), since it was the only distribution I actually have seen and Windows is in minority. Everyone is much more willing to participate to the point, where sadly not all who wanted to present a Lightning talk on last day had the opportunity to do so.

  I certainly hope to attend EuroPython 2009, which will be in Birmingham around this time next year. At the end I also have a present. Yesterday I got a license for
