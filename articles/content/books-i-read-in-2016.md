...were very few. This year has been a reading disaster. I have never read so few books since I learned to read. My list would be even shorter if it did not contain three items ambitiously described as books by publishers. If I change nothing this year, I will definitely change this.

Which is not to say I did not read much. It was a US presidential election year and I read too many things that on the whole did not do me much good except further erode an already low opinion of mainstream journalism. I may (or not) come back to this in my annual review of past year. Also watched too much (good) TV.

Interestingly all my reading was done either on tablet (first 4 items) or Kindle (last two), both of which worked well and neither being perfect. However I expect this to be more common as convenience can't be ignored.

I haven't read much, but I can still recommend one book: The Oracle of Oil. Generally, I don't see a point in reading biographies and reading a book from the author you personally know also carries a risk of what to do if you don't like their work. Luckily for me Mason's book is excellent. A meticulously researched and engaging story of a father of peak oil kept me interested all the way through and left me pondering the power of wishful groupthink and (in)effectiveness of data substantiated arguments.

* [AngularJS Up & Running](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured/dp/1491901942/) by  Shyam Seshadri and Brad Green . A good introduction to 1.x version of AngularJS framework that gives you a solid overview of what can be done and how you should go about it without getting lost in advanced specifics.
* [React.js Essentials](https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjI57PWo6HRAhVNeVAKHSQCA0kQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fweb-development%2Freactjs-essentials&usg=AFQjCNFce0pG40bQZb-AQTvziAd2Uxkowg) by Artemij Fedosejev. A gentle introduction to React.js and Flux avoiding rest of React's ecosystem as it does building complex, multi-screen applications. Still good first book to read on the subject.
* [The Secrets Behind Great One-On-One Meetings](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/the-secrets-behind-great-one-on-one-meetings) by Esther Schindler. From a series of recent O'Reilly short books (booklets?). Excellent guide on how to conduct effective one-on-one meetings (or receving one). Recommended for everyone with a job.
* [Designing Culture](http://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/designing-culture.pdf) by Kristi Woolsey. Another booklet, but not as good as the previous one. Too few practical examples and because of author's background it focuses mainly on using architecture/design to influence culture. Still useful if you are in a position to influence or change working environment.
* La Mujer Alta by Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n. Not so much a book as a short story, but it was the first longer text I read mostly in Spanish (with *a lot* of help from interleaved English text). It is a story I suspect just did not age well since 19th century when it was written. Skip unless you are learning Spanish.
* **[The Oracle of Oil: A Maverick Geologist's Quest for a Sustainable Future](https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Oil-Maverick-Geologists-Sustainable/dp/0393239683/) by Mason Inman.** An engaging biography of M.K.Hubbert, the father of "peak oil". It is more than just a story of a brilliant man pushing an unpopular view and provides an opportunity to draw lessons still relevant today.

This year I will achieve my plan of reading more books than last year as I could hardly read fewer. Some fiction would be nice and another Spanish book would be welcome too. My goal is again 15 books, but if I don't read at least 10, then, well... I have a year to think of a suitable punishment.
