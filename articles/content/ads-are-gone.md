  After a bit less than a month, but enough traffic to give me an idea what to expect, I decided to remove Google ads. I earned a dollar. Well, almost anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  My decision to end it was made easier when I discovered this, where ads were supposed to be:
  <br/>
  <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" title="Full size screenshot of search ads">
   <img alt="Search ads?" height="65" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" style="border: thin solid #666; margin: 5px;" width="370"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wtf?
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to follow Google’s advice. I picked the most successful formats (but also experimented with others), put them at premium places and choose colors that blend in. Result was a buck and a revelation that on my site even old-fashion banners would be more profitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have no real explanation for disappointing results. Since I’m not fond of ads either, I stayed with number of ad boxes I felt most comfortable with (usually just one) and used only text ads. It’s possible that I’d have more luck with image ads, but it doesn’t really matter, since I dislike them enough that they wouldn’t be acceptable anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s also possible and even probable, that the problem was with content of pages. I’ve certainly noticed what often seemed at best a poor match between displayed content and ads.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadly there weren’t enough clicks to merit a more involved analysis. Maybe some other time, when I have a new idea worth exploring and get better results.

  What has been your experience with AdSense?
