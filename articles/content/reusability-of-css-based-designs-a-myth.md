  Have you ever created a new design for an existing website without changing XHTML templates?
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not talking about designs for
  <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">
   css Zen Garden
  </a>
  and its imitators or any other occasion where doing so was done to prove a point. What I mean is building a new design on existing XHTML template during normal course of action.
 </p>
 <p>
  I haven’t and I don’t know anyone who did. It’s also hard to imagine being otherwise if designs are done without taking existing XHTML into account. There’s always an element missing for attaching a part of your design to, unless XHTML was somewhat loose to begin with.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t think this is a problem. There are plenty of real benefits to table-less designs and few, if any deficiencies. However, I do believe that this benefit, touted by many including me, is contrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or am I just wrong? What’s your experience?
