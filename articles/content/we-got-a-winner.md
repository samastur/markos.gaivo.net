    <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/10/_and_the_winner.html">
     the winner
    </a>
    of addEvent competition. Announcement was immediately followed by a lively discussion and it seems javascript community is not persuaded. Neither am I.

    I’m not happy with the code I’m using right now and I was hoping to replace it with the winner. However, I do believe there are real problems with winning entry, so I won’t be using it quite yet.
