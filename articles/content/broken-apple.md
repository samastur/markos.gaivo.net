  and iTunes too. Video watching is in. Now you can watch video on your iPod and you can buy (if you have access to iTunes USA store) episodes of ABC’s popular shows, but in ridiculously small format (320×240).

  Personally, I doubt I’ll be buying anything made by Apple anytime soon. My iMac still hasn’t been repaired and I have no idea when it will be. I wouldn’t have spare macs lying around even if I could afford it and this makes them more or less unusable to me for professional work.
