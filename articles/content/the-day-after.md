    Yesterday I gave my very first talk in English. Broken English, to be sure, but hopefully good enough to be understood. I’m grateful to everyone who came and I hope you didn’t feel like your time was wasted.

    In any case, if you can spare a moment or two, I’d love to hear your honest thoughts about it.
