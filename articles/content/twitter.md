  I have ignored
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.twitter.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Twitter">
   Twitter
  </a>
  for a long time until it became obvious to me that lots of interesting stuff moved there and can’t be easily found elsewhere. So I made
  <a href="http://twitter.com/samastur" title="My twitter home">
   my home
  </a>
  to make following others easier and occasionally tweet something myself.

  So far I haven’t really got a hang of it yet and my stream is as boring as it gets. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come.
