    Ever since I created my first blog, comment spam was an ever present evil. I can imagine it must be really annoying on very popular blogs with lots of comments, but the variety I have is more puzzling than anything else.

   <p>
    What’s the purpose of producing spam comments that can’t pass even a simple filter included in default installation of WordPress?

    I find it highly incredible that someone would be competent enough to write a spamming software and incompetent enough to avoid the only trap WordPress presents. Or is there a benefit to blog spam no one else but me sees?
   </p>

    There are other problems with it that make it easy to recognize and handle it. I’m grateful, because I don’t have to annoy anyone with captchas or other comment preventing mechanisms.
