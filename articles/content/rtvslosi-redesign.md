  Slovenian national television has a

  . It’s certainly better than what they had before, but it’s far from perfect.

  some of the graver errors. But his list is not nearly complete and here are some issues that bother me most:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   not only is Javascript often inlined, it’s also not degradable (crap like href=”javascript:void really has no place in modern web development)
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divitis" title="Description of divitis">
    divitis
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   inline CSS
  </li>
  <li>
   ridiculously long list of external resources (87 on main page), which result in excruciatingly long page loads on connections with high latency
  </li>
  <li>
   poor contrast between text and background in large parts of a page can be an accessibility problem
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  I could go on, but I don’t want to complain too much. As I’ve said before, this page is a clear improvement over the previous one and it’s also obvious from it that their creators do care about modern development and its often forgotten parts like accessibility.  This is exactly the reason why I decided to write about its failings and not about some other, more atrocious one.

  shows an ambition for good designs and although I don’t think they’re quite there yet, I’m sure they soon will be.

 <p>
  And I guess my notion that there’s no need for workshops on XHTML, CSS and web standards in general has been proven wrong.
