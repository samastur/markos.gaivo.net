  I normally don’t care much about games and write about them even less. But I get really annoyed when I see the same idiotic argument repeated again and again. As Eurogamer via TheRegister

   SCE UK Managing Director Rat Maguire said: “I don’t think it’s an expensive machine – I think actually, it’s probably a cheap machine. If you think a Blu-Ray player by itself might be £600-700, and we’re coming in at just £425, it’s a bargain.”

  Cheaper than (outrageously) expensive is not necessarily cheap, it might be just less expensive. Personally, if people were screaming at me that 425 quid is too much as much as they do at Sony lately, I’d rather worry if 600 pounds price will simply be a disaster.
