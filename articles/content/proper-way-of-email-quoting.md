  I was reading Roger Johansson’s blog and came to a
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/">
   post
  </a>
  about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between

   top-posting
  </a>
  and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   &gt; Because it messes up the flow of reading.
   <br/>
   &gt; &gt; Why is replying about quotations annoying?
  </p>
  <p>
   Could you please stop with that? I don’t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it’s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn’t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
   <list>
    archives proves this.
   </list>
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it’s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can’t be a reason to howl down somebody.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don’t think I’m a lesser being for it.
