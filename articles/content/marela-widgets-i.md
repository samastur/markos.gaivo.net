    It’s the beginning of August, heat is temporarily gone and I wish it took work with it. But no, it’s still lying there and there’s enough of it that I have some problems deciding what to do first.
   </p>
   <p>
    So how do you solve a problem like that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally, I goof off by writing something fun (still more useful than reading blogs). For example a simple javascript file based on my
    <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/code/marela.html" title="link to Marela Javascript library">
     Marela library
    </a>
    that allows me (or you) to insert a single random image from your chosen Marela photostream like this:
   </p>
   <p>
    <script src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;size=2" type="text/javascript">
    </script>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you don’t believe me just reload this page and look at its source.
   </p>
   <p>
    See? Told you.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you want to do the same, but don’t want to show my images on your page, just insert
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>
     <br/>
     &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://markos.gaivo.net/marela/singlerandom.js?username=markos&amp;tag=moja-izbira&amp;size=2"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
     <br/>
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>
    in your page and replace
    <em>
     markos
    </em>
    with your Marela username (contact me, if you need an account) and
    <em>
     moja-izbira
    </em>
    with your chosen tag. You can specify the size of an image with a number from 1 to 3 (2 being default if attribute is missing).
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll write some more widgets like this through August, if I don’t change my mind. Hence the title of this post.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also I’ll write Javascript for first 5 souls who need it as long as it’s a problem that won’t take too much of my time. This offer expires at the end of this month.
