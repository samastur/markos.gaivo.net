    April is about to end and with it also the deadline to
    <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/cfp/">
     submit your EuroPython talk
    </a>
    . I thought about submitting a proposal, but realized it would be nuts to do so with my current workload.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would also be nuts not to go and if you are a European (or not) Python developer you owe it to yourself to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    I go to a few conferences every year and each has its own personality. It is sometimes hard to point at what makes them (feel) different, but they just are. I like many, but only EuroPython, which I regretfully had to miss last year, feels like home.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s why I decided to volunteer this year. It’s a way to give a little bit back, like cleaning dishes when you visit mom.
   </p>
   <p>
    So do submit your talk and come. It won’t be the same without you.
