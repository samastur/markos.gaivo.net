  Dear LazyWeb,
 </p>
 <p>
  Iâ€™m looking for a shop that sells
  <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/770" title="Tablet's homepage">
   Nokia 770 Internet Tablet
  </a>
  and is willing to ship it for a reasonable fee to Slovenia. Our
  <a href="http://www.teleray.si/" title="Official Slovenian Nokia distributor">
   official Nokia distributor
  </a>
  has failed me miserably in this regard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>

  </strong>
  Expansys managed to deliver navigation kit without the tablet. Hopefully this problem will be amicably resolved after holidays (since nobody could be reached yesterday afternoon).
