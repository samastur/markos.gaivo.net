  two days ago after a month spent there. It’s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn’t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.
