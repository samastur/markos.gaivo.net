  I’ve just read

   Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Heuristics

  and it’s a great introduction to technics and problems encountered in the field. It didn’t make me an expert, but I can fake one at parties. If you have time and interest, I certainly recommend getting a copy.

  I missed one thing. I’ve been thinking and reading about search engines for a while now, as time permits, and the underlying premise of all (known to me) seems to be to find a document that answers your query.  What happens if such document doesn’t exist, but the answer can be constructed from multiple sources?

  I know this problem has been explored, but being a layman I would welcome at least few pages that described what has been done so far and where to look for more information. Any recommendation for a book or a website that addresses this topic is most welcome.
