  It’s here. After months of hoping and weeks of waiting, little white-green computer is finally here, on my desk:

  It’s too early for anything but first impressions, but unlike some people mine are completely positive. This doesn’t mean everything works. It doesn’t like WPA-enabled wifi in our flat. Some parts are a bit flaky or unfinished. But on the whole I haven’t found problems yet that weren’t already documented on project’s wiki and in general it certainly works better than I expected.

  Time will tell if this infatuation will last, although I don’t see why not, since it offers everything I hoped for my projects. As a side note, if you live in Slovenia and someone sends you G1G1, be prepared to pay VAT also for the one that was bought abroad and shipped elsewhere. Yet another thing beyond my comprehension.
