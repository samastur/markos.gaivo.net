  I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who’s a recent Python convert and he was explaining to me which parts of Python are not to his liking. Mostly he had reasonable objections.

  I can understand his wish for strong typing, but since lack of it is not a problem that affected me yet, I’m not bothered by it. I’ll take his word that objects pickled on Windows are not transferable to Linux and that certainly can suck. But it was probably the smallest problem that resonated the strongest with me, since it was something that has annoyed me previously.

  Bisect module doesn’t let you specify comparison function. It obviously doesn’t need to, since you can define your own comparison methods on your classes, but still, it would be nice if its documentation included a hint for those who won’t look at module’s code or think of simply trying. You know, people like me.

  It got me thinking that I don’t find all modules in standard library of the same quality and I suspect I’m not the only one. I don’t mean to or honestly can disparage anyone, since I haven’t seen any code in standard library that would be worse than mine.

  Still, which modules do you think would benefit from some work and how could an eager person, with some time on his hands, help them improve?
