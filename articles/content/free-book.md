  I’ll give
  <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jscript4/" title="Book's homepage">
   4th edition
  </a>
  of Javascript, the Definitive Guide by David Flanagan to person who emails me first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The book is in excellent condition even though it’s been in my hands a lot and I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Javascript. I’d still cling to it, if I haven’t received 5th edition as Christmas gift.

  Lucky recipient will be able to claim it at next

   Wednesday talk
  </a>
  , whenever it will be.
