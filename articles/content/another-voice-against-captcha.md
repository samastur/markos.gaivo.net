    I tried to leave a comment on
    <a href="http://www.digg.com/">
     Digg
    </a>
    recently and had trouble deciphering its
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">
     CAPTCHA
    </a>
    . I was eventually successful, but only after I got annoyed. Simply put, CAPTCHAs are evil.

    There’s no need to rehash why, since
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+accessibility">
     plenty
    </a>
    has been said so far. They
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">
     don’t
    </a>
    really work and they
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Accessibility">
     exclude
    </a>
    lots of people even if you do use an alternative audio check. As a left-handed person, who curses every time he picks up an “ergonomically” designed scissors, I kind of imagine how it is when things are designed for a majority you don’t belong to.

    However, even if you could make them completely accessible (doubtful) and would somehow be able to resolve the overlap between smartest programs and, well, less-gifted humans (impossible), I’d still dislike them. What they say to your readers is: “I’ll make you work so I don’t have to.”

    Is this the message you want to communicate?

    P.S: WordPress users, you really ought to take a look at
    <a href="http://akismet.com/">
     Akismet
    </a>
    , if you haven’t done so.
