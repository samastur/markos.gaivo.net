I decided to split TV and films into separate posts this year, because we saw a lot of them, especially films.

Nothing we watched was bad enough to abandon, although we probably should one or two. As usual I bolded those I think stand above the rest and I think either shouldnâ€™t be missed or are very closed to that grade.

* *[Donald Glover: Weirdo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345525/).* Alright.
* *[The Pembrokshire Murders](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11649104/).* A completely decent addition to the true crime genre.
* *[Love Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380768/) (Season 1 and 2).* Fun, but the first season would be better if it stuck to its premise and didn't lose nerve in the middle by making the main character's experience less common.
* ***[Efterforskningen (The Investigation)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9112152/).*** Danish series about bringing Kim Wall's murder to justice without every showing him or mentioning his name. I wish this was more common approach as it worked so well here.
* *[Us](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/).* Less funny and more moving story than I expected of using family's European vacation to try saving a marriage. Acutely observed and regularly funny.
* *[Breeders](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8129450/) (Season 1 and 2).* Trials and tribulations of parenthood. Freeman and Haggard as always reliably funny and scripts hold up well in both seasons.
* *[Search Party](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5460226/) (Season 3 and 4).* Not for everyone, but the strong acting of main characters and good enough writing keeps me interested in the journey of, at this point, completely unlikeable people.
* *[Behind Her Eyes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698442/).* This show felt like a Showtime production. I was too bothered by the main character and unrealistic portrayals of life in London to enjoy the series and the final twist.
* *[Love, Death & Robots](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9561862/) (Season 1).* Anthology with a few great (3 robots) and good pieces (like the Hitler one), but otherwise just feel something imagined by a teenage boy: lots of gore, nudity and sex with women characters reduced to whore or hero. Definitely not watching the next season.
* *[Unforgotten](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4192812/) (Season 4).* Mostly still very good and moving show which would be great without the last 10-15 minutes that overwhelm the main story and really spoiled it for me with just bad writing.
* *[Halston](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9569546/).* Underwhelming overall, but I enjoyed learning more about fashion (as it used to be?). I feel McGregor was mis-casted here, but it's difficult to say how much it was him and how much it was script and direction for making me care little about story.
* *[Mare of Easttown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10155688/).* Not perfect, but still captivating criminal series with Kate Winslet and Jean Smart as standouts.
* ***[Hacks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11815682/) (Season 1).*** Another great performance by Smart in a comedy series deserving of received praise. Hoping for another season.
* *[Killing Eve](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/) (Season 2 and 3).* I enjoyed both seasons, great story and cast but Jodie Comer is simply astonishing.
* *[Fargo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/) (Season 4).* Different from previous seasons, but still Fargo. Still hoping for another season
* *[Jerry Seinfeld: I'm Telling You for the Last Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/).* Not without laughs, but another underwhelming (old) show from Seinfeld. At least when judged by his reputation.
* *[The White Lotus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/) (Season 1).* An overrated show about affluent, but with one exception not rich people vacationing in a Hawaii resort. The more I think about the show, the more annoying it gets. I am definitely skipping the rumoured second season.
* ***[The Chair](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11834150/) (Season 1).*** I have enjoyed this comedy set in academia a lot and don't care if academics find it a good portrait of it. It  is funny and entertaining, but I also enjoyed more courageous presentation of modern issues than I usually see in mainstream media.
* *[The Good Fight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5853176/) (Season 5).* I was surprised how little did I miss exit of two leading characters. Still fun for fans and I find the main idea of the season (alternative court) thought provoking.
* *[Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9055008/) (Season 1 and 2).* Created by Kings duo (The Good Fight...) which was the main reason we started watching. Great cast and fun.
* *[On the Verge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5540990/) (Season 1).* Watchable, but I expected more. At its most interesting when observing continental European views clash with American progressive culture, but not enough to want to watch another season (if it ever happened).
* *[The Other Two](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8310612/) (Season 1 and 2).* The premise of looking at a family where only those not seeking fame and glory suddenly gain it, is interesting and often funny, but main two characters started to irritate me and everyone feel too flat.
* ***[This Way Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8430356/) (Season 1 and 2).*** Amazing show dealing with mental health and all the obstacles to own's happiness. Genuinely funny too, which is what I would expect from a show by Aisling Bea.
* *[The Cleaner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12994356/) (Season 1).* I haven't seen the German original, but this version is very good, especially episodes bookending the series.
* *[Shetland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396135/) (Season 6).* Season written by someone who knew there will be another one. Ending was a bit weak, but otherwise still enjoyable if you weren't too bothered by daily season changes of amazing landscapes. Filming in COVID times far north is challenging.
* ***[Only Murders in the Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12851524/) (Season 1).*** Definitely one of the most enjoyable shows of this year. Masterfully done and difficult to think of a way to improve it. Can't wait for the next season.
* ***[The Morning Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/) (Season 2).*** Even more underrated in the second season, but morally-complex characters that are not merely a vessels for crystallised messages are an uphill battle for the show's success, especially when connotations do not neatly align with popular ideas and tribes.
* ***[Alan Bennett's Talking Heads](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12313046/).*** Successful adaption of 10 (+2 new) monologues for TV. Bennett's humour and humanism makes even difficult parts bearable and monologues as whole enjoyable and acting Is impeccable.
