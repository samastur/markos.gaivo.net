    Another piece of chicken fillet went into the trash bin, because I didn’t check its expiration date when I bought it a few days ago and hence didn’t see it expired on the same day.

    Would it be really that hard to clearly label food that is going to expire in a couple of days?

    As a customer I’d appreciate this greatly as it would allow me to plan a little bit better by when to use what. Either no one has thought of something so obvious or

    finds it worthwhile to aggravate me for few dollars. Lucky for them their competition isn’t any better so this might not even cost them a customer.
