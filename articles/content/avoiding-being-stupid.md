  Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to
  <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">
   set things right
  </a>
  . No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I’ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?
  </em>
  <br/>
  You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are

  <em>
   How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?
  </em>
  <br/>
  Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Why am I trying to say this?
  </em>
  <br/>
  Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Is it a matter of a principle or degree?
  </em>
  <br/>
  I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight

 <p>
  <em>
   Can I be persuaded?
  </em>
  <br/>
  I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t always run through all these questions, but I’m sure I’m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.
