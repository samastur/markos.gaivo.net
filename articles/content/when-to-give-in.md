  Probably the most common misfortune every creator encounters is that something he thought up doesn’t or won’t work as planned and it has to be changed. In a way half of work is done by just recognizing and accepting that it doesn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  But how do you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Our change of image navigation was in retrospect quite easy. As a friend said: “You don’t have to satisfy everyone, but you should satisfy at least somebody.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t easy for me, because I was quite attached to it and I failed to recognize it as a problem. And this wasn’t even a close call.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, how do you decide when to give in to requests conflicting with your vision?
 </p>
 <p>
  Relying on a personal hunch might work for a while, but as a long-term strategy it’s probably not much better than rolling a dice.
