  I’ve been writing less lately, which had little to do with summer laziness and more with me thinking about publishing on the web.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many have said that Internet (or Web) is not a television, but neither is it a magazine or a book. Yet I find myself again and again leaning on preconceptions picked up from my favorite medium. So this summer has been spent exploring my preconceived notions and trying to find out which of them still make sense on the web and how to tackle those which don’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the result of this exploration? I still don’t like WordPress, so I might go about writing my own publishing platform which would offer me an opportunity to test some of newfound ideas. Or I won’t, recognizing vast amount of time needed and I’ll end up only writing an article or two. But what I’m certain I will do is write less.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a world where every monkey can publish so almost every one of us eventually does restraint is a virtue. There were too many posts that neither benefited me nor those who came across them. Maybe I won’t change the signal-noise ratio, but I will put less crap out there in absolute terms.
 </p>

  Related to all these thinking is a recent announcement of
  <a href="http://hyperscope.org/">
   HyperScope
  </a>
  . Doug Engelbart’s vision of
  <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augment-132082.opml">
   Open Hyperdocument System
  </a>
  (link may not work in every browser) has been a source of many ideas this summer and it’s certainly nice to finally have available a system to test at least some of them.
