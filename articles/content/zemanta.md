  Yesterday was my last working day at my
  <a href="http://www.noovo.com/">
   current job
  </a>
  . I will start working at
  <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/">
   Zemanta
  </a>
  next Friday, where I will take over from
  <a href="http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog/" title="Jure's blog">
   Jure
  </a>
  as a head of front-end development. I really admire what Jure and his team have done so far and it will be a real challenge to keep up with his tempo. I’m also looking forward to solving problems that will make our extension, which I’m sure you already have, even more friendly and useful. Hopefully some of those problems will result in content on this blog that is worth reading.

  In the meantime I have few days of vacation that will hopefully be spent on resting and cleaning up various tasks that pilled up in last few months.
