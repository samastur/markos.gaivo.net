  I use
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://gmail.com" rel="homepage" title="Gmail">
   Gmail
  </a>
  mainly for reading mailing lists. I’m old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control it, but otherwise I can’t fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can’t). Go to the Lab tab in settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type is:unread in search box and confirm.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists unread messages. It’s not perfect though. It won’t show you how many messages are unread and you can’t subscribe to it through
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="Internet Message Access Protocol">
   IMAP
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The other thing that is not perfect is
  <a class="zem_slink" href="http://docs.google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google Docs">
   Google Docs
  </a>
  , which I quite like. I did encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I imagine it might be in not too distant future.

 <p>
  How do you move documents between accounts?
 </p>
 <p>
  What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it seems I can’t transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is not only not obvious, but also doesn’t work all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would love to hear them.

  even faster than usual.
