			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I had a problem today. Given two database tables with first having a foreign key pointing to second, find those rows in second table, which are not pointed to from first. Well, it was slightly more complicated than this, but this was the tricky part.</p>
<p>I tried to solve my problem using <a title="SQL description on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, but I could not. I am not saying it can&#8217;t be done, but with my limited knowledge of SQL I could not produce a query that would not perform horribly. Working on production database under heavy use made this a real no-go.</p>
<p>After trying to come up with pure solution I finally gave up and decided to solve this problem pragmatically with some scripting. Turns out that too was more complicated than necessary. Unix shell tools are all you actually need, provided your dataset is not too big for your computer limitations (mostly memory).</p>
<p>Instead of searching for those rows directly, I changed my plan to create two sets of rows, first containing all possible candidates and second containing those from first set which are pointed to from first table. Subtracting second set from first would therefore give me exactly those rows which aren&#8217;t pointed to.</p>
<p>If file <em>all</em> contains a row-per-line list of all candidates and <em>linked</em> a similar list of those that are linked to, then you can get non-linked by running following command:</p>
<p><code>cat all linked | sort | uniq -u &gt; non_linked</code></p>
<p>What this does is following. <em>Sort</em> will put duplicated rows together and <em>-u</em> option of <em>uniq</em> will display only unique lines which are those that can be found only in <em>all</em>. Problem solved.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1005" rel="bookmark">Passion</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Hearing something often enough can really change my perspective even on things I agreed with completely beforehand. It happened again after reading for umpteenth time that passion for programming/company vision is the quality every new hire should have.</p>
<p><em>Passion is a symptom, not a diagnosis.</em></p>
<p>I know a great developer with whom I would love to work again who is passionate about electronics. I am sure he likes programming and does it a lot, but it&#8217;s not where his heart truly lies. Which is alright because his other qualities more than make up for any passion deficiencies.</p>
<p>Passion in complementary direction is doubtless a positive signal, but I simply do not believe that <em>only</em> people working on something they care deeply about are able to do it well. We can and do regularly care, with some degree of autonomy, about more than one thing (or person).</p>
<p>In more general sense my feeling is obviously a reaction to the end result of a process in which a useful guideline calcifies into dogma. Ideally I could get to this point sooner, but it seems unlikely. If I regularly reconsidered and doubted every piece of my mental framework, then it would mostly be mental and not much of a framework.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=936" rel="bookmark">Save bandwidth switch</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Michal Migurski recently posted <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/bandwidth.html">an article</a> about download sizes of popular websites. I couldn&#8217;t replicate his results<sup><a id="save-bandwidth-1" href="#save-bandwidth-note-1">[1]</a></sup>, but it is obvious that gist of Michal&#8217;s article is correct, websites have indeed ballooned significantly in last few years.</p>
<p>This blog&#8217;s homepage has a footprint of around 250KB-270KB<sup><a id="save-bandwidth-2" href="#save-bandwidth-note-2">[2]</a></sup>. About 90% of its size are fonts and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which is a big penalty for making it look and behave a bit nicer. So should I remove those parts?</p>
<p>Well, for most visitors to this website that difference doesn&#8217;t matter. Pages for them are neither slow nor expensive to load. Unless of course they are doing it over your average hotel Wi-Fi or a slow mobile network where speed around 56Kb/s is not unheard of. On such connection it would take about half a minute to load this blog. It can also cost more than 10 euro cents to load it when roaming in Europe.</p>
<p>It would be great if I could offer a choice of serving bigger and nicer or smaller and faster version depending on visitors needs.</p>
<p>Measuring speed is not easy, but certainly doable as Gmail has demonstrated. You could start a timer immediately in page header, measure how much time it takes to load a smaller version of a website and if that happened quickly enough upgrade it to full bling. Android browser also added support for <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/index.html">navigator.connection</a> Javascript property which, where it exists, probably has more details than you would need.</p>
<p>However there is no way to measure price of a visit. Even if I could, how would I decide what is too expensive for an anonymous reader and should I make such decisions at all? I think not.</p>
<p>Gmail&#8217;s approach is really just a band-aid over what should be a visitor&#8217;s decision. I use same laptop and browser at home and while I travel, experiencing all combinations of connection speed and pricing. I never know how much it will cost me to visit a page, but I always learn quickly if I would prefer something small or full-featured. There is just no way I can communicate that preference.</p>
<p>It would be great if my browser had a switch for this purpose, like Firefox&#8217;s &#8220;Work Offline&#8221; toggle. So if I switched to bandwidth saving mode, then every subsequent request to web server would communicate my preference with a HTTP header field like:</p>
<blockquote><p>X-Bandwidth: save</p></blockquote>
<p>In principle you could have multiple levels of bandwidth consumption, but that would likely be an overkill. Common practice suggests that at most two levels would really get used, one aimed at mobile devices and other at desktop.</p>
<p>Header like that might be enough, but even better would be if Javascript environment got another property describing current state of user&#8217;s preference (like say <em>navigator.bandwidth</em>). Coupled with a bandwidth event triggered on change you could really optimize every modern web page, even those with more complicated loading of resources and execution paths.</p>
<p>Right now such functionality doesn&#8217;t exist or at least I couldn&#8217;t find it (I even searched Mozilla&#8217;s bug database for any future plans). I think my proposal is both user and developer friendly and workable. If you can think of a reason why it would be problematic, then I would really like to hear it.</p>
<ol>
<li id="save-bandwidth-note-1">Pages are often personalized for visitor. Developer tools of different browsers also don&#8217;t report same sizes. They also report amount of data transferred not the size of that data once unpacked. Almost 2M of Twitter&#8217;s Javascript is thus reduced into page of &#8220;only&#8221; about 1MB of data transferred. And that to display couple of sentences.<a href="#save-bandwidth-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="save-bandwidth-note-2">Depends on browser used. Variation in sizes is probably due different formats of fonts used by browsers. It also changed once I published this post.<a href="#save-bandwidth-2">↩</a></li>
