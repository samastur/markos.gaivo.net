				<p>I added Google ads (again), but with a bit of a twist. They can be seen only on posts at least two months old, so they don&#8217;t annoy my few regular readers and are seen only by fly-by visitors, who&#8217;ll never return again. Since they are the same people who come to this site by searching for something, it&#8217;s also more likely that ads will be beneficial to them. So in a way we all win or at least nobody loses (much). If you think the idea sounds too good to be mine, well, you&#8217;re right. It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Jun/1/ads/#comments">Simon&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>I also admit to writing misleading title for this post. There are no connections between those three words or at least not in this article, but wouldn&#8217;t it be great, if all university students in Slovenia were required to write 3 new wikipedia articles in their final year? By then they should certainly be qualified and experienced enough to meet the level of your average wikipedia post and it wouldn&#8217;t add much to their workload.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=227" rel="bookmark">Google Gears Goodies</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>It&#8217;s an expected fact of a geek life that interesting technologies and gadgets appear when you don&#8217;t have either means or time to play with them. No surprise then that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html">Google Gears</a> was announced exactly at such a time for me. As you&#8217;ve probably read elsewhere, Google Gears is a browser extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer (with Safari coming up) which lets developers create web applications that can also run offline on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t the first company doing something like this. Adobe has Apollo, Microsoft is working on its own thing, Mozilla added support for offline storage in version 2 of the fox and there are some less well known attempts like Dojo&#8217;s. What makes it special are few things.</p>
<p>First, unlike Apollo or Firefox, it&#8217;s not a special environment and it&#8217;s as cross-browser and cross-platform as it gets these days. Google is also trying to build an industry support for this and Adobe already <a href="http://shebanation.com/2007/05/30/google-gears/">announced</a> it will support Gears API in Apollo. Same has <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/audible-ajax-episode-21-dojo-offline-on-google-gears">already been done</a> by Dojo Toolkit. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/05/30/19.06.10/#comments">an intention</a> to make it an open standard by submitting proposal to WHATWG/W3C (and hopefully them accepting it).</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t wait to play with WorkerPool API (which seems to be overlooked in all the excitement). Having a possibility of running time-intensive operations in a background without the fear of triggering &#8220;unresponsive script&#8221; dialog is a wish come true. Even though you can&#8217;t access objects <em>document</em> and <em>window</em> (and hence any part of the DOM). Reason for this is that background scripts don&#8217;t share any execution state and hence can&#8217;t all access unique objects like aforementioned ones.</p>
<p>This might limit usefulness of the API somewhat, but there are still plenty of uses that come to my mind. What also comes to my mind is a problem, that isn&#8217;t really technological. Web applications gave impression to public of being fairly safe to use even on public computers (which isn&#8217;t really true) and I fear many won&#8217;t understand that new tools may now store private data where they don&#8217;t expect or want them to.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=226" rel="bookmark">Standardized luggage sizes</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>It&#8217;s getting more and more horrible to travel around with planes. Senseless airport rules or those which benefit only airport employees can still get me angry even days after return home. These days I wouldn&#8217;t dare to change planes at Heathrow unless I had at least two hours to do so and would need at least 3 hours not to be nervous about it. Still, there&#8217;s a positive side to it. It makes coming through the home door a happier event.</p>
<p>Somehow I don&#8217;t mind the actual waiting at the airport. On our last trip we, my wife and I, waited several hours for our next flight which gave us ample time to sit in cafeterias and observe functioning of an airport.</p>
<p>We watched couple of men loading luggage on a plane and unsurprisingly they didn&#8217;t handle suitcases gently. Our fairly new samsonite is a witness that this is quite common and I don&#8217;t expect it to last for more than a few more years unless we reduce amount of traveling we do. Still, I was astonished to see how far they can throw big heavy suitcases. It certanly can&#8217;t be good for their backs.</p>
<p>Looking at flying luggage got me thinking. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if the whole process of loading and unloading bags could be mostly if not completely automated?</p>
<p>It could be done the same way as it was done with ship containers. Just standardize a few sizes in which all suitcases would come and build airplane cargo areas that take those sizes into an account. I believe you could handle most luggage completely automatically and use human gorillas only for pieces that don&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>You could also stimulate adoption with appropriate weight or pricing benefits for those who would use such luggage. This way we&#8217;d all win. Or is there something I&#8217;m missing?</p>
