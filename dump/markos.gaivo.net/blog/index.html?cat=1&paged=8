			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Yahoo recently <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/02/22/free-yui-hosting/">announced</a> free public hosting of YUI library, just like AOL <a href="http://blog.dojotoolkit.org/2006/01/30/dojo-iamalpha-and-cdns">did</a> a while ago for Dojo toolkit. A great move. You don&#8217;t have to pay bandwidth for hosting YUI and there&#8217;s a better likelihood that scripts will already be in visitors browser cache, since some other previously visited page might have used them too.</p>
<p>However there&#8217;s a real downside to it. What happens if Yahoo servers are unaccessible or connection to them is just slow?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, then its former and the page will be rendered quickly but with some (javascript) functionality missing. If later, then it might take forever to render a page since modern browsers can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t do it until all javascript has been loaded.</p>
<p>This might seem an unlikely scenario, unless you&#8217;ve been around the last time when access problems to Google Analytics stopped displaying a large part of slovenian web, least important of which being this very blog. Yahoo is not stupid, but neither is Google and problem can literally appear anywhere between their servers and your visitors computer.</p>
<p>So what can be done if this possibility is not acceptable to you, but you&#8217;d still want to use free hosting?</p>
<p>Nothing pretty it seems. The only thing that I can think of is to add local links to yui, put them together with Yahoo links at the bottom of the page and trigger Javascript when content has been loaded. Then you only have to wait for YUI objects to appear before you start processing your scripts.</p>
<p>This way you can probably avoid crippled or blank pages, but you&#8217;re still paying for the bandwidth. Unless of course you go one step further and include local links only when Yahoo objects don&#8217;t appear in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how to solve this problem gracefully?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll give <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jscript4/" title="Book's homepage">4th edition</a> of Javascript, the Definitive Guide by David Flanagan to person who emails me first.</p>
<p>The book is in excellent condition even though it&#8217;s been in my hands a lot and I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Javascript. I&#8217;d still cling to it, if I haven&#8217;t received 5th edition as Christmas gift.</p>
<p>Lucky recipient will be able to claim it at next <a href="http://web.zen.si/">Wednesday talk</a>, whenever it will be.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=209" rel="bookmark">Preventing download of javascript on mobile web</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Every year I spend a few weeks somewhere where internet connection is either slow or metered and expensive. Usually it&#8217;s both which makes me rather twitchy when it comes to big web page sizes. Yet I&#8217;m also certain that my new web home, however it may turn out at the end, will have a significant chunk of it written in Javascript. None of it necessary for working, but more than I&#8217;d probably like to download over flimsy mobile phone connection.</p>
<p>The problem are not really old mobile browsers which don&#8217;t support Javascript. They won&#8217;t download any of it anyway. The question is how to prevent eager browsers, who would, from downloading this stuff when you don&#8217;t want them to. My first, rather primitive attempt was <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/envcheck/index.html" title="Demo of javascript ondemand loading depending on media">this demonstration</a>, which only works in Opera 9, Safari and Firefox, but most certainly doesn&#8217;t work in all browsers.</p>
<p>What it does is check font size of a title and based on its value resolves which media style sheet was used. If it was <em>mobile.css</em>, which is used only when media is set to <em>handheld</em>, then it was probably done from a mobile environment, so it includes the mobile version of a Javascript or it could, if I wanted, none at all.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this approach. First one is that it doesn&#8217;t recognize notebook users connecting over a  cellphone. It can&#8217;t really, since browser environment is literally the same, unless it would try to measure latency and bandwidth of page elements and guess from those results, which is neither easy nor reliable. 3G networks can be rather fast and have a better latency than a wired connection from somewhere like Tanzania.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s say we don&#8217;t care about this case. We can always turn Javascript off in Firefox if it&#8217;s important enough to us, which leads us to the next problem. Support for handheld media type is still rather spotty. If browser doesn&#8217;t support it, it may load the wrong style sheet if any at all and the wrong CSS value results in wrong turn in Javascript. However <em>handheld media</em> support is getting better. Since I decided from the start that my personal page is a good place where leading edge can also be a bit of bleeding one, that is good enough. On a different site this probably wouldn&#8217;t be true.</p>
<p>So it sort of works in principle, but it is crude and error prone. Javascript check is not self-contained and I could easily break it by changing font size value of a title in CSS files while forgetting to do a corresponding correction in code. What would be much better is to learn from the browser which media types style sheets were actually used and act accordingly. Now that would be grand.</p>
<p>There are two ways you could go about this. My first go was finding style nodes in DOM and looking at their <em>disabled</em> property, which is commonly used in style sheet switchers for turning sheets on and off. It doesn&#8217;t work, since &#8216;wrong&#8217; media types in Firefox are ignored, not disabled. Their <em>disabled</em> value is still set to <em>false</em>.</p>
<p>A proper way of doing it would be using DOM Style Sheets methods. Basic idea is to compare actual values as set in the page with values read from style sheets and resolving which ones were used. While not exactly trivial, by little forethought it can be made to work fine in Opera and Firefox. It can also work in Explorer using its own methods, but it&#8217;s a pain to make it  work in Safari, which in this case is not only an incompetent liar, it&#8217;s also lying in some weird accent. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about it, then there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domstylesheets" title="Problems with DOM Style Sheets use">great</a> page describing current state but the gist of it is that you can&#8217;t rely on methods being there and even when they are, in some form or another, they might not work reliably (Safari) or might produce weird results (yup, Safari again).</p>
<p>Well, it could still work, but would require an unreasonable amount of code. Hence I made a different tradeoff, which can be seen <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/envcheck/index2.html" title="Second attempt">here</a>. A bit less automation for a lot less code. It keeps the idea of first demo with a small twist. First rule of every media style sheet targets the same element that gets created by Javascript if necessary and compares its font size value with those found in style sheets. It returns media types of all sheets where this value was found.</p>
<p>The end result certainly isn&#8217;t perfect or pretty, but it keeps amount of bookkeeping to minimum and limited to CSS files. Even using a &#8220;safe&#8221; property like font size can lead to problems (e.g. 0.9em is sometimes interpreted as 0.90em), but nothing difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>It might not be of production quality, but it will work as good starting point for further exploration.</p>
