			<div class="post-text">
				<p>These have been eventful couple of days for web developers. CSS Working Group chair <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2012/02/09/CALL-FOR-ACTION%3A-THE-OPEN-WEB-NEEDS-YOU-NOW">called on everyone </a>to use all (most?) vendor prefixes and stop making websites for WebKit which is becoming a new (mobile) IE6. Responses have been numerous, <a title="PPK's first article about prefixes" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/02/the_vendor_pref.html">including</a> <a title="PPK's follow up to first article" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/02/alpha_and_beta.html">ppk</a> who in his usual obnoxious manner <sup><a id="beta-prefix-1" href="#beta-prefix-note-1">[1]</a></sup> made some good points. Testing on mobile devices is an unsolved problem (who wants or can afford to buy so many almost immediately obsolete gadgets?) and introducing -beta- (maybe also -alpha-) prefix would simplify our lives while keeping most benefits of vendor prefixes.</p>
<p>I like -beta- idea and I think adding -alpha- might be even better. There&#8217;s still a problem of resolving syntax conflicts between different implementation which I think has a simple solution that closely mimics what browsers already do:</p>
<p><em>When parsing CSS browsers </em><em>should apply the last matching -beta-/-alpha- directive they fully understand.</em></p>
<p>Browsers already ignore directives they don&#8217;t understand and they apply last directive found when there are multiple candidates for a DOM node.</p>
<p>Such behavior would give us less CSS code to write and maintain, have predictable behavior and keep browser experimentation without favoring one. I have troubles finding negative sides of this approach, but do let me know if you can think of one.</p>
<ol>
<li id="beta-prefix-note-1">I deeply dislike his complaining about simplistic view of others while himself generalizing and name-calling (the lazy and stupid lot of us). Alas it&#8217;s not good to read only people you like and agree with.<a href="#beta-prefix-1">↩</a></li>
<li>Almost everything I write on this blog has an intended  audience of one:  me (no, really!). Why I sometimes write posts like  this, which don&#8217;t, is a mistery  since their expected and actual effect on anyone  is&#8230;none.</li>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been fiddling with my website again, changing theme switching from somewhat dumb class based system to a more proper one using alternate style sheets. I learned that picking a style sheet in browser applies those changes only to currently open page, so for style sheet selection to persevere it needs a bit of Javascript support from website owner. Personally I find this just stupid.</p>
<p>The easiest way to remember visitor&#8217;s preference is to store it in his browser. Cookies used to be popular before they were deemed evil, but they have other limitations as well. Hence popular switch to HTML5 in-browser storage technologies like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">localStorage</a>.</p>
<p>I think there is one important difference between cookies and tools like localStorage that is often overlooked and it&#8217;s not the size of data that can be stored. Cookies are sent with <em>each page request</em> while data stored elsewhere isn&#8217;t. Changing them on any side will automatically share state with the other. I use localStorage in my theme switcher because I think server doesn&#8217;t need and should not know which theme is used. But for storing shared data, especially one that expires, cookies remain a reasonable if not best choice.</p>
<p>None of this is exactly new, but I think it is worth remembering. In other news I dislike interface limitations of Chrome more and more (exceptions are Developer Tools and extensions framework).</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=865" rel="bookmark">Reading sources</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Google Reader was redesigned lately and I&#8217;ve been annoyed ever since. I had a dubious privilege of cutting and changing product features people loved in pursuit of <del>higher</del> different goals, so I try to be understanding when others do the same. I mostly found clumsy workarounds for removed features, but I do wish I could at least still trust that list of unread items actually has <em>all of them</em>. On a positive note I can save some electricity now because copious amounts of &#8220;helpfully&#8221; white whitespace illuminate this room brightly enough that you wouldn&#8217;t sit naked in-front of your computer even with lights turned off. That is if you are the sort of person who likes doing that but stops short of flashing your neighbors.</p>
<p>I still strongly dislike changes made, but I continue using Google Reader, because crack-heads don&#8217;t give up dope just because it was cut too thinly. I cherish my list of reading sources and like a gardener I have been cultivating it through years because I believe they make me better informed than I would be if I relied only on links shared by others. This may be elitist, but it is also true.</p>
<p>We are biased when choosing friends and communities we belong to. At the very least we enjoy our life more when surrounded with like minded people which is really a lighter shade of group think. We share to tell stories as much about what is shared as we do about who we are. Even when not self-censoring or trying to project an image we still are horribly bad at evaluating what influences us and how. Sharing everything, as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">this idiotic article</a> suggests, doesn&#8217;t fix this <sup><a id="reading-sources-1" href="#reading-sources-note-1">[1]</a></sup>. It&#8217;s still content from same people only more of it.</p>
<p>Then there are social new sites, which are in essence news organizations with bigger editorial board. Their focus might not be the same and their world view less obvious (or not) as of traditional boards, but the end result really isn&#8217;t all that different. I don&#8217;t dread waking up in a world without <a title="Apple's homepage" href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> as I do in one without  fish, but it is not articles about all things piscatorial that keep popping up on regular basis.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t make socially filtered news useless, just limited and best suited for finding out what is popular at this moment. They should be a side dish not the whole diet. Getting some of your information diet from social sources may improve it, but relying only on them is just stupid. I wouldn&#8217;t fret so much if I didn&#8217;t worry about development trends &#8212; latest Reader changes being one example of them.</p>
<p>Reader had two methods of sharing. Obvious one was button Share which was adequately replaced with sharing to <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a> circles. The other one, which was the one I actually relied on, was to create public feeds for articles marked with certain tags. The most important difference is that in first case you grouped by intended audience and in second by actual content <sup><a id="reading-sources-2" href="#reading-sources-note-2">[2]</a></sup>. Instead of following me, you could just follow my selection on particular topic which in most cases would probably be closer to what you want.</p>
<p>By itself stripping a feature like that doesn&#8217;t mean much. However when I also judge other changes such as aforementioned abundance of whitespace, removal of &#8220;Note to reader&#8221; and  new reading unfriendly theme, it&#8217;s easy to come to conclusion that all roads now lead to Google+. Reader&#8217;s role is at best to feed its younger brother with stuff to socialize around.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to attribute these changes simply to competition with Facebook since they are a part of a larger trend to social curation. I find this trend just a normal consequence of a web ecosystem where most product innovation happens in VC funded startups. How companies were funded was always a part of their DNA and economics of today&#8217;s VC environment for companies that will probably be acquired at some point (and let&#8217;s be honest, who REALLY believes most news experiments won&#8217;t be?) almost demands a quick and high growth. It&#8217;s not impossible to achieve this with sources-based product, but it&#8217;s certainly harder and less obvious than creating another twist on social news.</p>
<p>If my first and main point was a personal appeal to seek insight also in your own, personally picked sources, then my second is to question if shaping web and world with it should really be left only to industry and academia. It really doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.</p>
<ol>
<li id="reading-sources-note-1">Browser&#8217;s history is a great place to see just how much of what we visit is unimportant, unrepresentative and often unsharable. A small friction necessary for a deliberate act of sharing is actually a feature that gives at least a modicum of reflection on content&#8217;s share-worthiness.<a href="#reading-sources-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="reading-sources-note-2">Feeds enable that and are one of crucial building blocks for what I started to call <em>social software for introverts</em>.  It is software which is better when used by many, but is good even when  you are its only user. <a title="Tool for saving pages to read them later" href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> would be a perfect example of such an application and <a title="Evil empire" href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is a counter-example.<a href="#reading-sources-2">↩</a></li>
