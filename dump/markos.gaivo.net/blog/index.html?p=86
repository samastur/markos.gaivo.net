				<p>Jensen Harris posted an interesting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/11/29/497861.aspx">observation</a> few days ago regarding &#8220;help&#8221; in programs. Microsoft&#8217;s usability tests showed that help is mainly used by experts and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have data to back or refute his observations, but I did check our logs to see how often is our help accessed and the number is so low that I&#8217;ve seem to have talked about it with practically everyone who actually visited it. Sure enough, all of them belong to more experienced users who probably need it the least <sup><a href="#invhelp1-2005-12-04">1</a><a name="invhelp01-2005-12-04"></a></sup>.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s assume that Harris is correct and inexperienced users don&#8217;t access help. I think there are three basic questions you&#8217;re faced with when designing a help system <sup><a href="#invhelp2-2005-12-04">2</a><a name="invhelp02-2005-12-04"></a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you get users to discover and use help?</li>
<li>How do you meet the needs of those who do?</li>
<li>What about the rest?</li>
</ol>
<p>Harris&#8217; observation doesn&#8217;t change questions, but it does lead to possibly different answers.</p>
<h4>1. How do you get users to discover and use help?</h4>
<p>The least you can do is to make it accessible from a standard place, which is in the top right corner and to make it easily recognizable. If everyone says it&#8217;s Help, you should too and don&#8217;t hide it with small font size (we might be guilty of this) or inappropriate colors.</p>
<p>We tried to go further than this by also offering various means of help in close proximity to where we think our members might appreciate it. It&#8217;s still too early for any conclusive remarks, but compared to general use of our help, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s showing good promise.</p>
<h4>2. How do you meet the needs of those who do?</h4>
<p>If Harris is right and I believe he probably is, then this translates to what are the needs of experienced users and how to meet them?</p>
<p>What we have so far is simply a FAQ of real questions that have been asked previously. It&#8217;s amazing how many companies think FAQ is a place where they should put questions they&#8217;d like users to ask.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not much and certainly not enough, but there&#8217;s been little need for more so far. What I&#8217;d like to add is tips and other ways to deepen the knowledge of those, who&#8217;d like to do so, but so far we&#8217;ve lacked the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve certainly discovered that absence of tutorials teaching basic use of our service is not a problem. At least not so far.</p>
<h4>3. What about the rest?</h4>
<p>No matter how hard you work to make your product simple to use and how easy it is to get to help for it, there will be people who won&#8217;t know how to use it and either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t use help. How do you help them?</p>
<p>One way is to make mistakes really cheap. Everything that delays a successful completion of intended task is a burden, a price payed not in money, but in satisfaction. We&#8217;re trying really hard to make it as cheap as possible with lightning fast pages and non-destructive interfaces where it&#8217;s easy to fix mistakes.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s already clear that this approach works very well. I believe it&#8217;s partially responsible why our help section is rarely used.</p>
<p>There are options like tooltips, that we haven&#8217;t used yet. There are probably options we haven&#8217;t thought of. We&#8217;ll try new stuff and when we do, I&#8217;ll let you know what we&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="invhelp1-2005-12-04"></a>Before I go on I should point out that it would be nice to think that we got our interface right and most people don&#8217;t need to visit our help section. However, without data to back that up it could also mean help is just too difficult to find. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll have to investigate.<a href="#invhelp01-2005-12-04">&uarr;</a></li>
<li><a name="invhelp2-2005-12-04"></a>I assume that all conscientious designers strive for a design that would remove the need for help. I also recognize that this is often not possible.<a href="#invhelp02-2005-12-04">&uarr;</a></li>
