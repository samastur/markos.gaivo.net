		<description>Does everybody know they&#039;re invited to stay? Was that explicitely said to them and repeated before the start of each lecture? I wouldn&#039;t stay if I saw a group of acquaintances chatting privately among themselves.</description>

		<description>Precisely because there are people talking and it might be interesting to join? I don&#039;t know really.

I&#039;m doubtful about your idea though. First, I&#039;d want an informal setting, where you talk to whomever you want and not a panel like environment. Second, by the time you&#039;ve arranged them, they&#039;re gone anyway.

I think main problem is that we don&#039;t know each other and if you&#039;re introvert like me, it&#039;s damn hard to start talking to a stranger. So, the question becomes, how do we become acquainted?</description>

		<description>Why would they stay?
I think it didn&#039;t seem that anyone was interested in them staying. Regular geeks just started talking and kind of ignored everyone else. Maybe we could arrage seats in the end and invite people for a dabate?</description>
