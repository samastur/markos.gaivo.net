				<p>I was talking to my wife today about why an &#8220;Unknown Source&#8221; is becoming the most common source of visits on <a class="zem_slink" title="Flickr" rel="homepage" href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. My guess is that it is almost certainly because a <a class="zem_slink" title="HTTP referrer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer"><em>Referer</em></a> header field is missing in page requests and Flickr is only relying on presence of this piece of data to discern sources. This might have made sense when browsers ruled the web, but we don&#8217;t live then anymore.</p>
<p>Simply put referrer field <a title="Link to Referer field definition" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.36">can be added</a> to request only when request was triggered from source which also has an <a class="zem_slink" title="Uniform Resource Identifier" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a> address. Every web page has it since its address is also an URI, but most programs don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why referrers aren&#8217;t missing only from visitors using paranoid browsers or security software that stripped it out of requests, but also when page is visited from a link embedded in emails or instant messages.</p>
<p>Requests without referrers used to present a small enough subset of visits that most of us didn&#8217;t care. I first noticed this changing when Twitter clients became popular and now there are tons of apps behaving like this. With <a title="Link to specification" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/">XMLHttpRequest Level 2</a>﻿ even web developers will get a choice of making anonymous requests which won&#8217;t include potentially private data like referrers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nice. I have certainly visited places which I wouldn&#8217;t want to share with strangers. But I suspect this is not the common case and most of the time we don&#8217;t care telling which page or application sent us there.</p>
<p>Nobody can precisely predict future so specifications can never be perfect. But I am always amazed when reading core web specs like HTTP&#8217;s how insightful their authors were. That most programs don&#8217;t have a URI does not mean that they couldn&#8217;t. Practically anything can and definitely more things should.</p>
<p>In principle it is possible for each program to have its own address which could be used as referrer <em>when a better option doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. I suspect this would be against the spirit of specification, but likely not against its text.</p>
<p>However better options often do exist. Lets take <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> as a popular example. Every link that triggers a visit from Twitter was included in at least one tweet and every tweet is also published on web. It might not be accessible to everyone, but it does have an address. I see no reason why that address could not be used as referrer by Twitter clients.</p>
<p>It is originating content or its address that interest me, but really, almost anything truthful beats an unknown source. Just knowing name of the service (like Twitter) or app used (e.g. Tweetdeck) would be better than nothing. By the way there is another header field that could provide such insight: <em>User-Agent</em>. Sadly it is notoriously unreliable and often missing as well, but that&#8217;s another long story.</p>
<p>So, if I come back to Flickr. I can&#8217;t really tell how much Flickr can or could know. I suspect more than it tells, but I would be astonished if they are not mostly in the dark too. Web was largely built by people too busy (and often too lazy) not to cut corners. Meaning: learning and doing as little as possible to get something to work and sometimes we pay price for our ignorance. But it&#8217;s a small price compared to waiting for <a title="Description of project Xanadu on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a>.</p>
