			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I returned from <a class="zem_slink" title="Costa Rica" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a> two days ago after a month spent there. It&#8217;s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn&#8217;t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.</p>
<p>But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote <a title="Last year's review" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=534">my yearly review</a> and it&#8217;s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn&#8217;t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>&#8216;s product guy ended after several months and I still have mixed feelings about the whole thing. I haven&#8217;t finished much of what I started, exception being <a title="HTML Lint homepage" href="http://lint.brihten.com/html/">HTML Lint</a>, which was mostly <a title="Fry's homepage" href="http://fry.si/outbreak/">Fry&#8217;s</a> work anyway.</p>
<p>I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn&#8217;t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won&#8217;t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO<sub>2</sub> while travelling than last year.</p>
<p>I am more optimistic about next year. <a class="zem_slink" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">COP16</a> wasn&#8217;t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I&#8217;ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.</p>
<p>This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=608">plan</a> to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.</p>
<p>It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years&#8230;Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.</p>
<p>It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.</p>
<p>I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.</p>
<p>I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).</p>
<p>I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?<a class="zem_slink" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133">4 hour work week</a>, which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.</p>
<p>I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why <sup>[<a href="#book-1">1</a>]</sup> again draws no sympathy from me.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.What do I want?</p>
<p>I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like <a class="zem_slink" title="Pixel Qi" rel="homepage" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/">Pixel Qi</a> will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.</p>
<p>However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.</p>
<ol style="margin-top:3em">
<li id="book-1">You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.</li>
</ol>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=608" rel="bookmark">Sabbatical</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Aleš recently <a href="http://blog.spetic.si/2010/09/importance-of-sabbatical.html">wrote</a> about importance of <a class="zem_slink" title="Sabbatical" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical">sabbatical</a>. I could not agree more.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really regret much in my life, but I do regret not taking long vacations between jobs. The closest I got was taking two weeks off before coming to <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be even worse. I hardly spent any of my vacation time, probably in juvenile notion that it makes me (look) dedicated. It didn&#8217;t. However it did make me more tired, less useful and less happy.</p>
<p>We all have hobbies or projects we would love to do if only we could find time for them. If you don&#8217;t, you really ought to find something. I&#8217;ve never met a creative person interested in only one thing. Living for your job really sucks if it ends and someday it almost certainly will.</p>
<p>Sabbaticals are great because you have time to decompress from last job before throwing yourself into new one, to do at least some of that stuff you&#8217;ve been dying to do and to hopefully get a fresh perspective on where you are going.</p>
<p>I find traveling great for getting perspective. Things really do look different from distance and you should get as much of it as you can &#8211; in time and geography. I haven&#8217;t taken a sabbatical yet and it will probably be few more years before I do, but I do take a long vacation each year somewhere as different as possible from what I am used to.</p>
<p>Recommendation on what to see and do in <a class="zem_slink" title="Costa Rica" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a> are hence welcome.</p>
