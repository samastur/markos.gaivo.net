		<description>It used to be much worse than it is now. These days it&#039;s little quirks (bugs) that take most of my time.

I&#039;ve been thinking about this and what annoys me the most is that I don&#039;t think it could be otherwise. There are basically two choices.

Test new features in the wild and standardize those which survive. This way you may distill a good specification out of developers tears, sweat and blood.

Or you write a standard upfront before actually testing it in real life and risk getting a specification that is already obsolete when finished and awkward to use.

We are buggered either way.</description>

		<description>Aaaah the advent of standards nobody adheres too. Isn&#039;t it wonderfully how M$ and netscape screwed us all over with their proprietary &quot;idea&quot; of javascript, and now we have to live in webhell?</description>
