		<description>Since I sell luggage for a living this caught my eye. Actually, most luggage does fall into fairly standardized sizes based on either weight or dimensions. It&#039;s the devil in the details that causes problems, and passengers or airlines who try to take advantage of The System. What amazes me is how well The System actually does work, at least most of the time. Once again the great majority of bags do get to where they&#039;re supposed to be going and in relatively good condition. The problem is the horror stories are repeated so often that they appear far larger than they are. The bottom line is simple.
If passengers would read the rules and directions before they start packing or traveling, they wouldn&#039;t have problems. But they don&#039;t, so they do. Sigh....</description>

		<description>True, they would lose. But public debate involves people who get aggravated by those same procedures.

I&#039;d expect they would get even less sympathy than police.</description>

		<description>Even more people would loose their jobs?

I know it&#039;s bad argument, but still it is something that would come up in public debate around this.</description>
