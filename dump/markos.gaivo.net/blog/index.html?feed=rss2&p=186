		<description>I think we&#039;re in agreement on the libraries-made-obsolete by browsers point. The question I was answering (at least as I interpreted it) was &quot;what would you like to see with libraries in the future&quot; - my ideal world would be for libraries not to be necessary because the browser-provided API does everything you need it to, but I know full well that that&#039;s an unatainable dream. I guess I was really just trying to emphasize the point that libraries patch over the gaps in the browser-provided APIs (better support for animation, drag-n-drop, fixed event model etc).</description>
