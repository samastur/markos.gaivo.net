			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year&#8217;s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0">Charlie Brooker&#8217;s 2014 Wipe</a>. A must watch is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis">Adam Curtis&#8217;</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0#t=28m23s">segment</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov">Vladislav Surkov</a> (jump to 28:23 if it doesn&#8217;t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1199">became 40</a> in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.</p>
<p>My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.</p>
<p>Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with<sup><a id="review-2014-1" href="#review-2014-1-note">[1]</a></sup>. Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.</p>
<p>Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am <strong>not</strong> emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes<sup><a id="review-2014-2" href="#review-2014-2-note">[2]</a></sup>. Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.</p>
<p>Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.</p>
<p>I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and&#8230;), but I am becoming suspicious of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">quantified self</a> movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.</p>
<p>If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is. <a title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=664">Again</a>. However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.</p>
<p>In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.</p>
<p>I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have&#8221;finished&#8221; <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">mjp</a> against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery&#8217;s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.</p>
<p>My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.</p>
<p>Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I&#8217;m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.</p>
<p>I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.</p>
<p>I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.</p>
<p>My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.</p>
<p>I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.</p>
<p>It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can&#8217;t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing &#8220;reader&#8221; as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It <em>is</em> something to keep an eye on this year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.</p>
<p>I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don&#8217;t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).</p>
<p>All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best: <em>The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and The Quiet American</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smut-Stories-Alan-Bennett/dp/1250003164">Smut: Stories</a> by Alan Bennett. Sex is rarely as funny as in this two stories, but the second story kind of peters out as if the author ran out of ideas to resolve the twisted mess.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253/">Developing Backbone.js Applications</a> by Addy Osmani. A very good, but occasionally slightly dated introduction to framework. Still highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Handlebars-js-Gabriel-Manricks/dp/1783282657/">Instant Handlebars.js</a> by Gabriel Manricks. Cover says it all: short, fast and focused examination of Handlebars.js. Great if you prefer books to online reading.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Backbone-js-Cookbook-Vadim-Mirgorod/dp/1782162720/">Backbone.js Cookbook</a> by Vadim Mirgorod. A quick dive into Backbone.js best when paired with previous book on the topic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Vagrants-Novel-Yiyun-Li/dp/0812973348">The Vagrants</a> by Yiyun Li.</strong> A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can&#8217;t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp/dp/1482374811/">Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3</a> by Jeff Knupp. A short but informative collection of tips on how to write &#8220;pythonic&#8221; code. The only real downside is book&#8217;s price.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Andrew-Miller-ebook/dp/B0052RMN1U/">Pure</a> by Andrew Miller. Works best when establishing atmosphere of late 18th century Paris and easy engaging read that turned out to be a bit of disappointment for me. I wish author had as much courage as he does talent.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soldiers-Salamis-Javier-Cercas/dp/B00EBGKWB6">Soldiers of Salamis</a> by Javier Cercas.</strong> Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024">The Quiet American</a> by Graham Greene.</strong> I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn&#8217;t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">GEB</a> even if I discover that I don&#8217;t like it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="aligncenter"><img src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/ice_hotel.jpg" alt="Pole dancing room in Ice Hotel 2014" width="400" height="365" /></p>
<p>I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now <em>know</em> some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.</p>
<p>To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.</p>
<p>The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.</p>
<p>I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can&#8217;t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.</p>
<p>Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don&#8217;t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.</p>
<p>By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn&#8217;t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There&#8217;s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won&#8217;t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you <em>can</em> do, better. Which is what I am doing now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I meant more books from authors translated into English (so not &#8220;Anglo-saxon&#8221;). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less satisfying picks.</p>
<p>I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus 7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they were easily exportable and creating them wasn&#8217;t such a hassle.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. Bold is  reserved for those I found best: <em>This House, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Embers, River Town: Two Years on Yangtze, Chimerica, Decline and Fall</em> and <em>The Fall of the Stone City</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas</a> by Seymour Papert. A book  on constructivist approach to learning written for educators which for me was sometimes a bit of a challenge. Makes a persuasive case for at least a modified approach to learning (wasn&#8217;t won over completely) and did provide some intriguing possibilities for my work.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Peking-Murder-Englishwoman-Haunted/dp/0143121006">Midnight in Peking</a> by Paul French. Similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Suspicions-Mr-Whicher-Murder/dp/0747596484">The Suspicions of Mr. Whitcher</a>. A gripping, well researched story about an &#8220;unsolved&#8221; horrendous murder that vividly brings to life Peking long gone.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Modern-Plays-James-Graham/dp/1472507029">This House</a> by James Graham.</strong> Great and very funny drama about 1974 UK hung parliament that I wish I could see in theater.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X">The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</a> by William H. Whyte.</strong> I bought this book because I wanted to understand why some places in my neighborhood work so much better than others. The book is easy to read, short, but packed with useful information and I can&#8217;t recommend it enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Django-Testing-Debugging-Tracey-Karen/dp/1847197566">Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging</a> by Karen M. Tracey. Book has some flaws: 50$ price on Amazon, sometimes too much details, obsolete Django 1.1. Nevertheless I would recommend it since it does provide a very good and mostly still relevant introduction to this topic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Brother-His-Hakan-Lindquist/dp/3867870853">My Brother and His Brother</a> by Hakan Lindquist. A warm and sad love story about a boy discovering life and personality of brother he never knew. Recommended.</li>
<li><a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a> by Daniel Greenfeld, Audrey Roy. I read this book in alpha and beta form, but can nevertheless heartily recommend it to every Django developer. It gives you something to think about even when you disagree, but you&#8217;ll learn plenty too.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Embers-S%C3%A1ndor-M%C3%A1rai/dp/0375707425">Embers</a> by Sándor Márai.</strong> An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation (from Hungarian via German).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351">Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</a> by Steve McConnell. A must-read book on software estimation for every developer. I just wish it had more to say about challenges of estimation in agile environments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Uncommon-Reader-A-Novella/dp/0312427646">The Uncommon Reader</a> by Alan Bennett. A witty book about pleasures and downsides of reading. Good fun for bookworms.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Cups-Deceit-Humanitarian-ebook/dp/B004XHVOW4">Three Cups of Deceit</a> by Jon Krakauer. Investigative journalism at its best. Look at (mal)practice of Central Asia Institute and its founder. Unlikely to be interesting to those who&#8217;ve never heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024514.do">The Accessibility Handbook</a> by Katie Cunningham. This fairly short book has a few minor errors, but it is packed with information and should be required reading for every web developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do">Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization</a> by John Myles White. If you do A/B testing, but don&#8217;t know what bandit algorithms are, then this short, practical and well-written book will noticeably improve your work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Town-Two-Years-Yangtze/dp/0060953748/">River Town: Two Years on Yangtze</a> by Peter Hessler.</strong> A wonderfully alive and sensitive depiction of life in small China town that might change how you see China. Couldn&#8217;t put it down.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Misunderstanding-Irene-Nemirovsky/dp/0099563843/">The Misunderstanding</a> by Irene Nemirovsky. I completely disagree with the review on Amazon. This would be a very good book even if its author wasn&#8217;t 21 when she wrote it. Certainly not sentimental, but also not a overly judgemental look at life of a doomed affair.</li>
<li>PADI Open Water Diver Manual by . Lots of good information, but poorly organized with bunch of infomercial crap at the back. Still much better than cretinous videos and definitely helps to pass the exam.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radiance-King-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590174550">The Radiance of the King</a> by Camara Laye. If you have a literal sort of mind, then don&#8217;t skip Toni Morisson&#8217;s introduction. Beautifully written, still relevant and not completely understood by me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Criticism-Prickly-Paradigm/dp/0972819630">What Happened to Art Criticism</a> by James Elkins. Book that reads like listening to dinner polemic. Still insightful look into why modern art criticism satisfies few, but a bit evasive at times. Did not resolve my problems with modern art.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Porting-Python-3--depth-guide/dp/1456411519/">Porting to Python 3: An in-depth guide</a> by Lennart Regebro. An encouragingly short book on the topic that still feels complete. Made me want to make my code Python3 compatible.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0156027321">Life of Pi</a> by Yann Martel. Read it after I accidentally saw the movie which I surprisingly (to me at least) liked  a lot. The book and the movie are really two takes on the same story, both standing on their own, but I liked the movie a bit better. The book is much darker and not for the squeamish.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimerica-Lucy-Kirkwood/dp/1848423209/">Chimerica</a> by Lucy Kirkwood.</strong> I bought this book after I&#8217;ve seen this remarkable play and it is equally impactful when &#8220;just&#8221; read. Can&#8217;t recommend strongly enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Oberon-Modern-Niklas-Radstrom/dp/1840029285/">Monsters</a> by Niklas Radstrom. Short drama about unfathomable tragedy when children kill a child and the complicity of non-involvement we are guilty of.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926078/">Decline and Fall</a> by Evelyn Waugh.</strong> 85 years old satire of British society that is sadly relevant and very funny.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/">Testable Javascript</a> by Mark Ethan Trostler. A book with (I think) slightly incorrect title. I wish ratio between explaining how to test Javascript and how to set up environment was more in favor of the former, but still good book to read on the subject.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Stone-City-Ismail-Kadare/dp/0802120687">The Fall of the Stone City</a> by Ismail Kadare.</strong> Complex and rich tale of power, dictatorship and integrity. Just read it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Charlie-Hill/dp/1781251630">Books</a> by Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author&#8217;s view (which I do).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raising-Steam-Discworld-novel-Novels/dp/0857522272/">Raising Steam</a> by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).</li>
</ol>
<p>This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really like to build a couple of things I&#8217;ve been postponing for years now. Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.</p>
<p>A year that started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz’s</a> death and ended with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">Nelson Mandela’s</a> never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.</p>
<p>In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at <a href="http://aptivate.org/">Aptivate</a> and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am *not* an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.</p>
<p>I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra">Socotra</a> sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.</p>
<p>What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.</p>
<p>List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).</p>
<p>Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with <a href="https://github.com/samastur">my Github history</a> and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.</p>
<p>Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.</p>
<p>I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.</p>
<p>What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.</p>
<p>This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of <a href="https://twitter.com/trepca">Sebastjan</a>’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.</p>
<p>I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.</p>
<p>Instead of building tools like <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">mjp</a> or <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet">image-diet</a> I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.</p>
<p>Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.</p>
<p>I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.</p>
<p>My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.</p>
<p>I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">set things right</a>. No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I&#8217;ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:</p>
<p><em>Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?</em><br />
You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-1" href="#avoid-stupid-1-note">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?</em><br />
Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?</p>
<p><em>Why am I trying to say this?</em><br />
Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.</p>
<p><em>Is it a matter of a principle or degree?</em><br />
I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-2" href="#avoid-stupid-2-note">[2]</a>.</sup></p>
<p><em>Can I be persuaded?</em><br />
I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always run through all these questions, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.</p>
<ol>
<li id="avoid-stupid-1-note">Or as Upton Sinclair put it: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” <a href="#avoid-stupid-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="avoid-stupid-2-note">Example: unrealistic view of humanity makes communism and libertarianism equally absurd. <a href="#avoid-stupid-2">↩</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Like <a title="Comments closed" href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2013/07/comments_closed/">Tomaž</a> I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.</p>
<p>Regretfully I don&#8217;t have time to build this and it wouldn&#8217;t scale (I&#8217;m curious why Akismet doesn&#8217;t do something like that). So following Tomaž&#8217;s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don&#8217;t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I write here I mostly do it for me and I mean that in an almost literal sense. My readers were quiet and few. They were also mostly Google Reader users or at least that&#8217;s how I imagined them. I certainly was.</p>
<p>Greader&#8217;s shutdown meant forgotten accounts would be wiped out together with ghostly presence of their long gone owners. Those still around would be looking for a new reading home and may have seen this as a good time for late spring feed pruning.</p>
<p>I wanted to say good bye before they did, but got my timing horribly wrong. Delayed too long until server running this website died. By the time it was up again, Greader wasn&#8217;t anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get to the station too late. The train has left and goodbyes remain unsaid. But then I remember I never actually knew if anybody would be on that train. So nothing really changed.</p>
