		<description>I&#039;d say that is about right. We brainstormed ideas together and Fry also helped bring in a few presenters. Organizing talks was certainly easier with his help. But I don&#039;t think I was exactly hogging credits. I thought that by linking to their pages I made it clear that Fry and Davorin are really the ones who deserve it.
wwwh today certainly is a different event than when it started. I certainly expected that because it was the reason why Fry took over. I simply felt that change of direction was needed for wwwh to succeed and that I was not the right person to do it. Other more specialized events give me much of what I sought, but wwwh is still a great place to get everyone together and I wish more would see it as such.
These new lectures sound interesting. Is there a place where we can find out more?</description>

		<description>6 years... how time flies.

btw: what I remember was that an important part of getting wwwh off the ground was connecting you and Fry. So fry gets credits too as he played a role from very beginning. I am not quite sure, but I think you wanted someone to help you before you accepted the leading role. Have I mixed things up or is this right?

Great things happen with good seeds :). But I wouldn&#039;t mind reducing amount of beer and increasing the level of content at wwwh.

Anyway, while we are at it... This year we are starting monthly lectures at FRI &quot;Do gležnjev v blatu&quot; where industry and start-ups will be presenting serious/deep technology to academic and student audience. Stuff that&#039;s trendy and hopefully useful, but not really being studied and lectured currently in the Ljubljana CS studies.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t remember knowing that but what I really had in mind was that we didn&#039;t really force visitors to sign their name in logbook so counting those who did doesn&#039;t provide reliable number.

Still, great to hear that numbers exist and that they look quite positive.</description>

		<description>You know that since 2006 we are sort of collecting visitor numbers for Web hours at Kiberpipa.

Year #eventes #visitors
2009 	34 	721
2010 	36 	825
2011 	30 	623

And since you used to have access to our event manager its not hard for you to get to full numbers.</description>
