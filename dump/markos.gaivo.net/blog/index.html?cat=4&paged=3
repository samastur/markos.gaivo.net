			<div class="post-text">
				<p>These have been eventful couple of days for web developers. CSS Working Group chair <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2012/02/09/CALL-FOR-ACTION%3A-THE-OPEN-WEB-NEEDS-YOU-NOW">called on everyone </a>to use all (most?) vendor prefixes and stop making websites for WebKit which is becoming a new (mobile) IE6. Responses have been numerous, <a title="PPK's first article about prefixes" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/02/the_vendor_pref.html">including</a> <a title="PPK's follow up to first article" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/02/alpha_and_beta.html">ppk</a> who in his usual obnoxious manner <sup><a id="beta-prefix-1" href="#beta-prefix-note-1">[1]</a></sup> made some good points. Testing on mobile devices is an unsolved problem (who wants or can afford to buy so many almost immediately obsolete gadgets?) and introducing -beta- (maybe also -alpha-) prefix would simplify our lives while keeping most benefits of vendor prefixes.</p>
<p>I like -beta- idea and I think adding -alpha- might be even better. There&#8217;s still a problem of resolving syntax conflicts between different implementation which I think has a simple solution that closely mimics what browsers already do:</p>
<p><em>When parsing CSS browsers </em><em>should apply the last matching -beta-/-alpha- directive they fully understand.</em></p>
<p>Browsers already ignore directives they don&#8217;t understand and they apply last directive found when there are multiple candidates for a DOM node.</p>
<p>Such behavior would give us less CSS code to write and maintain, have predictable behavior and keep browser experimentation without favoring one. I have troubles finding negative sides of this approach, but do let me know if you can think of one.</p>
<ol>
<li id="beta-prefix-note-1">I deeply dislike his complaining about simplistic view of others while himself generalizing and name-calling (the lazy and stupid lot of us). Alas it&#8217;s not good to read only people you like and agree with.<a href="#beta-prefix-1">↩</a></li>
<li>Almost everything I write on this blog has an intended  audience of one:  me (no, really!). Why I sometimes write posts like  this, which don&#8217;t, is a mistery  since their expected and actual effect on anyone  is&#8230;none.</li>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=918" rel="bookmark">On Tumblr</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p><strong>Warning: </strong>this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.</p>
<p>I started using <a title="Description of IRC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.</p>
<p>I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and a <a title="Definition of neologism" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism">neologism</a> that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.</p>
<p>I never heard of something like that related to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.</p>
<p>However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a <a title="Ulysses - an example of such work" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29">Joyce-like stream of consciousness</a>. I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.</p>
<p>The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff <em>and</em> really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.</p>
<p>Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=898" rel="bookmark">Cookies, localStorage and shared state</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been fiddling with my website again, changing theme switching from somewhat dumb class based system to a more proper one using alternate style sheets. I learned that picking a style sheet in browser applies those changes only to currently open page, so for style sheet selection to persevere it needs a bit of Javascript support from website owner. Personally I find this just stupid.</p>
<p>The easiest way to remember visitor&#8217;s preference is to store it in his browser. Cookies used to be popular before they were deemed evil, but they have other limitations as well. Hence popular switch to HTML5 in-browser storage technologies like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">localStorage</a>.</p>
<p>I think there is one important difference between cookies and tools like localStorage that is often overlooked and it&#8217;s not the size of data that can be stored. Cookies are sent with <em>each page request</em> while data stored elsewhere isn&#8217;t. Changing them on any side will automatically share state with the other. I use localStorage in my theme switcher because I think server doesn&#8217;t need and should not know which theme is used. But for storing shared data, especially one that expires, cookies remain a reasonable if not best choice.</p>
<p>None of this is exactly new, but I think it is worth remembering. In other news I dislike interface limitations of Chrome more and more (exceptions are Developer Tools and extensions framework).</p>
