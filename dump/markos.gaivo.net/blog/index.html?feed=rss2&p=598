		<description>Markos, I completely agree Facebook Connect allows for a smaller less established site to gain that all important &quot;trust factor&quot;.
MNels, great point about giving an incentive to people who sign up for a full membership. I guess the trick is to offer an incentive so good it would make someone think twice before signing up through Facebook Connect.</description>

		<description>Facebook should be recognized as an opportunity to reach the masses for one&#039;s particular site however, I agree to make it more enticing to sign up for one&#039;s site an incentive to become a &quot;full member&quot; is a step in the right direction. While it&#039;s true that those on FB don&#039;t particularly like signing up for all site&#039;s that come their way, an incentive will make them look twice and at least consider it. Just a thought.</description>

		<description>My personal opinion here is that facebook authentication is actually more intrusive at least for me - I don&#039;t feel comfortable sharing my FB profile with just about everyone... there should be some segmentation created so that the user can manage who sees what. My 2 cents.</description>

		<description>I guess it can encourage more people to sign up. It is then up to us to build the deeper trust moving forward. Once that is achieve users are more likely to do further transactions.</description>

		<description>@Markos - good point regarding the &#039;Trust&#039; aspect, I certainly agree with that as I too would be far more likely to go through Facebook rather than initially directly.</description>

		<description>Good point and thank you for comment.

I would argue that this is true only if value you gain from that marketing is greater than value you lose from people who left, but otherwise wouldn&#039;t.

What Facebook Connect is for visitors is trust by proxy. I might not trust you enough, but I do Facebook to enter. Hence strong brands have less to gain from it than weaker.

I guess at the end, like with so many other things, it depends on particular case (website).</description>

		<description>Hi Marko,

This is an interesting conundrum you raise. While Facebook integration does make it easy for people to &quot;sign up&quot; to certain websites, the website owner does not get that user&#039;s registration details which is important in terms of keeping them informed of site updates, marketing messages etc.

You said: &quot;If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?&quot;

I would probably argue that yes it does matter from an income point of view because then Amazon have lost out on potentially two months worth of marketing opportunities. If you are an avid customer of Amazon, they could have sold you a lot more products!
