			<div class="post-text">
				<p>As I am leaving on a short vacation that will probably take me off grid for few days, there is still a time for a hopefully short, but definitely last post of this year. I don&#8217;t like how registration forms ask me twice for password and I think I can offer a better way.</p>
<p>Most registration forms these days still want you to type password of your choice twice. They probably do it to reduce risk of mistyping it. I deeply dislike Facebook, but I think this is one thing it <a title="Registration form on Facebook's homepage" href="http://www.facebook.com/">got right</a>. You only have to do it once. Those with FB accounts can see this in action if they log out for a moment and visit front page.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why once is enough. First one is that every decent page provides a way to reset password in case you have forgotten it. So even if password was mistyped, it&#8217;s easy to reset it again to a different value. Second reason is that by now it&#8217;s quite well known that most people use a low single-digit number of passwords and don&#8217;t come up with a new one each time they are asked to do so. Hence it&#8217;s quite unlikely they&#8217;ll make an error now after so much practice.</p>
<p>Third reason is that in most cases you can <a title="Demonstration of show password switch" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html">help them</a><a style="font-size: 29.25px; line-height: 42.75px;" title="Demonstration of show password switch" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/onepass.html"></a>.</p>
<p>When registration forms first appeared internet access was rare and expensive enough that most common environment in which it was used was work or school. It was therefore likely that when you were registering for a service, you weren&#8217;t alone and entered password had to be hidden from people around you. Today it&#8217;s probably opposite. Most of the time I am quite private and could see what I type with no additional security risk.</p>
<p>So as in demo we could offer a switch that let visitors see what they are typing if they choose to do so. It should still be hidden by default, since we can&#8217;t really tell the environment visitor is in or if Javascript is available. It is always better to err on side of safety.</p>
<p>As a side note for those who might have peaked at implementation. I&#8217;m replacing password input field because of Internet Explorer, which doesn&#8217;t tolerate type attribute change on input fields. Every other browser tested (FF, Opera, Safari and Chrome) would work perfectly fine by just switching field type from password to text.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that&#8217;s it for this year. If you leave a comment, which I hope you will, and I don&#8217;t answer, it&#8217;s because I lack Internet access.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There&#8217;s an HTML pattern that has been bugging me for a while even though I&#8217;m guilty of using it too. It&#8217;s even present on page you are reading right now.</p>
<p>Almost every page has a navigation bar and chances are that strip is presented as some kind of a list of links. Just as it should be. What bothers me is that when you actually are on page listed in navigation, its navigation item will <a title="An example of this pattern" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">still contain</a> a link to it.</p>
<p>This reference to itself is like having a door in a room which leads you back in. Not very useful and certainly misleading.</p>
<p>Better approach is to simply not have a link when that link would point to page itself. Such HTML is also more semantic, since it&#8217;s clear which item was selected and where we are even without a style sheet.</p>
<p>When discussing this observation it was pointed out to me that with proliferation of Javascript and AJAX you might want to give your visitors a way to bring a page to a known state by reloading it. I think this is more than adequately solved by reload button that every browser has and most users know, but if you find having a link a better solution, why not try a compromise. Just add the missing link with Javascript in spirit of <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/link.html">this demo</a>.</p>
<p>This way you won&#8217;t polute content markup with behavior that should sit on top of it.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Fry <a title="Link to mentione post" href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/2008/08/15/discovering-greasemonkey-again/">published</a> few neat <a title="Greasemonkey home" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> scripts recently and since I am also a fan of this Firefox <a class="zem_slink" title="Add-on (Mozilla)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add-on_%28Mozilla%29">extension</a>, I thought I might share one myself. It&#8217;s a script I am using right now, while I am typing this post.</p>
<p>Script hides everything but editor on &#8220;Create New Post&#8221; page in <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. It also adds a toggle to the right which you can use to control visibility of hidden parts.</p>
<p>I did this because I don&#8217;t want to be distracted when I am writing and close-to-empty page helps me stay focused. If you&#8217;re like me, then please <a href="markos.gaivo.net/examples/lovelywp.user.js">download</a> the script.</p>
