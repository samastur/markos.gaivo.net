				<p><a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2006/04/26/23.23.02/">This</a> brought a sad smile to my face.</p>
<p>There was a time when Javascript implementation in Internet Explorer was really top notch and other browsers had something to look up to (apart from memory leaking, which is just embarrassing). But it&#8217;s been 5 years since last IE and it will take almost another year to release version 7, which won&#8217;t bring any Javascript related changes (apart from native XMLHTTPRequest). I see myself as language minimalist, but <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/09/09/23.05.56/">there are</a> things that I&#8217;d love to see implemented.</p>
<p>However, IE is not the only thing developed with glacial speeds. Even though there&#8217;s talk of CSS3, we only received (another?) working draft of CSS 2.1 a couple of weeks ago. So, as many are not aware, even CSS 2.1 hasn&#8217;t seen a final release yet even though it&#8217;s been widely used for a while now.</p>
<p>Slow development pace does have certain benefits. We get more time to learn and master new stuff and what we learned doesn&#8217;t age as quickly as it would otherwise. But when limits of what you have rub you the wrong way, it can be quite depressing to calculate how long it will take to remedy this. Especially if you&#8217;re bound not only to development of a technology, but also to its deployment. Thank &lt;some deity&gt; this is not an issue for me with Python 2.5.</p>
<p>In the line of work that I do, I can pretty much forget anything in development which needs browser support, since it won&#8217;t be deployed widely enough in this decade. I don&#8217;t, since I&#8217;m a geek, but I could as there&#8217;s little I can do with it and there&#8217;s a whole history of great promises that didn&#8217;t make it in the end.</p>
<p>It does, however, pose an interesting question without an answer. When should I start learning something new?</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=153" rel="bookmark">Python on series 60</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I knew it exists, but I haven&#8217;t looked into <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/python">Python on series 60</a> until yesterday and I wish I did so sooner. My mind is just flooded with ideas of what to do and I can easily see myself wasting lots of time playing with it. I do wish it was possible to build stand-alone applications, which wouldn&#8217;t require a separate installation of Python. As such I believe series 60 Python is more or less limited to prototyping and personal use.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing that is a problem for an old goat like me (over 30 and loving it). It&#8217;s a pain in the ass to type anything substantial on mobile phone and although some new phones (like Nokia N70) have predictive dictionary for my language, lots of them including mine don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I do have an idea on how to tackle this problem. Most of us have a vocabulary of few thousand words (unlike Shakespeare, who I&#8217;m told used 36 thousand of them), but we only use few hundred of them in our everyday life. Therefore if my text input heavy applications would continuously build a dictionary of words typed by user, they would fairly soon get a usable predictive dictionary for this particular user.</p>
<p>There are downsides. You start with nothing and there&#8217;s a problem of how to build  a dictionary without annoying. You could tackle this by staying in learn-only mode until your dictionary-hit ratio rises above some threshold (80-90%?).</p>
<p>There are also pluses. You get a dictionary that&#8217;s much better fitted to your user than a generic one, since it actually has words he uses. That is if I&#8217;m not underestimating dictionaries used in modern mobiles.</p>
<p>What would make it even better is if such dictionary would be standardized so any application could use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update: I was wrong, you </strong><strong><a href="http://www.mobilenin.com/pys60/info_standalone_application.htm">can</a></strong><strong> make a completely stand-alone application in Python. Sweet.<br />
</strong></p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=144" rel="bookmark">Updated sgmllib</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=142">wrote</a> about a sgmllib problem a few days ago. I still may be a dolt and my code certainly needed fixing, but the bug remained nevertheless.</p>
<p>Hence I&#8217;ve made some small changes to sgmllib that fix problems I&#8217;ve had. New version, which passes all unit tests included in Python distribution, can be found <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/sgmllib/sgmllib.py" title="fixed sgmllib.py">here</a> and I&#8217;d really appreciate if users of sgmllib could give it a go (that includes users of htmllib and BeautifulSoup).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As suggested I&#8217;ve added an <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/sgmllib/test_sgmllib.py" title="Test cases for new library">updated version</a> of test_sgmllib.py, which includes an example where the old library fails and new one doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: It <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=142#comment-1120">seems</a> this is valid, even required SGML behavior.</p>
