		<description>No single person can change the world alone.

Each one of us can help spreading the conciousness about the state of the world and educating people on what actions to take to make things slightly better. One small step at a time.

Once the conciousness spreads to sufficent number of people, things will turn for the better. But yes, right now I share the same feeling with you ... when that happens, there&#039;ll only be about 100M people still alive on this planet x.x</description>

		<description>I have to say this was a pleasurable year of working with you at Zemanta!

Oh, and you can look at the bright side too: economy crushing means closing of the factories means less polution. Also it seems that Obama&#039;s New deal is going to revolve around green tech, which seems a good sign.

But yeah, we have though challenges ahead - both economic and environmental.</description>
