				<p>Q: How can you tell that you&#8217;re at tech conference?</p>
<p>A: The line in front of men&#8217;s toilets is longer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media 2006</a> has finished. It was great and I specially enjoyed presentations given by <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">Nate Koechley</a> and <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a>. Those two alone made going worthwhile and if you have a chance to see any of them, don&#8217;t miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>The conference was much bigger this year, which is one thing I didn&#8217;t like. It was harder to find people you were looking for and even if you did find them, they were usually already occupied by somebody else. If you&#8217;re an introverted guy like me and not a natural orator, then it can be a bit difficult to make the most of the time you have. I didn&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m glad I finally met <a href="http://www.clagnut.com/">Richard</a>, who&#8217;s an even nicer guy in real life.<br />
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span>A quick summary of sessions I attended:<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer</a> talked about last 10 years of CSS. An interesting talk, but for me even more important, he explained to me why <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=122">margin collapsing</a> wasn&#8217;t a daft idea.</li>
<li>I went to a design panel with <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon Hicks</a>, <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php">Veerle Pieters</a> and <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron Moll</a>, since I know a thing or two about Javascript, but I&#8217;m completely design illiterate, which this blog can only attest to. I can&#8217;t say how designers liked it, but it was certainly very educational for me. I knew I choose my colors as if I was colorblind, but I also discovered I need to learn more about grids.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a> gave a nice rundown of the state of web typography and pros and cons of different methods and Andy Budd entertainingly as always presented tricks and approaches to tackling browser bugs. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html">Jeffrey Veen</a> talked about Web 2.0 and new applications and although he made quite a lot of good points, I&#8217;m not sure openness wins every time. My counter example would be instant messaging, where GTalk hasn&#8217;t changed the field much. I hope I&#8217;m wrong and this will change in the future.</li>
<li>Day two started with <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm&#8217;s</a> interesting presentation, where I again learned a trick or two. I especially enjoyed the way to build scalable arrows using CSS.</li>
<li>Dan&#8217;s talk was followed with Javascript panel. Personally, I think the idea of centralized hosting of Javascript libraries to improve caching doesn&#8217;t make much sense. If nothing else you bet that your visitors will also be able to access your caching sites which might not always be true. It certainly isn&#8217;t in this part of the world, where partial break-downs are not all that uncommon. Still, the panel probably deserves its own post.</li>
<li>Cameron Moll also gave a presentation on the state of mobile web design. It wasn&#8217;t bad, but I hoped for more.</li>
<li>Nate Koechley&#8217;s talk was a revelation. An incredible amount of good information and it&#8217;s been eye opening for me to learn about Yahoo&#8217;s experience. Scary that they build an internet explorer emulating layer for Yahoo Mail though (why didn&#8217;t they just drop the original code and start over?).</li>
<li>I enjoyed last year&#8217;s session with Andy Clarke, so I decided to attend this years as well and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Andy&#8217;s work for quite some time now and I&#8217;m definitely buying his book when it comes out. So should you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this is it. I hope to be there again next year.</p>
