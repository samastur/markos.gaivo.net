			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=313" rel="bookmark">IE6 &#8211; hope of web standards</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I often find myself in a room with web developers and at least one of them proclaiming that IE6 sucks because it doesn&#8217;t support web standards while others nod in agreement.</p>
<p>This has bothered me enough to contemplate having a talk at <a href="http://www.barcamp.si/">BarCamp Ljubljana</a>. I didn&#8217;t, but this is what I would say.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 6" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</a> was released on 27th August 2001, when twin towers were still standing in NY.</p>
<p>7 years is a long time to remember, but what did we work with back then? There was no <a class="zem_slink" title="Safari (web browser)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and Firefox was still in its infacy, far from 1.0 release coming 3 years later. It was changing so often most developers simply ignored it. Opera was at version 5 (version 6 came out in November of that year) and I am sure I am not alone in remembering how awful it was at least until version 7 in 2003. <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla" rel="homepage" href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> was at version 0.6 and although showing great promise, IE6 definitely was the browser we hoped others would match.</p>
<p>Back then no browser supported CSS2 in a meaningful capacity. Opera had the best support for CSS until then, but IE6 surpassed it. It didn&#8217;t support DOM Level 2, which was standardized only 4 months before first beta of IE6. Good excuse not available anymore to <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 7" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">IE7</a> and IE8. Apart from that it supported more or less everything web developer could want back then and then some. IE6 problem isn&#8217;t so much that it didn&#8217;t support standards of its time as it is that it doesn&#8217;t support standards of today.</p>
<p>So why the hostility?</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Lancia Delta" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta">Lancia Delta Integrale</a>, which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don&#8217;t hear them go around complaining how it doesn&#8217;t meet standards of todays cars.</p>
<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve said, 7 years is a long time and most web developers are not old gits like me, so the historic context isn&#8217;t there. We also have to live with its real shortcomings today. But I think there&#8217;s more to this.</p>
<p>Complaining about IE6 standards deficiencies is declaring who you are and where you stand. It&#8217;s a simple and very recognizable way of declaring you are a member of web-standards tribe. IE6 bitching has at least as much to do with proclaimer as with proclamation&#8217;s subject. Trashing IE6 isn&#8217;t so much talking about the browser as it is talking about you.</p>
<p>However it is not unreasonable to ask why IE6 doesn&#8217;t better support standards that were released or updated after its initial release.</p>
<p>Certainly more could be done through software updates, but are standards themselves forward looking in a way that would avoid updating browser internals with every new version of a particular standard?</p>
<p>I am quite certain that this isn&#8217;t always possible. I don&#8217;t see how you could add a video object from <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML 5" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5">HTML5</a> to a browser without explicit support from browser&#8217;s developers. But not all changes are such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5">John Allsopp</a> has recently pointed out.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about HTML5. It&#8217;s bringing much needed new capabilities and lots of goodies, but I also think <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/15/Grandiosity">Sam Ruby</a> has a point. New, simple, <a class="zem_slink" title="Document Type Declaration" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration">DOCTYPE</a> is reduced to a switch between standards and <a class="zem_slink" title="Quirks mode" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode">quirks mode</a> and unless it will become more complicated in later revisions, it won&#8217;t offer an easy way to distinguish between HTML5 documents and other HTML versions. This isn&#8217;t a particular problem if newer revisions will be backwards compatible with older, but this isn&#8217;t true even of HTML5. Why would we think this is the last version where we will make a major misstep that needs backwards-incompatible correction?</p>
<p>There are other things I don&#8217;t like about HTML5, but if I would have to pick one thing I would like to see changed, is to make it more extendable.</p>
<p>To sum it up, IE6 is indeed a problem in todays development, but it&#8217;s also at least at fault for this. It was an excellent browser when it came out and is remarkably solid one for software so old. There are many reasons, completely untouched in this post, why its users don&#8217;t migrate to something newer, but we, web developers, are also to blame, because we tend to standardize only current practice and leave few doors open for future development which invariably comes.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There&#8217;s an HTML pattern that has been bugging me for a while even though I&#8217;m guilty of using it too. It&#8217;s even present on page you are reading right now.</p>
<p>Almost every page has a navigation bar and chances are that strip is presented as some kind of a list of links. Just as it should be. What bothers me is that when you actually are on page listed in navigation, its navigation item will <a title="An example of this pattern" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">still contain</a> a link to it.</p>
<p>This reference to itself is like having a door in a room which leads you back in. Not very useful and certainly misleading.</p>
<p>Better approach is to simply not have a link when that link would point to page itself. Such HTML is also more semantic, since it&#8217;s clear which item was selected and where we are even without a style sheet.</p>
<p>When discussing this observation it was pointed out to me that with proliferation of Javascript and AJAX you might want to give your visitors a way to bring a page to a known state by reloading it. I think this is more than adequately solved by reload button that every browser has and most users know, but if you find having a link a better solution, why not try a compromise. Just add the missing link with Javascript in spirit of <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/link.html">this demo</a>.</p>
<p>This way you won&#8217;t polute content markup with behavior that should sit on top of it.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=296" rel="bookmark">Tweaking pages</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked <a title="John's homepage" href="http://john.jubjubs.net/">John Lily</a> why haven&#8217;t they integrated <a class="zem_slink" title="Greasemonkey" rel="homepage" href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> into <a class="zem_slink" title="Firefox" rel="homepage" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. Wrong question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know was:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla" rel="homepage" href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> integrate Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It&#8217;s them who decide how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.</p>
<p>Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone&#8217;s computer and belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)  to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;To whom does a browser belong to?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation doesn&#8217;t need to be. I find <a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">Platypus extension</a> a good first step to how a browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even further to their needs.</p>
<p>I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I&#8217;m failing to find anything substantial.</p>
