		<description>I think blind people are going to require help when they buy drugs.  What happens if you&#039;re trying to buy the above product and instead you buy laxatives?

I think a more useful tool would be scanning allowing blind people to scan RFID tags attached to each product and then using text-to-speech technology for identification.

This would be a fairly expensive system to implement, but there is already motivation for the stores to use RFID tags.  Custom boxes would probably be seen as an unnecessary expense.</description>
