				<p>I was recently discussing how I think all code, especially mine, is crap and since this position has been and likely still is controversial, it might not be a bad idea to discuss it a bit more. This likely won&#8217;t avoid grievances and disputes, but it might save me some work in explaining myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never written a non-trivial amount of code that I wouldn&#8217;t find at least a bit embarrassing two years later. Partly because of my own deficiencies as a programmer, partly because our craft evolves and does so rather speedily. Even if I was as good a programmer as I would like to be, our profession would still develop and my code would eventually become crap. It would just take a bit longer than it does now. In a way, with maybe few exceptions, all code <em>left alone</em> is on natural trajectory to a state of crappiness.</p>
<p>Personally I don&#8217;t find this insulting. If anything I would be terrified to discover that my old code doesn&#8217;t bug me at all. I would see it as a signal that I haven&#8217;t developed my craft much in this time. <strong>You haven&#8217;t peaked until you stagnated</strong>.</p>
<p>There are also other benefits to this position. Since I find my code at least a bit dubious, I&#8217;m not enamored with it to the point, where I would find it difficult to ditch it if need be. It helps me being more detached and rational about its merits or lack thereof.</p>
<p>In contrast with what I just said, it also helps me from scraping it too soon. Accepting that some level of crappiness is a given, I don&#8217;t feel as much need in reformatting, refactoring or rewriting code that offends my sensibilities. I like reading pretty or even inspirational code as much as the next programmer, but esthetics are not too important. As long as code is functional, bug-scarce, maintainable and generally usable enough, it&#8217;s also pretty enough.</p>
<p>So if you happen to hear me insensitively remarking that some code is crap, please try to keep in mind that my completely universal belief means it&#8217;s not meant to be personal or even negative. I likely regard your code and skill higher than mine. I am truly sorry, if you nevertheless feel bad about it.</p>
