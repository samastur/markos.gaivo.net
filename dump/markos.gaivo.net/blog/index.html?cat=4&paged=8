			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Now that Mini Seedcamp in Ljubljana is behind me (an event that might warrant its own post), I finally have some time to write about <a href="http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/FrontPage">Open Hack 2009</a>. I&#8217;m sorry to say to those who didn&#8217;t go that this might have been the biggest mistake you&#8217;ll do this year. It was indeed awesome. Before I go on I would also like to thank people at Yahoo for really pulling no stops in making it great and to everyone who came, for being inspiring, helpful and generally fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> and I made two hacks, a website <a href="http://guesswhatthisis.appspot.com/">GuessWhatThisIs</a> based on an idea we brought to event (but no code), and a game <a href="http://friedcell.net/geopong/">GeoPong</a> that Fry thought of in wee hours of Sunday. GeoPong, best described as &#8220;<a title="Link to quote" href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/05/11/open-hack-london-2009-my-presentation-and-quick-review/">a quite irrelevant but lovely hack</a>&#8220;, doesn&#8217;t always work great (especially on non-FF browsers), nevertheless I am still amazed that we managed to build both, because we essentially did GuessWhatThisIs twice. Wifi didn&#8217;t work until later in the evening, so we built first version of the site with pieces of software we had on our machines an educated guess about APIs we needed but couldn&#8217;t access.</p>
<p>Event was thoroughly documented on Flickr, Twitter and plethora of other websites, so I won&#8217;t dwell much on that. Instead I&#8217;ll mention couple of observations that albeit not new, I still found interesting.</p>
<p>First one is that team is absolutely everything. You can certainly do interesting stuff alone, but things really start happening if you have a good team. Working with talented and fun people mean ideas get fleshed out sooner, there&#8217;s little coordination and more things get done. If on top they are like Fry, who like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell_Bunny">Duracell Bunny</a> just seems to keep going, you can finish projects you certainly would not otherwise.</p>
<p>Hackday also provided another proof that all-nighters as development method are an idiotic idea. Most hackers, who certainly didn&#8217;t lack enthusiasm, fell asleep at some point during the night and those, like us, who didn&#8217;t, slowly fried our brains. Development slowed down to a glacial speed, code written was frankly embarassing and help was needed to resolve most basic problems. We spent more than 4 hours on GeoPong which normally shouldn&#8217;t take us more than half of one. Even worse from efficiency point of view was that Monday was gone too. All-nighter can be a fun thing to do once in a while, but it is really a crappy way to run a business.</p>
<p>At the end a small advice to organizers for next European event, on which I hope we won&#8217;t have to wait another two years. Try putting as much documentation and libraries on USB key as you can, so in case of wifi not working, we can still program with them instead of falling back to what we already intimately know or have on our machines.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I recently read <a class="zem_slink" title="Raph Koster" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Koster">Raph Koster</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1932111972">Theory of Fun for Game Design</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1932111972" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, which I can heartily recommend to anyone interested in what games are all about. But it&#8217;s this part on page 88 that really got my attention, since I can relate it to what I do:</p>
<blockquote><p>Games are not stories. It is interesting to make the comparison, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.</li>
<li>Games are good at <a class="zem_slink" title="Objectification" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification">objectification</a>. Stories are good at empathy.</li>
<li>Games tend to quantize, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.</li>
<li>Games are external &#8212; they are about people&#8217;s actions. Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal &#8212; they are about people&#8217;s emotions and thoughts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot has been said in last couple of years about <a class="zem_slink" title="Game mechanic" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanic">game mechanics</a> and how its principles could be successfully used to make our websites more engaging and fun. Game-like without necessary becoming games. Still more should be said to penetrate consciousness of wider web industry.</p>
<p>But should all websites incorporate devices like collecting points or customization?</p>
<p>Probably not. Well thought through website has its purpose which usually means it wants to provoke action on visitor&#8217;s part. Intended action may be almost anything apart from abandoning site immediately. It may be buying at least an item on a commerce site, leaving a comment or subscribe to blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about above comparisons for days and it would suggest to me that principles of game mechanics are more appropriate for and easier to add to sites that can reasonably aim for prolonged interaction with a visitor.</p>
<p>E.g. a personal blog like this one is visited mostly by google-by visitors. Comments and other engagement devices might increase its pull, but game mechanics obviously plays second fiddle to a good story, told through its content and web design (both sorely lacking on this particular blog). Same is true for most brochure-ware sites.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon" rel="homepage" href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> presents other side of spectrum. It is visited mostly by people who aren&#8217;t there to read an item description and leave, but are at least somewhat open to interaction with the site. As such it makes sense to incorporate more elements that can keep visitors engaged, such as easy rating of items, reviews etc. Same goes for most web applications.</p>
<p>I believe that most websites could successfully apply at least some elements from games, but like with everything else they shouldn&#8217;t be used too liberally and without understanding. Keeping in mind websites purpose and listed differences between a game and a story can help you make a more informed decision on what and when to include.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I just read <a class="zem_slink" title="Douglas Crockford" rel="homepage" href="http://crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devel-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596517742" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. It&#8217;s what a technical book should be. Concise yet full of useful information as a result of clear scope and sticking to it. If my experience is anything to go by, then there are not many Javascript programmers who wouldn&#8217;t benefit from it.</p>
<p>I did found one bit that wasn&#8217;t quite right. On pages 91-92 Douglas discusses <em>string.split</em> method, which can take a regular expression as a separator with which to split string. Douglas rightly points out that if regular expression includes capturing group (stuff between paranthesis like <em>b(mmm)c</em>), then strings matching those groups will be included in the split.</p>
<p>However Douglas is not completely correct when he says that some implementations drop empty strings in the output array when separator is regular expression. If you run <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/jssplit/index.html">this demo</a> in <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla Firefox 3" rel="homepage" href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox3</a> and IE7, you&#8217;ll see that IE7 drops even non-empty strings from capturing groups, while Firefox3 includes them.</p>
<p>Still, I would find a bug in my code faster this week if I read his book sooner.</p>
