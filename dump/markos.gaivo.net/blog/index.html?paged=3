			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.</p>
<p>I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">set things right</a>. No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I&#8217;ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:</p>
<p><em>Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?</em><br />
You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-1" href="#avoid-stupid-1-note">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?</em><br />
Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?</p>
<p><em>Why am I trying to say this?</em><br />
Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.</p>
<p><em>Is it a matter of a principle or degree?</em><br />
I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-2" href="#avoid-stupid-2-note">[2]</a>.</sup></p>
<p><em>Can I be persuaded?</em><br />
I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always run through all these questions, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Tickets are now <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">on sale</a> and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).</p>
<p>I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.</p>
<p>There is no good way of contacting organizers<sup><a id="djangocon2014-1" href="#djangocon2014-note-1">[1]</a></sup> and not much travel information either on <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">the DjangoCon&#8217;s website</a> or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don&#8217;t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.</p>
<p>First transport. It is not organizer&#8217;s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).</p>
<p>It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap<strong>er</strong>, but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.</p>
<p>No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.</p>
<p>In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!</p>
<p>I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.</p>
<p>There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn&#8217;t and it won&#8217;t.</p>

				<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Like <a title="Comments closed" href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2013/07/comments_closed/">Tomaž</a> I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.</p>
<p>Regretfully I don&#8217;t have time to build this and it wouldn&#8217;t scale (I&#8217;m curious why Akismet doesn&#8217;t do something like that). So following Tomaž&#8217;s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don&#8217;t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.</p>
