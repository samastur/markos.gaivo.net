		<description>I have realized this for a while, but I have been thinking about it from  a different perspective.  I have been thinking about what I want from a mobile/cell phone.

features:
1) phone book
2) caller ID
3) text messaging
4) bluetooth

design:
1) small size
2) sturdy build
3) long battery life
4) good audio quality
5) good reception

Pretty much every phone out there covers all of the features I am interested in except bluetooth.  Bluetooth isn&#039;t something I have ever used, but I do think I would like to synchronize my contacts with my computer wirelessly, so this is a feature I would use.

I think my &quot;design&quot; requirements show where cell phones are weak.  My cell phone often disconnect while I am talking in my apartment.  I have to stand near the window to avoid this.  Even if I am standing outside, the audio quality is still poor.  I suspect that this has to do with both the quality of the signal being sent over the air as well as the tiny, crappy speaker used to reproduce the audio.  Battery life isn&#039;t too much of a problem unless you actually use your phone.  Then the battery life drops substantially.

My final requirement is that I want a phone that does ONLY what I require.  I don&#039;t want a phone/mp3 player/camera/pda/gps/fashion accessory.  I want a phone.  Nobody seems interested in selling what I want.  I suppose profit margins are higher when you sell hip, trendy crap instead of good products.</description>
