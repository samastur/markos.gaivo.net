		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1262"><![CDATA[<p>Another year&#8217;s over. When squinting eyes a bit it looked very similar to 2013. The world remains an awful place which is getting better in many ways, but largely not in those I find most important. Specifics are better covered in a grimly entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0">Charlie Brooker&#8217;s 2014 Wipe</a>. A must watch is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis">Adam Curtis&#8217;</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EoNsGHZD0#t=28m23s">segment</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov">Vladislav Surkov</a> (jump to 28:23 if it doesn&#8217;t automatically). It may be the most horrifying thing I learned last year.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1199">became 40</a> in 2014. One thing I did not fully appreciate as a child when thinking about growing old is how big of a deal it becomes that people around you are getting older too. We were lucky and new health scares remained just that, for now. They are becoming more common and a good year may just be one where they all turn out to be false alarms or, at worst, manageable afflictions.</p>
<p>My year was not bad. We travelled and experienced a lot. I learned a lot, mainly about programming because I worked too much. I did not find much time to read books, write or even think about non-work related things except when on vacation. More skilled, but unlikely wiser. I often need to stay still to move forward, so while it was fun and necessary in many ways I do not want to repeat last year.</p>
<p>Yet I am not the same person I was a year ago. For one, I stopped fancying myself a rationalist. Logic should be used often, but not to identify with<sup><a id="review-2014-1" href="#review-2014-1-note">[1]</a></sup>. Doing so would (did?) ossify my thinking and limit what I can hope to understand and solve.</p>
<p>Last year I realised how little does missing my goals spoil my happiness. In 2014 I did almost nothing I planned but still was mostly happy which really brings up a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>First what constitutes the unmeasured dark matter of my life? Mostly my relationships and the well-being of people I love. Neither are really gaugeable beyond qualitative one-sided assessments because I am <strong>not</strong> emotionally stunted enough to survey my loved ones. Even an astute observer rarely notices more       than relationship’s phase shifts and has a limited ability to       influence the outcomes<sup><a id="review-2014-2" href="#review-2014-2-note">[2]</a></sup>. Limited does not mean no ability and while I try to do better, measuring anything feels elusive and counter-productive.</p>
<p>Still, there are limits to such joy. Even domestic bliss could not make working at abattoir palatable.</p>
<p>I have been tracking my weight for more than a decade (and books read and&#8230;), but I am becoming suspicious of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">quantified self</a> movement. Its focus on quantitative measurements works best when tracking physiological parameters like weight. Psychological ones? Not so much. There is always a danger of searching for key under a street lamp by improving measurable things instead of those that matter. Also, slicing life into trackable slivers can lead to normative behaviour even without gamified dashboards. Healthier and optimally busy automaton is still only an automaton.</p>
<p>If this sounds like crisis of faith from a self-improvement nut, it sort of is. <a title="Article about why goals can inhibit good reading" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=664">Again</a>. However, I still believe I am a co-author of what I will become and that not all outcomes are equally worthy. So I keep experimenting.</p>
<p>In 2014 I stopped doing digital sabbaths because of work overload. This year I definitely plan to get back to them, as I do to mentoring. I may scratch the digital part because it has the wrong focus (is reading on Kindle meaningfully different to reading on paper?), but I do want to find time again for things that get squeezed out otherwise.</p>
<p>I did not start any new personal projects. Instead I have&#8221;finished&#8221; <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">mjp</a> against my plans. What made it worse was that afterwards I stopped working on projects where I could use it. Still, reimplementing a meaningful subset of jQuery&#8217;s API is interesting, enlightening and good exercise for any web front-end developer.</p>
<p>My work journal, which I stopped writing when I ended up with no working computers, is currently on hold. I will continue writing it once I find a tool that makes it easier and figure out what to record (and how) so it will be useful later.</p>
<p>Monthly reminders of my plans were still largely intentionally ignored, but I&#8217;m keeping them even if their main effect is to instil a sense of well-earned guilt. They also help me turn down propositions more often than I would otherwise (but not often enough). To them I am adding a practice of weekly reflection (something I learned in Uganda from an ever-impressive Nodumo) which I intend to channel into very short lists of achievable plans for upcoming week. So far I wrote two of them with mixed results.</p>
<p>I have not read many books, but I have read a lot of which surprisingly little stayed with me. Difficult to say why, but my hypothesis is that I read too much brain candy (interesting stuff without lasting value) and do it without proper thematic focus.</p>
<p>I am certain that mixing reading subjects is a form of multitasking that inhibits learning. Therefore I plan to separate directed learning from reading I do for fun and general education. Tiny Tiny RSS (my feed reader) regretfully does not support such use and workarounds (multiple accounts) are too tedious to be realistic.</p>
<p>My approach of picking books by whatever I fancied at the moment is a questionable strategy when I can read so few of them. Instead, I will be doing semi-planned reading with a must-read list of carefully chosen books that will be short enough to leave room for few unplanned ones. I will also be keeping the freedom to decide my reading order.</p>
<p>I typed a lot, but wrote little. While these pages do not contain a representative selection of my thoughts, how much I publish is still directly proportional to how much of deepened thinking I do. I did not publish much in 2014. No idea on how to change this beyond hoping weekly sabbath will provide some time and focus.</p>
<p>It is time for me to learn a new programming language, but it will not happen before the second part of 2015. As much as Haskel is inviting for its mind-stretching abilities, I want it to be more directly useful to me. If I can&#8217;t use the language on a concrete project, than it is not likely to stay with me. With still ample time to decide I am oscillating between Rust and Go. First one looks more interesting, but is also definitely less mature and supported by local development community. Go on the other hand might be too pragmatic and timid to really learn something new.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to expect from this year. I ended last one even heavier than I started. Hopefully 2015 will continue with the new positively negative trend. I will continue to be too busy for a while, but wish to wrap up existing obligations and bureaucratic annoyances by spring. This year will be a definite failure if I do not start implementing &#8220;reader&#8221; as I have learned what I needed to begin and there are no valid excuses any more. My main challenge will be figuring out how to make progress without becoming an absent workaholic zombie. If I could salvage summer, which for me is a general waste of time when little gets done, then that would be a great leap towards this goal. On a lighter note, my horological impulse was also more pronounced last year, but I did not end up with many new watches. It <em>is</em> something to keep an eye on this year.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1254"><![CDATA[<p>As expected I read less this year than usual. Much less even, only 10 books. It was a very busy year, but this was still at the lower bound of what I expected. I intend to look at reasons why in my year review post which should be up early next year.</p>
<p>I am fairly satisfied by the mix of work-related and pleasure reading even if I failed to read anything substantial in Slovenian this year (started The Trial by Franz Kafka which I don&#8217;t expect to finish in few hours that are left of this year).</p>
<p>All non-fiction books were read on my tablet as was The Quiet American which I downloaded once I ran out of books in Vietnam. Reading on tablets did not improve noticeably this year and I still would not recommend it, but they are handy. I think e-ink readers did get to the point where they offer the best of both worlds and I am seriously reconsidering them. However I loathe DRM so I do not expect to buy e-only copy of books I care about any time soon.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine (which is all of them this year). Bold is reserved for those I found best: <em>The Vagrants, Soldiers of Salamis and The Quiet American</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smut-Stories-Alan-Bennett/dp/1250003164">Smut: Stories</a> by Alan Bennett. Sex is rarely as funny as in this two stories, but the second story kind of peters out as if the author ran out of ideas to resolve the twisted mess.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253/">Developing Backbone.js Applications</a> by Addy Osmani. A very good, but occasionally slightly dated introduction to framework. Still highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Handlebars-js-Gabriel-Manricks/dp/1783282657/">Instant Handlebars.js</a> by Gabriel Manricks. Cover says it all: short, fast and focused examination of Handlebars.js. Great if you prefer books to online reading.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Backbone-js-Cookbook-Vadim-Mirgorod/dp/1782162720/">Backbone.js Cookbook</a> by Vadim Mirgorod. A quick dive into Backbone.js best when paired with previous book on the topic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Vagrants-Novel-Yiyun-Li/dp/0812973348">The Vagrants</a> by Yiyun Li.</strong> A mesmerising and very depressing portrait of oppression in post cultural revolution China and its effect on people that I can&#8217;t recommend highly enough. Rarely hopeful, often unpredictable and always well written.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp/dp/1482374811/">Writing Idiotmatic Python 3.3</a> by Jeff Knupp. A short but informative collection of tips on how to write &#8220;pythonic&#8221; code. The only real downside is book&#8217;s price.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Andrew-Miller-ebook/dp/B0052RMN1U/">Pure</a> by Andrew Miller. Works best when establishing atmosphere of late 18th century Paris and easy engaging read that turned out to be a bit of disappointment for me. I wish author had as much courage as he does talent.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soldiers-Salamis-Javier-Cercas/dp/B00EBGKWB6">Soldiers of Salamis</a> by Javier Cercas.</strong> Undoubtedly the best book I read this year. An intelligent, compassionate and humane chronicle of a quest to uncover truth behind a myth from the end of Spanish civil war. I dare you not to be moved.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas. Of no use to those who are not programmers and should be required reading for those who are. I am not sold on all views and suggestions, but it has already influenced my work profoundly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0143039024">The Quiet American</a> by Graham Greene.</strong> I downloaded this one when I ran out of books in Vietnam and decided to do the cliche thing. Greene is a writer for those who prefer thrillers with a bit more literary ambition and this one doesn&#8217;t disappoint either. Gripping, well written and even prophetic considering it was finished a decade before USA got to experience all the things it warned it about.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have big plans for 2015 so to read 20+ books sounds lovely, but not achievable. Instead I will aim for 15, preferably of some heft and avoid fluff except when on vacation. For a change I also have a very specific goal which is to finally finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">GEB</a> even if I discover that I don&#8217;t like it.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1203"><![CDATA[<p>Disappointed I stopped using Twitter at the end of 2011 and have since visited it mostly to follow up specific references. As a medium I found it lacking but ignorable until recently. While I was reading about the aptly named <a href="http://imgur.com/a/nUX1A">Jacobinghazi affair</a> I felt the urge to tweet and pronounce Twitter as possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/samastur/status/476707986006880256">more toxic than Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>This article has been provoked by <a href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/">Tomaž&#8217;s</a> polite disagreement and is my late attempt to explain what I couldn’t on Twitter.</p>
<h2>My objections</h2>
<p>Leon Wieseltier recently described Twitter as <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118125/leon-wieseltier-responds-alain-de-bottons-attack-twitter">a place of infinite discharge of emotion and promotion</a> where nothing intellectually or linguistically substantial can be accomplished. It is a great and true enough description of Twitter.</p>
<p>Over the years a number of articles have discussed effects of new media on society in its largest sense. While I am interested in those my comment was mainly about Twitter’s role in shaping how individuals and communities think, communicate and behave.</p>
<p>In blogging heyday I thoroughly disliked celebration of rapid exchange of half-baked ideas. Making them smaller and exchange more rapid is not an improvement. Ideas have always been cheap and plentiful when untested and inspiring to the unwitting. Twitter is vast and there may be much worth reading, but chances are most of what you will read will be soon forgotten fluff. Creating on a medium like Twitter is hard since most things worth saying can’t be clearly expressed in 140 characters, nuance is valued even less than continuity and every good tweet can be buried in a pile of inane responses.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I originally stopped using Twitter was realisation that I found tweets from a fair number of otherwise congenial and intelligent people regularly off-putting. Twitter did not suddenly found their previously hidden depravity, instead its forced brevity of semi-public discourse made a great deal of it sound like movie informants wearing a wire. It is a great demonstration of how dialogue changes when we think others are listening and an insidious tool for normalising blanket snooping, much of it our own.</p>
<p>Research has shown that our brains keep adapting to their use and improving one skill often leads to deterioration of another or as McLuhan put it: “Every extension is also an amputation.” I lost count of people describing their difficulty with reading longer, more slowly developing articles after an expectation of instant gratification has been built by a steady diet of short ones. It doesn’t get more instant than a tweet and Twitter’s interface is optimised for non-discriminative reading of a never ending stream of tweets.<sup><a id="twitter-toxic-1" href="#twitter-toxic-1-note">[1]</a></sup> Can this really be good for a thinking person?</p>
<p>My tweet which led to this piece was provoked by an absolutely absurd argument closely matching Alan Jacob’s description of <a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2013/12/twitter-at-its-worst.html">Twitter at its worst</a>. Maybe worst, but certainly not rare. Of course arguments with all the negative baggage are not exclusive to Twitter, but Twitter does seem a more emotive medium than most of them. Discussions on Twitter are commonly a sad sight because it isn’t built for dialog. It is a marketing machine and works best when used as such.<sup><a id="twitter-toxic-2" href="#twitter-toxic-2-note">[2]</a></sup> Unsurprisingly millions of its users conform to its design hints by sharing content or less obviously with signalling group membership by snarking and sloganeering at sometimes only imagined opposition.</p>
<p>Ian Danskin’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTUW-owa2w">“This is Phil Fish”</a> video essay<sup><a id="twitter-toxic-3" href="#twitter-toxic-3-note">[3]</a></sup> about the nature of online fame recently made rounds and I can’t recommend it enough. Fame can appear without being sought and the longer it lasts, the more likely it is that the famous will become a stand-in for a concept to which public often responds negatively. This is especially unpleasant and difficult to deal with when the negative concept is tied not to what you did, but who you are or are perceived to be.</p>
<p>On Twitter (as previously noted) tweets may be written with a recipient in mind, but can be seen by anyone so all of them contribute to our public image without it being in our control.<sup><a id="twitter-toxic-4" href="#twitter-toxic-4-note">[4]</a></sup> Controlling tweets comprehension and propagation by relying on cultural norms to differentiate audiences does not work because those norms may not be well known and are certainly not accepted by everyone.</p>
<p>We speak when we want to pass on an idea. Amplifying ideas of others can be worthy, but we are more enriched when new ideas are created and explored. The really interesting ones can be controversial, rough and in need of a nurturing environment in which to develop. Twitter is not that place.</p>
<p>Mobbing and repression of unpopular opinion happens almost everywhere where opinions can be expressed, but the immediacy, ease of response and pay-off make Twitter particularly popular with trolls, sociopaths and anybody willing to goad their followers into collective sectarian hysteria. There will always be enough of them willing to tweet before thinking to pummel into silence everyone but the most determined. Only ideas at first protected by obscurity can develop and flourish in environment without boundaries.</p>
<h2>Three pillars of Twitter design</h2>
<p>Twitter earns money by showing ads. There’s another reason to be careful with any ad-based business beyond worrying about their usually insatiable hunger for our privacy. Its value is proportional to the amount of our time it captures.<sup><a id="twitter-toxic-5" href="#twitter-toxic-5-note">[5]</a></sup> Seeing ads on a site you frequent should trigger an examination of how much time you are willing to spend there.</p>
<p>I disliked Twitter’s design until I realised that its main purposes are spreading messages and increasing its use. It does those two things splendidly and kudos to Twitter’s designers.</p>
<p>I am obviously not privy to any internal information, but to me the foundation of Twitter’s design are three main values: terseness, immediacy and broadcasting.</p>
<p>Terseness is of course the well known restriction of 140 characters per tweet because of a technical limitation which does not really exist any more. Its effect on writing however remains because writing thoughts longer than 140 characters is awkward and will in newest-tweets-first Twitter applications always result in a broken reading experience. It is ill-suited for human dialogue because we don’t express ourselves at tweet lengths and we don’t hear responses first. Life is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> and it is not a coincidence that most messaging applications put newest messages at the bottom.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t Twitter raise the limit? I can only speculate, but I believe there are other benefits to Twitter beyond the limit’s role in Twitter’s brand. Longer text simply requires more effort from writer and readers and makes the platform less engaging thus hurting both of the stated Twitter’s goals.</p>
<p>Twitter does not use time much as a design tool beyond a core belief that real time is the right time to deliver a message and that delivered messages should be displayed in the opposite order they were sent which at some point will practically guarantee broken narratives and constant change of topic.</p>
<p>Most of us can’t effectively multitask because we can’t quickly switch contexts. We cognitively suffer when we try and reading tweets from unconnected authors in order in which they came is really just multitasking at high speed. There is no reason to believe that we listen as well and care as much as we would if our focus would not be constantly drawn to the next thing. Ability to listen fully and steadily is a difficult skill to develop, but quick to atrophy on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter may tolerate a moderate use of its platform, but certainly does not want it. It will keep suggesting new people to follow no matter how many you already do to keep the stream of tweets from ever drying up. Without them you don’t have a reason to constantly check your phone for new tweets and fewer reasons to post your own.</p>
<p>The other face of broadcasting is building up your audience which is how you’ll eventually see your followers once you get enough of them to not know many. And ever so helpful Twitter is here to get you to this point as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>First it provides a crude privacy model in which either everything is private or nothing is (ignoring direct messages that are irrelevant for this article). This not so gentle nudge to make output public is further supported by ubiquitous leader boards tracking followers, retweets and favourites, constantly reminding us of everyone’s standing and relying on our vanity to improve it. None of these would need to be so prominent if what really mattered was sharing and chatting with your friends. Putting a scorecard on our every utterance makes sense only if its most important feature is their popularity.</p>
<p>Hoarding followers and followees has another negative effect beside making already described ones worse. For historical reasons and because of web app limitations twitterers often use just one account, so subscribing to it conflates all author&#8217;s interests into one stream and while not merging different communities, it certainly exposes them more without them having much say in it. This, together with stilted expression, reduced comprehension and empathy, on a platform that promotes making an instant idiot of yourself in pursuit of recognition is, in my opinion, an important contributing factor to many heated arguments.</p>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of issues I have with Twitter, not even important ones (e.g. obtuseness of relying on any one source for important information). Much of what I said is not unique to this service but a lot of it feels more excessive here. What makes it different is the platform&#8217;s growing presence and influence in our society by its successful co-opting of promoters in us. Doubtless there is a lot of good that happens on Twitter or because of it, but the platform is also bringing out the worst in us and I find its damaging effects more substantial.</p>
<p>Writing this article reminded me of a larger point I have not made before or not often enough. Technology is not morally neutral or unipolar let alone inherently positive and it frustrates me that discussions often try to cast it thus. As a practising technologist I am obviously not a Luddite, but neither do I assume that everything I am able to make is good even when made with best intentions. Our creations shape what we do, how we do it and even who we are and should therefore be critically examined for what they do for and to us.</p>
<p>As tools transform us and our societies I find pining for previous times unproductive, but I do not subscribe to technological determinism. We used freons for decades, but were perfectly capable of finding suitable replacements when we realised that our fridges would eventually fry us. But we did have to first realise and accept that.</p>
<p>* The title of this post was borrowed from the already linked article written by Leon Wieseltier.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1199"><![CDATA[<p class="aligncenter"><img src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/ice_hotel.jpg" alt="Pole dancing room in Ice Hotel 2014" width="400" height="365" /></p>
<p>I became 40 while I was sleeping on a slab of ice, which could be seen as a reminder of things to come when I am hopefully at least twice as old. I used to think 40 is the age where you finally need to give up on the idea of being young and that this would make it an important milestone for me. It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>My birthday trip is coming to an end and with it my conscious effort of figuring out what it means to be 40. So far it looks exactly like late thirties. Of course I am growing older. My health is still fine and I can do what I did at 20, except I now <em>know</em> some of the problems I will have if I live long enough. Wounds heal more slowly and muscles hurt a day later than before.</p>
<p>To actually see and feel the changes I need to compare myself with me at a platypus age of 30. 20 year olds are getting younger and finally look as young to me as I do old to them. I am not confused anymore about how my age is perceived. Greyer head and deeper lines on my face took care of that, but physical changes are not yet important.</p>
<p>The biggest difference for me was changing my priorities. My work is still important to me, but not as important as people I love. I will never be my father, but I am finally becoming more like my memory of him.</p>
<p>I have heard it many times, but rarely observed, that getting a child betters a man by giving him something more important than himself. My wife has done that for me and latching on to her was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I can&#8217;t think of a positive change in me or my life that happened without her help.</p>
<p>Changed focus does not mean that my ambitions have become smaller, but I am fine with not achieving most of them. Wanting approval, let alone seeking recognition beyond my intimate circle now also seems silly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a direct parallel between my development as a developer and as a person. I don&#8217;t feel inept anymore, but the more I learn, the less important most issues and technologies become. However remaining important ones I likely see even as more important than before. Everyone should feel strongly about something.</p>
<p>By this age most of us will discover that a lot of the stuff we didn&#8217;t want to believe when we were younger is nevertheless true and that we are not as special as we hoped or even thought. There&#8217;s a new found freedom when you stop beating yourself for things you won&#8217;t be or do and that freedom can then be used to do the things, that you <em>can</em> do, better. Which is what I am doing now.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1189"><![CDATA[<p>My plan for 2013 was to read more foreign literature which I guess I did since I read no Slovenian author. However that was not what I meant. I meant more books from authors translated into English (so not &#8220;Anglo-saxon&#8221;). I did a few, but not as many as I thought. Still, it was a very gratifying reading year with no real misses and only few less satisfying picks.</p>
<p>I read fewer than I hoped and more than I expected even few months ago when I noticed how poorly does my reading mix with my programming. Nexus 7 tablet I bought in the beginning of the year certainly helped with reading electronic books, but I still enjoy it less than paper. The upside is the ease of finding notes which would be even better if they were easily exportable and creating them wasn&#8217;t such a hassle.</p>
<p>As always unaffiliated links point to Amazon and are there only for those that are at least fine. Bold is  reserved for those I found best: <em>This House, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Embers, River Town: Two Years on Yangtze, Chimerica, Decline and Fall</em> and <em>The Fall of the Stone City</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas</a> by Seymour Papert. A book  on constructivist approach to learning written for educators which for me was sometimes a bit of a challenge. Makes a persuasive case for at least a modified approach to learning (wasn&#8217;t won over completely) and did provide some intriguing possibilities for my work.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Peking-Murder-Englishwoman-Haunted/dp/0143121006">Midnight in Peking</a> by Paul French. Similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Suspicions-Mr-Whicher-Murder/dp/0747596484">The Suspicions of Mr. Whitcher</a>. A gripping, well researched story about an &#8220;unsolved&#8221; horrendous murder that vividly brings to life Peking long gone.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Modern-Plays-James-Graham/dp/1472507029">This House</a> by James Graham.</strong> Great and very funny drama about 1974 UK hung parliament that I wish I could see in theater.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X">The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</a> by William H. Whyte.</strong> I bought this book because I wanted to understand why some places in my neighborhood work so much better than others. The book is easy to read, short, but packed with useful information and I can&#8217;t recommend it enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Django-Testing-Debugging-Tracey-Karen/dp/1847197566">Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging</a> by Karen M. Tracey. Book has some flaws: 50$ price on Amazon, sometimes too much details, obsolete Django 1.1. Nevertheless I would recommend it since it does provide a very good and mostly still relevant introduction to this topic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Brother-His-Hakan-Lindquist/dp/3867870853">My Brother and His Brother</a> by Hakan Lindquist. A warm and sad love story about a boy discovering life and personality of brother he never knew. Recommended.</li>
<li><a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a> by Daniel Greenfeld, Audrey Roy. I read this book in alpha and beta form, but can nevertheless heartily recommend it to every Django developer. It gives you something to think about even when you disagree, but you&#8217;ll learn plenty too.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Embers-S%C3%A1ndor-M%C3%A1rai/dp/0375707425">Embers</a> by Sándor Márai.</strong> An engrossing book about passion and betrayal for those drawn more to meditations on nature of human life than surprising turn of events. A masterpiece even in double translation (from Hungarian via German).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351">Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</a> by Steve McConnell. A must-read book on software estimation for every developer. I just wish it had more to say about challenges of estimation in agile environments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Uncommon-Reader-A-Novella/dp/0312427646">The Uncommon Reader</a> by Alan Bennett. A witty book about pleasures and downsides of reading. Good fun for bookworms.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Cups-Deceit-Humanitarian-ebook/dp/B004XHVOW4">Three Cups of Deceit</a> by Jon Krakauer. Investigative journalism at its best. Look at (mal)practice of Central Asia Institute and its founder. Unlikely to be interesting to those who&#8217;ve never heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024514.do">The Accessibility Handbook</a> by Katie Cunningham. This fairly short book has a few minor errors, but it is packed with information and should be required reading for every web developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do">Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization</a> by John Myles White. If you do A/B testing, but don&#8217;t know what bandit algorithms are, then this short, practical and well-written book will noticeably improve your work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Town-Two-Years-Yangtze/dp/0060953748/">River Town: Two Years on Yangtze</a> by Peter Hessler.</strong> A wonderfully alive and sensitive depiction of life in small China town that might change how you see China. Couldn&#8217;t put it down.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Misunderstanding-Irene-Nemirovsky/dp/0099563843/">The Misunderstanding</a> by Irene Nemirovsky. I completely disagree with the review on Amazon. This would be a very good book even if its author wasn&#8217;t 21 when she wrote it. Certainly not sentimental, but also not a overly judgemental look at life of a doomed affair.</li>
<li>PADI Open Water Diver Manual by . Lots of good information, but poorly organized with bunch of infomercial crap at the back. Still much better than cretinous videos and definitely helps to pass the exam.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radiance-King-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590174550">The Radiance of the King</a> by Camara Laye. If you have a literal sort of mind, then don&#8217;t skip Toni Morisson&#8217;s introduction. Beautifully written, still relevant and not completely understood by me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Criticism-Prickly-Paradigm/dp/0972819630">What Happened to Art Criticism</a> by James Elkins. Book that reads like listening to dinner polemic. Still insightful look into why modern art criticism satisfies few, but a bit evasive at times. Did not resolve my problems with modern art.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Porting-Python-3--depth-guide/dp/1456411519/">Porting to Python 3: An in-depth guide</a> by Lennart Regebro. An encouragingly short book on the topic that still feels complete. Made me want to make my code Python3 compatible.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0156027321">Life of Pi</a> by Yann Martel. Read it after I accidentally saw the movie which I surprisingly (to me at least) liked  a lot. The book and the movie are really two takes on the same story, both standing on their own, but I liked the movie a bit better. The book is much darker and not for the squeamish.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimerica-Lucy-Kirkwood/dp/1848423209/">Chimerica</a> by Lucy Kirkwood.</strong> I bought this book after I&#8217;ve seen this remarkable play and it is equally impactful when &#8220;just&#8221; read. Can&#8217;t recommend strongly enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Oberon-Modern-Niklas-Radstrom/dp/1840029285/">Monsters</a> by Niklas Radstrom. Short drama about unfathomable tragedy when children kill a child and the complicity of non-involvement we are guilty of.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926078/">Decline and Fall</a> by Evelyn Waugh.</strong> 85 years old satire of British society that is sadly relevant and very funny.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/">Testable Javascript</a> by Mark Ethan Trostler. A book with (I think) slightly incorrect title. I wish ratio between explaining how to test Javascript and how to set up environment was more in favor of the former, but still good book to read on the subject.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Stone-City-Ismail-Kadare/dp/0802120687">The Fall of the Stone City</a> by Ismail Kadare.</strong> Complex and rich tale of power, dictatorship and integrity. Just read it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Charlie-Hill/dp/1781251630">Books</a> by Charlie Hill. Satire on literary culture and modern art which would be better if characters were not simply 2D archetypes (as I am certain author intended). Often really funny if you share author&#8217;s view (which I do).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raising-Steam-Discworld-novel-Novels/dp/0857522272/">Raising Steam</a> by Terry Pratchett. Does not have subtlety and surprise of his best work, but still funny and enjoyable especially for long time fans with tons of references and favorite characters (not granny though).</li>
</ol>
<p>This year I expect to read fewer than 20 since I would really really like to build a couple of things I&#8217;ve been postponing for years now. Hopefully it will be a good mix of foreign literature and tech books and is also about time I read something substantial in Slovenian.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1186"><![CDATA[<p>Happy and healthy new year! May it be better than the last one.</p>
<p>A year that started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz’s</a> death and ended with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">Nelson Mandela’s</a> never had a chance of being a good one even without Snowden’s revelations and a never-ending supply of bleak news. Alas I promised last year to abstain from commenting on external events to keep annual review posts slashed-wrists risk free.</p>
<p>In some ways this year for me was a lot like the previous one. I worried about health of my family while continuing being lucky and otherwise happy. Today is two years since I started working at <a href="http://aptivate.org/">Aptivate</a> and my enthusiasm hasn’t diminished one iota. So one thing I learned is that I am *not* an incorrigible curmudgeon that can’t stay put.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, especially from mentoring. It really is a blessing to have a wickedly smart and inquisitive mentee and I can’t recommend the experience enough.</p>
<p>I also learned to dive, which will not be a serious hobby but is a convenient skill to have. Visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra">Socotra</a> sadly won’t happen and neither will I dive in south France, but who knows what this year will bring.</p>
<p>What has worked and what not? Monthly reminders of my plans worked fine. I mostly ignored them (plans, not reminders), but at least I was doing this consciously and the frequency was right too so I’ll keep doing them this year. And it’s not like my plans changed only because of my fickleness. Mid-year killing of Google Reader unexpectedly made me busy with search for alternatives and writing exporter for my data in time. I didn’t have time to write a more suitable interface for querying and displaying said data and probably won’t this year either.</p>
<p>List of possible and unfinished projects is still liberating. With added dates of edits it also documents development of my priorities and I don’t mind that I don’t do most of it as long as I do some (which I did).</p>
<p>Digital sabbath also remains a good idea. I haven’t written the overview of books I read in 2013 yet, but I did compare dates on which I finished a book with <a href="https://github.com/samastur">my Github history</a> and it is obvious that I can either read books or code in my free time, but not both unless I actually reserve time for it.</p>
<p>Another thing that proved itself is the importance of continuity of work. Small everyday steps have bigger effect than occasional sprints and they work better when I have a good to-do list which I didn’t always have.</p>
<p>I made an experiment this summer when I spent a day a week working on non-Aptivate project to learn and refresh my knowledge of Javascript tools and techniques and to see what to expect if I spent a day a week on personal projects. It didn’t work as well as I hoped. Day a week + a few hours on other days certainly moves things forward, but it is not a particularly satisfying experience for anyone involved and likely not sustainable either.</p>
<p>What I think would work better (for me) is to combine those off-days together into continuous chunks (say a week every 5 weeks or 2 every 10) for concentrated development of more complex parts of my projects and use those spare daily hours in-between for polishing and infrastructure. Painful side of this is that it reveals how little time I would actually have even if I had noticeably more of it. I am not sure yet what if anything to do with this.</p>
<p>This realisation also led to a painful acceptance of <a href="https://twitter.com/trepca">Sebastjan</a>’s observation that being too busy is simply a function of not pruning ambitions enough. So in 2014 I plan to read less. Who knows how many but I expect noticeably fewer than 20 books.</p>
<p>I will also not work on open data projects except maybe participating on hack days (if there will be any). To be honest I haven’t done much anyway, but I still wasted time and energy worrying about it.</p>
<p>Instead of building tools like <a href="https://github.com/samastur/mjp">mjp</a> or <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/image-diet">image-diet</a> I intend to be more egoistical and work on projects I talked about for years, but never came around developing.  Current projects will likely receive only bug fixes.</p>
<p>Any personal Python software project that will start in 2014 will be written in Python3. Clearly there is no better way to become proficient in it. Actually I expect to start only one project after I finish my current one.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing development journal since October and it is a bit early to say how it is going. I think it is providing insight to what I actually do, but at the same time I am still learning what to record and how. Will see what this year brings.</p>
<p>I’ll be 40 this year which should happen soon enough to not be a challenge and also provides a great motivation to fix my utter failure of this year of getting myself more fit.</p>
<p>My expectations are not evolved enough to be plans, but I imagine 2014 to be even more development intensive than 2013 was. It seems I won’t be attending many conferences, but I don’t expect to be bored. More than anything I hope it will be great year for my family and friends.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1175"><![CDATA[<p>Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.</p>
<p>I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">set things right</a>. No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I&#8217;ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:</p>
<p><em>Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?</em><br />
You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-1" href="#avoid-stupid-1-note">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?</em><br />
Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?</p>
<p><em>Why am I trying to say this?</em><br />
Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.</p>
<p><em>Is it a matter of a principle or degree?</em><br />
I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-2" href="#avoid-stupid-2-note">[2]</a>.</sup></p>
<p><em>Can I be persuaded?</em><br />
I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always run through all these questions, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1161"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Tickets are now <a href="http://www.weezevent.com/djangocon-europe">on sale</a> and it is safe to say that I am not going. The opening price (which will go up after 50 sold tickets) is already too high for me and it is exactly what I was originally afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I am sorry, I overreacted. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear tickets will cover everything except getting there and I have full confidence they will be reasonably priced. Listed transport options for those from my neighborhood are still valid (unless somebody has better data which would be great).</p>
<p>I did not go to DjangoCon Europe in Warsaw this year, but I was certain I would go to the next one. Not anymore.</p>
<p>There is no good way of contacting organizers<sup><a id="djangocon2014-1" href="#djangocon2014-note-1">[1]</a></sup> and not much travel information either on <a href="http://2014.djangocon.eu/">the DjangoCon&#8217;s website</a> or elsewhere. Most of what there is is in French which I don&#8217;t speak so my worries are hopefully unfounded, but what I found so far looks grim.</p>
<p>First transport. It is not organizer&#8217;s fault I live where I do (Ljubljana, Slovenia), but my options are plane (500+€; travel time 6 and 17 hours), train (EUR ??; travel time 14-24h in each direction) or car which would take about 9 hours in one direction and cost around 600€ total per car (180 for tolls, ~400 for fuel with hopefully free parking there).</p>
<p>It is really difficult to get a good idea of how much do hotels on the island cost, but judging by tripadvisor they are not cheap and in general cost 100+€ per day. Staying on the mainland can be done cheap<strong>er</strong>, but I think ferry costs at least 13€ per day so total cost will likely not be very low and you will not be around for any late events.</p>
<p>No idea yet about how easy it is to find suitable food if you are a vegetarian or a vegan or how much does it cost. I assume it can be worked out.</p>
<p>In total this looks significantly more than it did to attend EuroPython in Florence and that was FLORENCE!</p>
<p>I dislike criticizing efforts of others, especially when I know that involves a lot of volunteering and when I am not privy to inside knowledge and dilemmas. However as a regular conference goer it does look to me that there has been a shift happening from egalitarian accessibility of making community conferences cheap and easy enough for anyone to attend to a more stratified approach where money (or time) poor will have to do with video recordings/broadcasts while the rest will get ever flashier experience.</p>
<p>There is obviously a lot of value in meeting face to face (otherwise most of us would probably prefer to save the expense of it) which is why I would find this kind of development sad if it happened to major community gatherings like DjangoCon Europe. So I am hoping that it isn&#8217;t and it won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Like <a title="Comments closed" href="http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2013/07/comments_closed/">Tomaž</a> I had to deal with a flood of comments lately, sadly mostly spam and they are simply taking too much time to clean up. I think I could catch most of them by sending whole comment to Google search, parsing response for excerpts and match for similarity.</p>
<p>Regretfully I don&#8217;t have time to build this and it wouldn&#8217;t scale (I&#8217;m curious why Akismet doesn&#8217;t do something like that). So following Tomaž&#8217;s research my plan is to turn off comments until botnet learns comments here don&#8217;t work and then turn them back on. This shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Until then you will need an account to comment which anyone is free to create (for now). Sorry.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1119"><![CDATA[<p>Building a secure web application is not easy, unless you also use 3rd party code such as Facebook&#8217;s Like widget in which case it is impossible. What you have is just an illusion of security, a door to abuse that you can&#8217;t even check if it is currently closed.</p>
<p>Or that&#8217;s what I thought for years. A once substantiated belief that grew into an almost dogmatic certainty until I recently got a chance to revisit it when trying to design a secure Javascript-based web application living inside of a likely untrusted environment.</p>
<p>There are obvious things you can do to protect your application such as delivery over secure connections and use of anonymous functions to sandbox your code from outside interference. However you will probably need to interact with external code at some point in which case is that <em>XMLHTTPRequest</em> object you are using really the built-in one or has it been replaced (cloaked) with an impostor object to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">the man-in-the-middle attack</a>?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of a way to check if an object is untouched. What is sometimes used instead is a <em>.toString</em> method which on functions and methods returns their source unless they are native to browser in which case it returns a string saying so.</p>
<p>Since you can replace any attribute and method on any object some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6598945/detect-if-function-is-native-to-browser#comment8044242_6599105">go even further</a> in search of a certainty and use <em>.toString</em> from the <em>Function</em> object.</p>
<p>At first thought that looked clever until I came up with:</p>
<ol class="code">
<li><code>&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;head&#62;</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>&#60;meta charset=&#34;UTF-8&#34;&#62;</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>&#60;title&#62;Break check if function is native&#60;/title&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;/head&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;body&#62;</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>&#60;script&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>(function () {</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>var toS = Function.prototype.toString,</code></li>
<li class="tab2"><code>pM_str = window.postMessage.toString();</code></li>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li class="tab1"><code>Function.prototype.toString = function () {</code></li>
<li class="tab2"><code>return this === window.postMessage ? pM_str : toS.call(this);</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>}</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>window.postMessage = function () { console.log('Fake'); };</code></li>
<li><code>})();</code></li>
<li class="tab1"><code>&#60;/script&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;/body&#62;</code></li>
<li><code>&#60;/html&#62;</code></li>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li class="download">Download this code: <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/code/nativecheck.txt" title="Download the above code as a text file">/code/nativecheck.txt</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The code above replaces <em>Function&#8217;s .toString</em> method with a one that lies when executed on an also cloaked <em>window.postMessage</em>. Instead of displaying source of the new <em>postMessage</em> it prints whatever browser would print for the original one.</p>
<p>It simultaneously demonstrates how you can cloak native Javascript objects and hide that you are doing it. If you put malicious code into an anonymous function and remove <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> node that added it after it gets executed, then there is no way for scripts loading later to know that it happened. There will be no traces of crime.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to cloak literals like {} and [], but you certainly can their methods so even if your code is wrapped in an anonymous function, it isn&#8217;t really secured from outside peeking and poking. Hence you even <strong>can&#8217;t trust your own code</strong>.</p>
<p>Turns out that this particular dogma is also true. Depressing.</p>
