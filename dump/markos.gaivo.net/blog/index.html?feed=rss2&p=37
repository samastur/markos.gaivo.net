		<description>I still use WordPress, but that is mainly through inertia that comes from acute lack of time.

WordPress certainly got better although I still wouldn&#039;t go as far as calling it friendly. Its code is still a mess, but it does have a lot of plugins so there is good chance you might never have to touch it (code that is).

I come in regular contact with most popular blogging platforms because of my work (I work for Zemanta, which builds a blogging helper), but that contact is somewhat limited. Typepad seems one of more sanely organized, but honestly, I find all of them lacking.

A blog on wordpress.com might give you a pretty good idea on what to expect from wordpress, although you can significantly upgrade a standalone version through plugins.

Blogger seems a bit friendlier, but taking care of comments and spam there is pure annoyance.

Then again it might be just me, so my advice would be to not listen to me much and just try few of them and see which is most tolerable to you.</description>

		<description>I agree that wordpress is not that user friendly. i tried using wordpress and i find it a bit confusing when it comes to the ase of use and speed of the procedure. The password generation feature sucks! i think blogger may have some FEW downsides, but WordPress has some downsides too and i thin its worst that blogger.</description>
