		<description>Stumbled on this, worked for me.  If you can process .xml it may suffice.

		<description>My own personal solution has now evolved to be Tiny Tiny RSS for the frontend and gmail for tagging and archival storage.  If I like an article I click the share button and send it to a gmail account for review at a later point.  Gmail supports tagging and also will probably not disappear anytime soon.</description>

		<description>Which reader would I like to see supported?  A reader that tags articles like Google Reader  ... does. not. exist.

I envision a bifurcated solution: articleReader for reading and articleTagger for tagging.

articleReader: like newsblur, feedly, ttr ...
articleTagger: something like pinboard for tagged articles ...

Until then, will be importing json tagged articles into firefox/chrome bookmarks.</description>

		<description>No, did not get around to it yet. I since switched to Tiny Tiny RSS which seems to have support for importing articles, but still need to write a script that will translate my JSON to tt-rss. I started work on resolving feedburner links in case that also disappears.

Which reader would you like to see supported?

I&#039;ve been also thinking about creating also HTML export which could make export more useful also to those who won&#039;t or can&#039;t import articles elsewhere.</description>

		<description>Marko, 

Thank you for a great python script.  Our tagged articles are saved in JSON.  Now what ... have you been able to upload the tagged articles into any other RSS reader?  

Thanks, Clay</description>

		<description>Hello guyz
the best way to back up tagged articles till now:
1- make tag public in greader
2- use this link
http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F01597317633809385927%2Flabel%2FArt?n=1000 (replace ur greader id with 01597317633809385927 and ur tag name with Art)
3- download newzcrawler
4- add the link to channel newsfeed and turn automatic update off
this is the best way i figured out.</description>

		<description>Thank you, thank you for sharing this information.  I have been walking around in a fog since the news about GReader&#039;s impending decommission.  With the hopes that you&#039;ll be able to work out any sticking points with a Windows install, I look forward to learning more.  I would love to get the instruction by email or however you decide to post it.  Bless you for sharing!   :)</description>

		<description>Instructions are definitely lacking and together with Amir we found a few issues with installing them on Windows.

I am finally back from my business trip so I expect to have some time this weekend to resolve these issues and provide an easier and better documented way of installing and running my script.

Thanks for the patience.</description>

		<description>Thank you! It&#039;s so annoying that Google didn&#039;t think of the people like us who actually used the features they put in Reader.

I&#039;m in the same boat as the Amir and Nomen - I&#039;m not so tech-savvy as to know exactly how to use the script. Instructions would be helpful!</description>

		<description>Hey Markos, thanks for this script..keep wondering why there is nothing else that would extract the tags from reader but luckily we have you. Same problem as Amir though. Can you forward the mail you send him :D</description>
