			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=604" rel="bookmark">Review of expense tracker Toshl</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Three months ago I received an invitation to try and review <a class="zem_slink" title="Toshl" rel="homepage" href="http://toshl.com">Toshl</a>, a mobile expense tracker developed by <a class="zem_slink" title="ThirdFrameStudios" rel="homepage" href="http://www.3fs.si">ThirdFrameStudios</a>. I also received code to get? Pro account free for first year to help me test it, which saved me a modest amount of 20 euros. It is also not a secret that I know people working at 3fs and admire their work.</p>
<p>As influences go, that&#8217;s it. I received neither threats to pets I don&#8217;t have or contributions to a bank account I do have. Also a complete absence of nudges means that this post took longer than planned and that all opinions are mine. Too make them less ignorant I decided at start to give Toshl a proper test and use it for couple of months before passing judgment.</p>
<p>Toshl, as mentioned, is a tool for keeping track of expenses. You are obviously sensible enough to know why this is wise, if you are still reading this, so I won&#8217;t bother explaining. It comes as a free application for <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> devices and <a class="zem_slink" title="Maemo" rel="homepage" href="http://www.maemo.org/">Maemo</a> based N900. I heard rumors of an <a class="zem_slink" title="iPhone 3G" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> version, but Symbian or <a class="zem_slink" title="BlackBerry" rel="homepage" href="http://www.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a> owners are out of luck (for now). Using web based companion and synchronization is free too, but you have to pay for Pro account if you want to add expenses through website or need a more flexible export of your data.</p>
<p>I tested Nokia N900 version of Toshl and liked it. I don&#8217;t want to go into details since they quickly become boring and there is no better test than your own (remember, it&#8217;s free). I was impressed how well it handles <a class="zem_slink" title="Decimal separator" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator">decimal separator</a> for me, since I sin by using both comma and point.</p>
<p>Entering expenses is easy and quick, especially if you have entered similar recently, since you can reuse tags just by clicking on suggested. You also see already entered expenses sorted by time or tags. There is still room for improvement (like adapting tags suggestions based on first entered), but not much to fault.</p>
<p>I believe Toshl&#8217;s goal is to be as simple and fun tracker of everyday expenses as possible. You can do basic add and removal of expenses, export inserted data, categorize each entry with tags and see few different reports. That&#8217;s it. There is no integration with banks, currency conversions,? or even a notion of income. Reports are basic and I am not a fan of those included.</p>
<p>I usually used more than one tag on each expense and had difficulty wrapping my head around graphs where same expense could be shown multiple times. I failed at judging how much impact do some expenses have overall without at least some tweaking of graphs. I am certain that Tufte would call it chartjunk, but their implementation certainly is fun to play with.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where Toshl&#8217;s main strength is. A fun way of doing something that most people find incredibly tedious. You might overgrow it one day and switch, but it will help you develop a necessary habit of recording your expenses.</p>
<p>Being simple and fun doesn&#8217;t mean powerless. Tags free you to your own categorization and multiple export options give you an opportunity to massage that data further in tools of your choice. It might not be as trivial as clicking on a graph is, but doing it in Excel is not much harder.</p>
<p>I will not continue to use it because I am that sort of person who gets off on <a class="zem_slink" title="Double-entry bookkeeping system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system">double-entry bookkeeping</a>. I&#8217;ve been using <a class="zem_slink" title="GnuCash" rel="homepage" href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> for years and there is no easy way to sync data with it (probably shouldn&#8217;t be either) and few reasons to input every expense twice. I do recommend anyone who isn&#8217;t tracking yet or is not satisfied with his current approach to give Toshl a try.</p>
<p>And if you are happy with free version, then buy a Pro account. It costs little, gives you features as polished as rest of service and it help secure your apps future.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I love using <a class="zem_slink" title="N900" rel="homepage" href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">N900</a>, but there are applications or features I miss. This post is a reminder to me on what I might do if I find more time. Since list is too long for me to do everything (unless I suddenly win lottery), feel free to pick an idea you like and run with it. Just let me know afterwards where I can see results of your work or participate in development.</p>
<p><strong>Offline Wikipedia.</strong> When I am not behind a computer or reading, I like to be outdoors and even though cheap always available Internet was supposed to be here any day now, I regularly find myself information hungry in places with a very slow or no Internet connection. N900 with SD card could pretty much store everything I wanted and building an app that process and display information from <a title="Wikipedia dumps starting page" href="http://download.wikimedia.org/">Wikipedia dumps</a> doesn&#8217;t look like a too difficult task.</p>
<p><strong>Better dictionary for Maemo. </strong>QStarDict port<strong> </strong> is great and it has become one of my favorite applications. However its user interface suffers from being a direct port of a desktop version one and could be improved with one that wastes less space and is orientation aware. Reading dictionary is one of few things I wish I could do in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>Web platform for Maemo.</strong> Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you could build Maemo applications with web technologies? <a title="Link to QtWebKit documentation" href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qtwebkit.html">QtWebKit</a> is a great place to start and I am certain I could expose new functionality through <em>addToJavascriptWindowObject</em> of <a title="Link to QWebFrame documentation" href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwebframe.html">QWebFrame</a> class. Beside exposing this stuff I would also like to create tools and interfaces for developers and users alike with which they can easily package a web application as a standalone Maemo application or in case of users, turn a website into an application (I know you can add a bookmark to a website but it is not quite the same thing).</p>
<p><strong><a title="Caffeine for Mac" href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> for N900.</strong> I would like to pick <em>&#8220;Switch profile to silent for &lt;x time&gt;&#8221;</em> and know N900 will turn back normal profile when that time period expires. I always forget to turn ringing back on after I leave cinema.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor unknown calls.</strong> I don&#8217;t want to pollute my address book with every phone number under the sun, but I would appreciate if I could get a hint if I ever talked or called the number in question. Bonus points for using public phone books to fetch name for given number and parsing number for clues (which country or part of it is call coming from).</p>
<p>This is not a complete list of things I want, but rest are mostly feature requests (except email client which currently really kind of sucks). For example I wish calendar had support for <a class="zem_slink" title="CalDAV" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> or PDF viewer for screen rotate, search and fit to width.</p>
<p>I am aware that Maemo should be called MeeGo now, but a habit of years can&#8217;t be changed in few weeks. I searched for above applications and didn&#8217;t find them, but if you know of any I missed, then please let me know.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=563" rel="bookmark">A month with Nokia N900</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Title says it. A month is enough time to get a better understanding of the device and to get asked repeatedly about my impressions. Many have wrote theirs, so I doubt I will be telling anything really new. Before I go on, a short disclaimer, since my writings on this blog stay around longer than might be sensible.</p>
<p>I wrote this post at the start of February 2010. I believe everything I write about technology to be hopelessly out of date after 6 months, but I expect this article will be obsolete even sooner. So by the time you got around reading this, most of my gripes might not even be true anymore.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Nokia N900" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900">Nokia N900</a> is an uncut diamond. A wonderful thing made by talented designers that has quite a few rough edges, not all of them in device. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to most people, but to some of you it might become your favorite computer. It goes with me almost anywhere.</p>
<p>If you want a rock solid phone, then this device is not for you. I was unlucky to be in minority of people who experienced constant reboots. By constant I mean few times every hour.? My <a class="zem_slink" title="Nokia" rel="homepage" href="http://nokia.com">Nokia</a> also lacked a 2GB partition, which meant I was constantly running out of space in which to install applications. Both of this problems have since been fixed. I still have a problem with <a class="zem_slink" title="GSM" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM">GSM</a> connection occasionally completely dying, which I can fix only by manual reboot. I&#8217;m personally not bothered since I don&#8217;t use it as phone.</p>
<p>On the other hand updates to software are regular, with one major firmware update already, that fixed some of my problems (reboot). Annoyances of today might literally be gone by tomorrow and thus my disclaimer.</p>
<p>I know how much effort goes in good software and don&#8217;t want to be too negative, but email really does suck for IMAP users. Not only doesn&#8217;t it cache headers, so if you have a slow connection and a big Inbox, get used to waiting. You also can&#8217;t set sent mail, drafts or trash folders which makes it useless to me for anything but reading email. Even worse, it creates its own folders (like <a class="zem_slink" title="IPod Touch" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch">iPod touch</a>) to make a mess in your account. I am all for simplicity and avoiding needless configuration options, but it could at least get a list of folders and compare Levenshtein&#8217;s distance to common names (Sent, Sent mail&#8230;).</p>
<p>Gecko (Mozilla) based browser though is great, in my opinion much better than iPod&#8217;s and I completely switched my mobile browsing to N900. I am biased since unlike many I never was fond of constant zooming in and out (with pinching). My opinion might have been different if my eye-sight was poorer and I needed to zoom more.</p>
<p>If you are a Linux user or appreciate freedom, then it&#8217;s difficult to find a better mobile device. N900 is a Linux machine which happens to also be a phone and you have complete access to everything. There is a store (Ovi) and app manager, but you can install and run anything willing to run without permission from anybody. Terminal is loaded by default together with tools needed to prod into the system and root is one package installation away.</p>
<p>I dislike fixed space of iPod. N900 is only slightly better. You can expand it with SD cards, but you have to open battery cover. It looks so fragile that I don&#8217;t intend to actually do this unless absolutely necessary. Speaking of storage, as a programmer I can understand why applications can use only 2GB of it, but as user it simply looks daft.</p>
<p>Pair of contact and conversations applications is absolutely brilliant. Instant messaging, Skype and SMS are superbly integrated and they also feed contact application with information about your buddies found on those networks.? Install Hermes and you can update it with data from Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Screen has higher resolution than iPod&#8217;s, but physically same (small) size, which means I&#8217;ll keep reading PDFs on my 770. Since it&#8217;s resistive instead of capacitive, it needs more pressure than iPod&#8217;s, but works better at -12 degrees centigrade (<a title="French Alps - photo taken by N900" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/4268784785/">this picture</a> was taken with my gloves on).</p>
<p>Maemo has a very active and generally supportive community, but some members can also be <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6334#c19">needlessly unfriendly</a>. Just because you know where everything is and have seen certain faux pas 100 times before, it doesn&#8217;t mean either is true for a new N900 owner with a problem.</p>
<p>N900 RUNS PYTHON, which was my main reason for preferring it over an <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> phone. Documentation is a bit all over the place, not always current and I still haven&#8217;t found information about how to control built in cameras, but I am an optimist that this will be sorted out soon and that documentation will improve as well.</p>
<p>I compared N900 with diamond, but maybe a better comparison would be a sports car. If you want a polished, sedated experience then N900 is certainly not for you (yet). But if you are a tinkerer who doesn&#8217;t mind rough edges in exchange for freedom to make it do almost anything, then you should give it a spin.</p>
<p>There is so much more that could be said, but big picture wouldn&#8217;t change much. I haven&#8217;t talked much about UI since I simply couldn&#8217;t do it justice in few sentences. On the whole it works fine and multitasking is really great even though I think iPhone/iPad&#8217;s switch-to-where-you-were model is in my experience rarely a problem and wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was here to stay.</p>
<p>If there is anything about it you would like to know, then please ask and I&#8217;ll try to respond to it promptly.</p>
