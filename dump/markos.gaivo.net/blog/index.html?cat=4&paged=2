			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I like <a href="https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails">easy-thumbnails</a> and use it often in my Django projects, but I wished for a long time that its <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> generated thumbnails would be smaller. That&#8217;s why I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">image-diet</a>, a drop-in extension for those easy-thumbnails users who use file system for storing images. Images remain visually the same, but can be significantly smaller (mine by more than 50% but your mileage my vary).</p>
<p>This matters because images are together with Javascript main cause for ever larger page sizes which leads to slower websites, especially in low-bandwidth environments. But really, don&#8217;t we all want our websites to be as fast as possible?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">image-diet</a> was inspired by <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kilian/Trimage">Trimage</a> and I&#8217;m grateful to authors of both. It uses jpegtran, Jpegoptim, Gifsicle, OptiPNG, AdvanceCOM PNG and Pngcrush to do the heavy work of squeezing redundant bytes. Getting them should be easy as they are part of Ubuntu distribution and can be installed on Mac with brew. For more information please check documentation or ask.</p>
<p>I would love to hear any comments and ideas you may have, even more so if you try it.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>As a person with a somewhat unusual fondness for measuring and modelling my own behavior I should be a happy buyer of <a title="Jawbone's UP" href="https://jawbone.com/up">gadgets</a> for <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/one">collecting data</a> about myself and my environment. Yet so far I bought none, because they don&#8217;t seem to work <em>well</em> without (occasional) data sync with producer&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>I really shouldn&#8217;t have to explain privacy standpoint of this. Describing my life and immediate environment in detail to a bunch of people I have never met, some of whom don&#8217;t even work for the company yet and trusting all of them that they will not compromise it for as long as they will keep it is to me self-evidently moronic.</p>
<p>But I also avoid such hardware even when data in question might not be particularly sensitive. If I am paying for something to be manufactured, then I expect to own it. If a gadget depends on an external service to be useful, then I am really only leasing it. Services disappear for many reasons and it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to rely on their availability unless you can host them yourself. I loath ads, but paying for a service is not a guarantee for its continuing presence either.</p>
<p>I am not against functionality that reasonably requires at least occasional connection to grid. Most social features probably do. Products like phones don&#8217;t even make sense without network. Web interfaces certainly do make these devices cheaper and more quickly evolving. So there are certainly good reasons beyond roping you in to make them partially off-loaded on web.</p>
<p>However I don&#8217;t want to use those features and I certainly don&#8217;t want to give up data I care about for features I don&#8217;t. What I expect from devices I buy is my control of data and purchased functionality without others meddling or peeking over my shoulders.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=936" rel="bookmark">Save bandwidth switch</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Michal Migurski recently posted <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/bandwidth.html">an article</a> about download sizes of popular websites. I couldn&#8217;t replicate his results<sup><a id="save-bandwidth-1" href="#save-bandwidth-note-1">[1]</a></sup>, but it is obvious that gist of Michal&#8217;s article is correct, websites have indeed ballooned significantly in last few years.</p>
<p>This blog&#8217;s homepage has a footprint of around 250KB-270KB<sup><a id="save-bandwidth-2" href="#save-bandwidth-note-2">[2]</a></sup>. About 90% of its size are fonts and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which is a big penalty for making it look and behave a bit nicer. So should I remove those parts?</p>
<p>Well, for most visitors to this website that difference doesn&#8217;t matter. Pages for them are neither slow nor expensive to load. Unless of course they are doing it over your average hotel Wi-Fi or a slow mobile network where speed around 56Kb/s is not unheard of. On such connection it would take about half a minute to load this blog. It can also cost more than 10 euro cents to load it when roaming in Europe.</p>
<p>It would be great if I could offer a choice of serving bigger and nicer or smaller and faster version depending on visitors needs.</p>
<p>Measuring speed is not easy, but certainly doable as Gmail has demonstrated. You could start a timer immediately in page header, measure how much time it takes to load a smaller version of a website and if that happened quickly enough upgrade it to full bling. Android browser also added support for <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/index.html">navigator.connection</a> Javascript property which, where it exists, probably has more details than you would need.</p>
<p>However there is no way to measure price of a visit. Even if I could, how would I decide what is too expensive for an anonymous reader and should I make such decisions at all? I think not.</p>
<p>Gmail&#8217;s approach is really just a band-aid over what should be a visitor&#8217;s decision. I use same laptop and browser at home and while I travel, experiencing all combinations of connection speed and pricing. I never know how much it will cost me to visit a page, but I always learn quickly if I would prefer something small or full-featured. There is just no way I can communicate that preference.</p>
<p>It would be great if my browser had a switch for this purpose, like Firefox&#8217;s &#8220;Work Offline&#8221; toggle. So if I switched to bandwidth saving mode, then every subsequent request to web server would communicate my preference with a HTTP header field like:</p>
<blockquote><p>X-Bandwidth: save</p></blockquote>
<p>In principle you could have multiple levels of bandwidth consumption, but that would likely be an overkill. Common practice suggests that at most two levels would really get used, one aimed at mobile devices and other at desktop.</p>
<p>Header like that might be enough, but even better would be if Javascript environment got another property describing current state of user&#8217;s preference (like say <em>navigator.bandwidth</em>). Coupled with a bandwidth event triggered on change you could really optimize every modern web page, even those with more complicated loading of resources and execution paths.</p>
<p>Right now such functionality doesn&#8217;t exist or at least I couldn&#8217;t find it (I even searched Mozilla&#8217;s bug database for any future plans). I think my proposal is both user and developer friendly and workable. If you can think of a reason why it would be problematic, then I would really like to hear it.</p>
<ol>
<li id="save-bandwidth-note-1">Pages are often personalized for visitor. Developer tools of different browsers also don&#8217;t report same sizes. They also report amount of data transferred not the size of that data once unpacked. Almost 2M of Twitter&#8217;s Javascript is thus reduced into page of &#8220;only&#8221; about 1MB of data transferred. And that to display couple of sentences.<a href="#save-bandwidth-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="save-bandwidth-note-2">Depends on browser used. Variation in sizes is probably due different formats of fonts used by browsers. It also changed once I published this post.<a href="#save-bandwidth-2">↩</a></li>
