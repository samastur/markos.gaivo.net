			<div class="post-text">
				<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Joshua Porter" rel="blog" href="http://bokardo.com">Joshua Porter&#8217;s</a> workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that&#8217;s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook Connect" rel="homepage" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> as Facebook &#8220;owning&#8221; their users.</p>
<p>They are right, but it doesn&#8217;t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.</p>
<p>My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.</p>
<p>I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?</p>
<p>There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.</p>
<p>Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Awareness -&gt; Sign-up -&gt; First-time use -&gt; Engagement -&gt; Referral</p></blockquote>
<p>Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.</p>
<p>Using Facebook Connect (or <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="OpenID Foundation" rel="homepage" href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>&#8230;) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It&#8217;s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to &#8220;full&#8221; members to make such commitment more enticing.</p>
<p>If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?</p>
<p>Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.</p>
<p>All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I&#8217;ll let you know how it went.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I am not much of a <a title="My YouTube channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur">YouTube user</a>, but I have recently started to upload some of my work <a title="my demos on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/msamastur">there</a>. You might find them interesting if you are into interactions prototypes for products that may never be (especially if you are a <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> user).</p>
<p>I want to stress that while we use prototypes to learn what to implement and how, there is no guarantee that any particular feature shown will be actually included in our products. We do make an effort of listening to our users so please tell us what you think.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to mention that I don&#8217;t lead front-end team at Zemanta anymore. My new title is Chief Product Officer which is a fancy way of saying that it is my task to care about our products and our users more deeply than anybody else.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There&#8217;s an HTML pattern that has been bugging me for a while even though I&#8217;m guilty of using it too. It&#8217;s even present on page you are reading right now.</p>
<p>Almost every page has a navigation bar and chances are that strip is presented as some kind of a list of links. Just as it should be. What bothers me is that when you actually are on page listed in navigation, its navigation item will <a title="An example of this pattern" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">still contain</a> a link to it.</p>
<p>This reference to itself is like having a door in a room which leads you back in. Not very useful and certainly misleading.</p>
<p>Better approach is to simply not have a link when that link would point to page itself. Such HTML is also more semantic, since it&#8217;s clear which item was selected and where we are even without a style sheet.</p>
<p>When discussing this observation it was pointed out to me that with proliferation of Javascript and AJAX you might want to give your visitors a way to bring a page to a known state by reloading it. I think this is more than adequately solved by reload button that every browser has and most users know, but if you find having a link a better solution, why not try a compromise. Just add the missing link with Javascript in spirit of <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/html_pattern/link.html">this demo</a>.</p>
<p>This way you won&#8217;t polute content markup with behavior that should sit on top of it.</p>
