			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=608">plan</a> to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.</p>
<p>It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years&#8230;Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.</p>
<p>It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.</p>
<p>I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.</p>
<p>I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).</p>
<p>I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?<a class="zem_slink" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133">4 hour work week</a>, which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.</p>
<p>I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why <sup>[<a href="#book-1">1</a>]</sup> again draws no sympathy from me.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.What do I want?</p>
<p>I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like <a class="zem_slink" title="Pixel Qi" rel="homepage" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/">Pixel Qi</a> will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.</p>
<p>However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.</p>
<ol style="margin-top:3em">
<li id="book-1">You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.</li>
