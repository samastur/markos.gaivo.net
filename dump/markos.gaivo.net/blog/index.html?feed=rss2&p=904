		<description>Thanks. It&#039;s not too strict since its purpose is to get me do stuff I otherwise don&#039;t do (enough), not to be pure. As it happens I read mostly paper books, but I wouldn&#039;t mind e-readers since it is reading I want to do. I do think having a set time in week for it helps me because then I am not tempted to skip it by moving it around until it would fall off schedule (same goes for regular exercise).

Whatever works for you is fine as long as it frees your time from things you do too much already, but I do find simple rules to be easier to follow. Mine is really to avoid computing, communication and internet (so even computer as VCR would be fine) and do this from Friday evening to Saturday evening.

I like to have ideas on the wall behind my back because that way I see them often enough to pick one up without them being too distracting.</description>

		<description>I really like your year review posts. End of December is always so full of things for me I never find the opportunity to reflect in peace on the past 12 months and in January it feels too late.

Nice ideas by the way. I forgot to ask last time: how strict is your digital sabbath? I guess it includes phones, but what about e-book readers? Where do you draw the line?

I might try sticking my random ideas above my desk. Just yesterday I flipped through my notebook and noticed I hardly ever go back to those notes.</description>
