		<description>Phones are usually used because of the reason no. 2. They get to you. I agree, emails are usually a far more convinient and useful way to contact someone, if not for anything else, the sheer amount of data you can &quot;send&quot; via phone is insignificant compared to email, and yet phone have the power to &quot;break through&quot; and touch you. 

Maybe we are talking about two different things, but in journalism, sometimes a phone call can solve more than a thousand emails worth. 

I guess it all depends.</description>
