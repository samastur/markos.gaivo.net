			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I get a feeling sometimes, that most blogs are an outlet for people to complain about something. I know I do it more often than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ll do it less, but this post is another rant.</p>
<p>Lately, whenever I read or hear anyone mentioning Apple, my blood starts boiling. Reason for this is quite simple; today is a two-month anniversary since I took my broken iMac to local Apple service and it&#8217;s also the day when they let me know, they got another broken motherboard from Apple so they can&#8217;t tell me when they&#8217;ll be able to fix it. But they can give me my money back.</p>
<p>It would be awful even if this was the only time I ever had a problem with Apple. Sadly it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I can understand that every manufacturing line produces a certain percentage of faulty products. I might accept, unwillingly,  that Apple products on whole fail less often than competition and that it&#8217;s just my bad luck that got me a faulty computer. But this hardly matters, if you have no real idea when they&#8217;ll be fixed, when they actually do break.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s far better for me, as a user, to have a product that fails twice as often, but which can be and more importantly, will be fixed in a couple of days, then something that presumably almost never fails, but when it does, it might take an unspecified number of months before you&#8217;ll get it fixed.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m quite certain I won&#8217;t be buying anything hardware related from Apple anytime soon. I have to decide if this includes getting rid of this iMac or not. Getting rid of it means I&#8217;ll probably won&#8217;t get my data back and I certainly won&#8217;t finish a couple of projects.</p>
<p>The other dilemma is what to say, when friends ask me about Apple products, which every now and then they do. I had a good experience with my local Apple reseller (more or less Apple only shop)  and would like to recommend them, but it&#8217;s impossible for me to recommend products they are selling. Truth may set me free.</p>
<p>I wish Linux had a better video and photo editing software. It&#8217;s the only area I can think of where it doesn&#8217;t actually exceed my expectations.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been sporadically using <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> for last two days and it&#8217;s an interesting take on a modern browser and social computing. Two features that I found most useful are bookmarks (or favorites, as flock calls them) integration with <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and history index. Especially the last one.</p>
<p>Flock indexes every downloaded page, so when you start typing a query in search window, it presents a list of matches from your history. Everytime I try to find a page in my browser history, I find myself amazed at how many pages I read every day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those in hindsight obvious features that I hope, expect really, to see in other browsers fairly soon. It&#8217;s just makes sense.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less obvious how you make money with software that you can&#8217;t charge for. Opera demonstrated (and Flock intends to <a href="http://www.decrem.com/bart/2005/10/creating-sustainable-value/" title="Description of Flock's business model">follow</a>) there are other business models that work at least for now. I hope it&#8217;ll also work for Flock.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>It turns out Apple introduced new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" title="Link to Apple iPod page">iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="Link to Apple iMac page">iMac</a> and iTunes too. Video watching is in. Now you can watch video on your iPod and you can buy (if you have access to iTunes USA store) episodes of ABC&#8217;s popular shows, but in ridiculously small format (320&#215;240).</p>
<p>Personally, I doubt I&#8217;ll be buying anything made by Apple anytime soon. My iMac still hasn&#8217;t been repaired and I have no idea when it will be. I wouldn&#8217;t have spare macs lying around even if I could afford it and this makes them more or less unusable to me for professional work.</p>
