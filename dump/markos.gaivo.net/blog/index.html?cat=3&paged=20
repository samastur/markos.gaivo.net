				<p>There&#8217;s hardly a worse way to end a vacation than catching a flu. There are also better starts to flu then midnight spells of vomiting, when your stomach is completely empty. All you do is spit acid and brush teeth afterwards in hope they might stick around a bit longer.<a href="http://www.marela.si/photos/9688/" class="imageR"><img src="http://static.marela.si/users0/markos/2/3k3Jipz--q6-zqjBRiYviLMzibE.jpg" alt="Anchor on Zanzibar beach" /></a><br />
The good thing is that it beats catching malaria, which I hopefully didn&#8217;t, and that it only gets better onwards. I seem to be left only with a slight cold and a nasty <strong>*censored*</strong> problem that I&#8217;m hoping will disappear in next few days. I&#8217;m almost through my unread emails as well so if you&#8217;ve sent me something and haven&#8217;t heard from me yet, this would be a good time to send me a reminder.<br />
This vacation has been very much unlike the others. It was the first time in years, well, since I started working really, that I didn&#8217;t work at all while being on vacation. I didn&#8217;t think of work either, an odd experience I enjoyed with gusto.<br />
Still, a long way home provided ample opportunity for reflection, hazy thoughts and dubious decisions one of which is that I&#8217;m going to rewrite this site and create my own publishing platform, which will be better suited than those known to me for things I need and things I&#8217;d like to try out.<br />
I&#8217;ve also given myself a deadline, a year, in which to come up with this thing. A deadline that I think provides enough time to hope for sucess and not enough to slack.<br />
What won&#8217;t change is the low frequency of my posts, a belief strengthened by wading through hundreds of unread posts accumulated in my feed reader while I was gone, majority of which being little more than a waste of time. But who am I to complain.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I need help. I&#8217;m looking to expand my horizons, learn something new and generally make positive and decisive steps to being less ignorant. I&#8217;d be most grateful, if you could help me, dear reader, by pointing out interesting and useful resources out there.</p>
<p>The topics are not really important. I may be biased to deepening my knowledge of history and design, but every topic and more importantly, every resource is a good one as long as you personally find it interesting and it&#8217;s accessible to neophytes.</p>
<p>There is an exception to this. Resources about software and software development should be avoided unless they cover the field from a completely original point of view or were created by an author, who is raving mad. I&#8217;d prefer both, but later requirement probably already includes former.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about the form either as long as it&#8217;s fairly accessible. Books, blogs, podcasts, movies etc. are all fair game, but conferences with couple of thousand dollars entrance fees (or organized in USA) aren&#8217;t.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=184" rel="bookmark">First anniversary</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Today is this blog&#8217;s first anniversary. I posted my first post after I came back from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia/">@media</a> conference, which is where I&#8217;m going tomorrow. I&#8217;m sure it will be even better than last year, but I somehow don&#8217;t look forward to it. I got used to traveling with my wife and lost the lust for going solo.</p>
<p>In this year I wrote 176 posts (not including this one) or almost one every two days. A lot and certainly too many for them all to be worth reading. I hope at least some of them have been.</p>
<p>Reliable statistics are a bitch. I installed different packages at various times, each using their own approach to tracking, which produced lots of numbers of dubious quality. Still, for the interested few, this blog has been accessed by more than 12 thousand individuals at least 23 thousand times. Counting all visits including feed update checks, 116 thousand visits resulted in more than 264 thousand generated pages.</p>
<p>Majority of visitors didn&#8217;t come from Slovenia (only 25.8%), so it was probably not a stupid idea to write this blog in English even if my countrymen read above average number of pages per visit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m completely humbled by the amount of time that was spent reading or scanning this blog, even if each visitor spent only a second on it. I hope it was worth it and that most of them don&#8217;t miss that second. I&#8217;m even more amazed that some of you liked it enough to subscribe to it.</p>
<p>Since summaries like this are far more fun to write than to read, I&#8217;ll end this one and make it the last. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you again.</p>
