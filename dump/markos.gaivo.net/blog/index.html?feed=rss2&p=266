		<description>On Windows, you can even have isolated Firefox Portable instances with separate configurations. There&#039;s, I think, an extension that then enables you to sync configuration between multiple instances.

While you can&#039;t run FF2 and FF3 simultaneously (Portable version nags about the running instance of FF3 before starting), you can run them separately, at least. Much less fuss than running a VM for the sole sake of testing on IE6.

Problem is that with the new version, the plugin code needed to be ported, something that doesn&#039;t happen often for some of the less popular extensions. It&#039;s a two-edged sword - the same thing you&#039;re dealing with MS needs to deal with too for their IE8 &lt;meta&gt; tags. Sadly, there&#039;s no good single answer to any of these issues, and almost all of the solutions require a tradeoff the end user has to pay.</description>

		<description>As it happens, I know I can do this, but I don&#039;t find this easy. And I hate profile manager with a passion.

You know what I would find easy? Having both versions installed and each used only parts of configuration or add-ons it can understand and leave rest the fuck alone, if it absolutely has to use the same configuration files. You know, like how browsers were supposed to handle HTML.

If you take a look at configuration files, as I did when I moved to FF3, it&#039;s quite obvious that developers themselves can&#039;t decide. E.g. signons.txt is different for each major version of Firefox, but other files in general aren&#039;t.</description>

		<description>well, I generally agree with your rant about multiple versions installed simultaneously, but if you only searched the web before installing you&#039;d find out that the trick is easy: install F3 into a different directory, run profile manager to create a new profile, edit shortcuts to run the desired version with the corresponding profile. Works on windows and linux.

I&#039;d switch to F3, but for the next few months I&#039;ll still have to develop for both. The browser test group just got another new member.</description>
