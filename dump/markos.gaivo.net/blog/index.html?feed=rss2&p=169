		<description>Yeah well all you can do is hope that inside they&#039;re really thinking it&#039;s a disaster. The thing is Sony was always known for their aggressive pricing in the first stages of the product. In a year the price will go down to XBox&#039;s.</description>

Here&#039;s a nice little graph showing the prices of gaming consoles over the years. The second one even takes inflation into account.

Personally I don&#039;t care for the blu-ray and hard-drive extras, most likely it will end up being crippled anyways so that the PS3 unit doesn&#039;t compete with higher-end players sony will probably make.

And honestly I don&#039;t see little kids convincing their parents to pay 425 quid for a gaming console with the argument &quot;Yeah mom, but it can play blu-ray as well.&quot;</description>
