		<description>I played around with finding out the locale from JavaScript, but it seems to be quite flawed: at least in Mozilla I could only get to the &#039;build language&#039; of the browser, not to the locale set by the user (so on English Mozilla builds that had de_DE as preferred language, asking for the locale would return en_US). This made the information rather useless, therefore at that point I decided to use information from the server instead, or have the locale set by the user in the web application seperately (in one app, a &#039;client-side CMS&#039; using WebDAV (http://johnnydebris.net:8080/projects/cmc/cmc.html, not complete and abandoned, but still pretty cool ;) I used cookies to store the info).

I&#039;m not sure how to properly deal with this problem...

Anyway, about the i18n lib, not sure whether it wouldn&#039;t make sense to join forces somehow? Perhaps you can send patches or whatnot, or I could even give you SVN checkin rights so we can work on the lib together? I wouldn&#039;t mind improving it, as long as the API doesn&#039;t change too drastically (it&#039;s currently in use by Kupu, meaning there&#039;s quite a bit of people that have it installed already)... If you&#039;re interested, send an email to johnny@johnnydebris.net.</description>
