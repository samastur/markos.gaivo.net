		<description>@Víðir You are correct. As http://2014.djangocon.eu//news/ makes clear everything will be included in the price of the ticket.</description>

		<description>Hopefully everything will be in English.

My experience with conferences in France has been that often things are very difficult if you don&#039;t read and speak French.</description>

		<description>PS. for FEMALES that is the MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION.
I am male, USA citizen.
NEVER, almost NEVER go to the Birds of Feather meetings
at Javits Center, NYC, NY, USA during the big conventions?

WHY??
it ends at 7:30 or 8pm IN THE DARK.  Hard to get a taxi.
Public Bus schedule sometimes is late (USA union driver?)

For two guys walking together and familiar with BIG CITY CRIME,
maybe OK.
For a single female walking at least TEN CITY BLOCKS to &#039;safety&#039;
is a CHALLENGE.

So, I take the American and drop him in Bulgaria for the
conference ---  wearing wet cotton pants in the MINUS DEGREE
CENTIGRADE temperature?

Supercomputer conference in Tampa, FL. Drinking at the open
bar sponsored by BIG NAME CORP. with the Danish, Sweden and
some british professor (definitely a bit drunk). but he was
older and maybe did not have to get to work tomorrow.

I am the only one who knows the area and I have a strong
flashlight... as we stumble our way to the bright lights of
the big HOTEL.  This is NOT ORLANDO, FL or Miami, FL - getting
a taxi or limo IS THE PROBLEM. (and being the USA.. perhaps
avoiding seafood poisoning or food allergy items..)</description>

		<description>THIS IS A COMMON Organizational Anti-Pattern and key problem/challenge.

Why?
This professional engineering organization is &#039;stacked&#039;
in favor of BIG CORP, sometimes &#039;marketing evangelists&#039;
and other &#039;academics.&#039;  Same with Software Orgs.

1.)it is not easy running conferences and there are fewer
and fewer volunteers
2.)USA NYC despite HIGH EFFORT, even I found it difficult
and I almost ALWAYS resisted the temptation to &#039;get friends
and company colleagues&#039; to join the officers and volunteers.

3.)THERE MUST BE &#039;sliding scale&#039;, accomodations and even
special &#039;scholarships&#039;, etc.  Sure, it is easy for me with
a standard job (at that time), plenty of interest and even
friends with empty, cheap apartments in New York City, NY
USA.  But it is hard for FOREIGNERS...

4.)Why are not there more females?  Afraid of the BIG CITY
and crime?  Jobs pays a lot less than comparable males?  likely
true.  Afraid of social networking parties that have OPEN BAR
and just drinking and wildness?  Alas, somewhat true...

5.)There must be higher emphasis on the NEW ERA of virtual
conferences and also on &#039;small impromptu and agile meetings&#039;
at local cities.

6.)let us not get started about the AMERICAN english.. or
French Language, etc.  The only languages of importance are
SHELL, PYTHON and Haskell perhaps in that order.... IMHO in my
humble opinion - real math helps a lot, also.

THANK YOU for helping with the discussion.

7.)THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY conferences spread out with too
few participation.  Thus, perhaps there should be aggregation,
multiple conferences - in the same area. and even close timed
sequential conferences (big trade show... then overlapping
is the DJANGO, etc.

8.)it is easy to pick out the IBM conferences (yes I have
been there and done that).  Luxury hotel. Orlando, FL, USA
with plenty of activities for &#039;families - children, etc.&#039;
Yes, I have gone to Disneyworld a long time ago...  Just like
the lawyers always meet in Hawaii, USA or ??? with plenty of
golf course activities....

9.)the conference is the HUMAN TOUCH so needed in todays
VIRTUAL REALITY WORLD. Where one spends an average of 11.5 hours
per day ON THE COMPUTER in the &#039;MATRIX&#039; - see the Matrix Trilogy
movie - ALL THE TIME...

10.)Even soft soccer ball - football and &#039;party games&#039; and
even xkcd joke hour should and MUST BE part of the fabric of
conferences.  

11.)sometimes the cheapest places are colleges and Universities.
REMEMBER, the middle age (over five years of REAL job experience
ARE THE KEY.

Conclusion:  the time I spent on &#039;organizing&#039;, meeting with
fellow brothers and sisters GLOBALLY was time I did not spend
on the usual &#039;wild parties&#039;, drinking, gambling, big sports
American Football, endless hours playing biliards/pool...

Oh, amazing.. I have enjoyed working on my car (as an amateur)
and it is amazing how many SOFTWARE GENIUSES and even WOMEN
know little or nothing about CARS.

PPS. in the USA, the reason for many car accidents during the
ice and snow storms, is that &#039;driver education is low.&#039;  Yes,
I AM BORN IN THE USA.
In the airport parking lots and on the hills, spin the wheels
and create ice and well as burning out the transmission!
The heat creates ice ruts and dangerous driving conditions
IN THE CITIES of the USA.

I have driven a &#039;normal, old age car.&#039;  Rear wheel, so I
carry 200 pounds of sand/kitty litter over the real wheels
and the sand can be used to cover ice. ...

THE SEGREGATION, emphasis on &#039;commercialism&#039;; overemphasis
on GLOBALISM. rise of CORPORATIZATION - sponsorship of conferences  (of course IBM sponsors LINUX...) and other
&#039;closed door officer meetings - completely private) seem
to be

TRENDS in the non-profit, organizations and &#039;open association&#039;
organizations

PPS. presenting a paper or new findings, but not a FULL PROFESSOR?  Too bad you come from a small country like Tesla
or from ??? Greece.  IT IS HARD FOR YOU TO GO TO THE MEETINGS
IN PERSON.

This is not a small thing.... As head or Chairman or director
or president? of small org... the newspaper or heavens forbid
even TV CHANNEL can call at any time.  Your obscure &#039;blog&#039;
will remain an &#039;obscure&#039; and lost in the noise of the internet
blog????

		<description>As I read the current page of DjangoCon Europe, the  accommodations will be included in the ticket, but that might be just my interpretation. Non the less the current page is not final, as there is no way of buying tickets, reading about the program or anything else than that the conference is going to be on an island. So slow your horses and see how it all will evolve :)

In essence I agree with your main point though. Conferences should not become something that is a luxury - it should be available for everyone!</description>
