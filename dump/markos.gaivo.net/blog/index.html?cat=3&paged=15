			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I have finally upgraded my blog from 1.5 to 2.5.1, which went quite smoothly. If I knew it was going to be this easy, I would have done it a long time ago and save myself some work. I had no idea so much crap was secretly posted to the blog and if you find more or anything else that has stopped working, please let me know.</p>
<p>I would also welcome a tip from fellow wordpress users on how to turn rich-text editing on. It&#8217;s hard to imagine that it simply doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Yesterday was my last working day at my <a href="http://www.noovo.com/">current job</a>. I will start working at <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/">Zemanta</a> next Friday, where I will take over from <a href="http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog/" title="Jure's blog">Jure</a> as a head of front-end development. I really admire what Jure and his team have done so far and it will be a real challenge to keep up with his tempo. I&#8217;m also looking forward to solving problems that will make our extension, which I&#8217;m sure you already have, even more friendly and useful. Hopefully some of those problems will result in content on this blog that is worth reading.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have few days of vacation that will hopefully be spent on resting and cleaning up various tasks that pilled up in last few months.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=245" rel="bookmark">Suing myself</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>End of December is a time when I usually try to take stock of year behind and create semi-plausible goals for upcoming year. I didn&#8217;t used to do this until some day, a few years ago, I noticed that my twenties were gone. Since then it has become a habit that has served me well.</p>
<p>My biggest achievement this year is successfully suing myself. If this sounds ridiculous, it&#8217;s because it is. It would take too long to explain why I came to do this, but it goes to show how far you sometimes have to go to please some bureaucrat.</p>
<p>I worked a lot, to the point of postponing all my last years plans and didn&#8217;t get much in return. I honestly can&#8217;t say I learned a lot and I achieved even less of what I&#8217;m proud of. This year has simply been a professional disappointment that I have no intention of repeating again.</p>
<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t just wake up and discover my failures and failings. They&#8217;ve been apparent to me for a while and I spent a large part of last few months thinking about what interests me and what I want, can and will try to do. I tried to form my <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">personal research agenda</a>, but failing to get specific enough I have decided to spend next year learning about and exploring my areas of interest and see what I can come up with.</p>
<p>Creating content, while popular, still feels awkward and limited. As a <a href="http://www.lego.com" title="Greatest toys ever">LEGO</a> fan since childhood I want to see if I can come up with a set of metaphors and building blocks that yield great power of expression. The point isn&#8217;t a tool for a perfect expression of an idea as much as it is an adequate expression of most ideas. Polishing can and should come later.</p>
<p>I got Beautiful Evidence by <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> a few days ago and it&#8217;s an astonishing book covering another topic I feel needs more (of my) attention. When we manage to create something, we often fail to present our ideas properly. Partly it&#8217;s our fault since we can&#8217;t help ourselves not to rely on forms and traditions that came before web. It&#8217;s also our tools fault. When all you have is a blog, everything has to be squeezed onto a timeline.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re over-focusing on primary creations. As a reader I&#8217;m usually quite limited in what I can do with a piece. These days I can make a vague statement with voting or less vague one with a comment. I may also forward a find, but that&#8217;s about it. My actions are by and large limited to statements about a piece instead of interacting directly with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure none of above mentioned problems is new or unexplored. Smart people out there have certainly done wonderful stuff I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. Any pointers are always welcome. So next year I&#8217;ll work less, learn more (about it) and spend time playing with ideas that might appear. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have something to show in year&#8217;s time. Who knows, with a bit of luck I might even have something useful.</p>
<p>But before I leave, let me wish everyone merry holidays and a happy new year.</p>
