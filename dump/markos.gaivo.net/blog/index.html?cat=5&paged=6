			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Recently, for a moment, I couldn&#8217;t imagine myself working on web in ten years time. Since I am quite passionate about it and its development, the obvious question was why?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to be a web developer anymore?</p>
<p>Popularity of Facebook comes to mind. It is no secret that I am not a fan of <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> and similar networks. Yet I do have an account there and on some of its brethren. By the way, my Facebook account is for testing purposes, so if I haven&#8217;t befriended you, it almost certainly wasn&#8217;t personal.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Facebook and ilk are easy to criticize. Anything of that size will certainly gain much to be critical about. I also sometimes feel nostalgic about old web, before the gold rush of last millennium. That too probably says more about my age than anything else.</p>
<p>After some pondering I came to conclusion that I am longing for a sense of openness, equality and control I used to have. Few of us had our own server, but in principle with investment of little time and a bit more money, you could run all services that mattered.</p>
<p>Few actually did, since on the whole we didn&#8217;t do much. We do more now, some of which we don&#8217;t want public. I may not like Facebook&#8217;s walled garden of information, but I would have to be mad to argue for open access to all that private information. Even with existing restrictions in place people tend to trip and reveal? information to unintended audience.</p>
<p>If sharing our lives is what we want to do, which clearly is the case, then rise of brokers like Facebook feels as an unavoidable consequence. However that doesn&#8217;t mean natural development of a domineering agent should also be welcomed.</p>
<p>If at some point Facebook becomes a conduit for most of our digital lives, what happens if they revoke our account? To whom can we appeal? Who has access to the history of all our actions and what happens to it if we do decide to leave? Is it ever really gone? How do we know that our answers to this questions are true?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a clich? that technology is changing societies faster then they are able to adapt. It is a clich?, but that doesn&#8217;t make it wrong. We are changing long before we are able to understand what those changes will bring down the road. It can be argued either way, but it is your outlook on world that will largely form your opinion on desirability of end result.</p>
<p>I am not an optimist.</p>
<p>I like building things and I enjoy it even more when others use them too. I am sometimes lazy and perpetually busy, so I avoid building things which not even I asked for. I always tried to incorporate a reasonable amount of security in services I have built, but I have never added transparency and accountability to the system without outside pressure. I don&#8217;t know many who would and that pressure tends to come from legal requirements. It&#8217;s a subject too dull to care about without painful personal experience.</p>
<p>Another reason for uneasiness comes from the other side of web connection &#8211; web browsers. Last few years have brought an incredible amount of development and most of us aren&#8217;t well acquainted with new technologies yet. <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML 5" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5">HTML5</a>, CSS3 and Javascript will trounce Flash and Silverlight, right?</p>
<p>They might, but they all might not matter. Two raising trends I find interesting are <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile Web" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web">mobile web</a> access and mobile application platforms.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="iPhone" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> have more than 100 000 applications between them and my impression of these ecosystems is that many of them are not much more than platform specific clients to web services. Even if most of them might not have much to do with web (games, books&#8230;), it&#8217;s not difficult to imagine a future, where most of us would access web through mobile devices and developing native clients for a new service would have a priority over access through browser.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say this would necessarily be a bad thing, since web development can be quite messy and frustrating. It probably would be less egalitarian and less sharing environment and I would certainly miss that.</p>
<p>At the end of this long self-indulgent post I confess I have no answers. I barely have questions and I had to write this far to get to them. It is for me the most introspective part of the year, so I might be thinking about a non-issue. Time will tell. Eventually.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Now that Mini Seedcamp in Ljubljana is behind me (an event that might warrant its own post), I finally have some time to write about <a href="http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/FrontPage">Open Hack 2009</a>. I&#8217;m sorry to say to those who didn&#8217;t go that this might have been the biggest mistake you&#8217;ll do this year. It was indeed awesome. Before I go on I would also like to thank people at Yahoo for really pulling no stops in making it great and to everyone who came, for being inspiring, helpful and generally fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> and I made two hacks, a website <a href="http://guesswhatthisis.appspot.com/">GuessWhatThisIs</a> based on an idea we brought to event (but no code), and a game <a href="http://friedcell.net/geopong/">GeoPong</a> that Fry thought of in wee hours of Sunday. GeoPong, best described as &#8220;<a title="Link to quote" href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/05/11/open-hack-london-2009-my-presentation-and-quick-review/">a quite irrelevant but lovely hack</a>&#8220;, doesn&#8217;t always work great (especially on non-FF browsers), nevertheless I am still amazed that we managed to build both, because we essentially did GuessWhatThisIs twice. Wifi didn&#8217;t work until later in the evening, so we built first version of the site with pieces of software we had on our machines an educated guess about APIs we needed but couldn&#8217;t access.</p>
<p>Event was thoroughly documented on Flickr, Twitter and plethora of other websites, so I won&#8217;t dwell much on that. Instead I&#8217;ll mention couple of observations that albeit not new, I still found interesting.</p>
<p>First one is that team is absolutely everything. You can certainly do interesting stuff alone, but things really start happening if you have a good team. Working with talented and fun people mean ideas get fleshed out sooner, there&#8217;s little coordination and more things get done. If on top they are like Fry, who like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell_Bunny">Duracell Bunny</a> just seems to keep going, you can finish projects you certainly would not otherwise.</p>
<p>Hackday also provided another proof that all-nighters as development method are an idiotic idea. Most hackers, who certainly didn&#8217;t lack enthusiasm, fell asleep at some point during the night and those, like us, who didn&#8217;t, slowly fried our brains. Development slowed down to a glacial speed, code written was frankly embarassing and help was needed to resolve most basic problems. We spent more than 4 hours on GeoPong which normally shouldn&#8217;t take us more than half of one. Even worse from efficiency point of view was that Monday was gone too. All-nighter can be a fun thing to do once in a while, but it is really a crappy way to run a business.</p>
<p>At the end a small advice to organizers for next European event, on which I hope we won&#8217;t have to wait another two years. Try putting as much documentation and libraries on USB key as you can, so in case of wifi not working, we can still program with them instead of falling back to what we already intimately know or have on our machines.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=313" rel="bookmark">IE6 &#8211; hope of web standards</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I often find myself in a room with web developers and at least one of them proclaiming that IE6 sucks because it doesn&#8217;t support web standards while others nod in agreement.</p>
<p>This has bothered me enough to contemplate having a talk at <a href="http://www.barcamp.si/">BarCamp Ljubljana</a>. I didn&#8217;t, but this is what I would say.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 6" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</a> was released on 27th August 2001, when twin towers were still standing in NY.</p>
<p>7 years is a long time to remember, but what did we work with back then? There was no <a class="zem_slink" title="Safari (web browser)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and Firefox was still in its infacy, far from 1.0 release coming 3 years later. It was changing so often most developers simply ignored it. Opera was at version 5 (version 6 came out in November of that year) and I am sure I am not alone in remembering how awful it was at least until version 7 in 2003. <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla" rel="homepage" href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> was at version 0.6 and although showing great promise, IE6 definitely was the browser we hoped others would match.</p>
<p>Back then no browser supported CSS2 in a meaningful capacity. Opera had the best support for CSS until then, but IE6 surpassed it. It didn&#8217;t support DOM Level 2, which was standardized only 4 months before first beta of IE6. Good excuse not available anymore to <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 7" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">IE7</a> and IE8. Apart from that it supported more or less everything web developer could want back then and then some. IE6 problem isn&#8217;t so much that it didn&#8217;t support standards of its time as it is that it doesn&#8217;t support standards of today.</p>
<p>So why the hostility?</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Lancia Delta" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta">Lancia Delta Integrale</a>, which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don&#8217;t hear them go around complaining how it doesn&#8217;t meet standards of todays cars.</p>
<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve said, 7 years is a long time and most web developers are not old gits like me, so the historic context isn&#8217;t there. We also have to live with its real shortcomings today. But I think there&#8217;s more to this.</p>
<p>Complaining about IE6 standards deficiencies is declaring who you are and where you stand. It&#8217;s a simple and very recognizable way of declaring you are a member of web-standards tribe. IE6 bitching has at least as much to do with proclaimer as with proclamation&#8217;s subject. Trashing IE6 isn&#8217;t so much talking about the browser as it is talking about you.</p>
<p>However it is not unreasonable to ask why IE6 doesn&#8217;t better support standards that were released or updated after its initial release.</p>
<p>Certainly more could be done through software updates, but are standards themselves forward looking in a way that would avoid updating browser internals with every new version of a particular standard?</p>
<p>I am quite certain that this isn&#8217;t always possible. I don&#8217;t see how you could add a video object from <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML 5" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5">HTML5</a> to a browser without explicit support from browser&#8217;s developers. But not all changes are such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5">John Allsopp</a> has recently pointed out.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about HTML5. It&#8217;s bringing much needed new capabilities and lots of goodies, but I also think <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/15/Grandiosity">Sam Ruby</a> has a point. New, simple, <a class="zem_slink" title="Document Type Declaration" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration">DOCTYPE</a> is reduced to a switch between standards and <a class="zem_slink" title="Quirks mode" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode">quirks mode</a> and unless it will become more complicated in later revisions, it won&#8217;t offer an easy way to distinguish between HTML5 documents and other HTML versions. This isn&#8217;t a particular problem if newer revisions will be backwards compatible with older, but this isn&#8217;t true even of HTML5. Why would we think this is the last version where we will make a major misstep that needs backwards-incompatible correction?</p>
<p>There are other things I don&#8217;t like about HTML5, but if I would have to pick one thing I would like to see changed, is to make it more extendable.</p>
<p>To sum it up, IE6 is indeed a problem in todays development, but it&#8217;s also at least at fault for this. It was an excellent browser when it came out and is remarkably solid one for software so old. There are many reasons, completely untouched in this post, why its users don&#8217;t migrate to something newer, but we, web developers, are also to blame, because we tend to standardize only current practice and leave few doors open for future development which invariably comes.</p>
