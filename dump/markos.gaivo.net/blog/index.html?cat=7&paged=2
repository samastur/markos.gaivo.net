			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I recently came back from Berlin, where I publicly asked <a title="John's homepage" href="http://john.jubjubs.net/">John Lily</a> why haven&#8217;t they integrated <a class="zem_slink" title="Greasemonkey" rel="homepage" href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> into <a class="zem_slink" title="Firefox" rel="homepage" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. Wrong question can hardly lead to right answer. What I really wanted to know was:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla" rel="homepage" href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> integrate Greasemonkey-LIKE functionality in a browser?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Browser is at the farthest reach of web creators. It&#8217;s them who decide how a page will look like when it gets loaded and what visitors will be able to do with it. User actions that were not anticipated by page designers are limited to printing a page, tweaking its display a bit with user style sheets, seeing its source and copying text elsewhere.</p>
<p>Browser is also an application that is loaded on someone&#8217;s computer and belongs to him, as much as software can belong to somebody in EULA-infested world. Not every browser is equal, but pretty much all of them limit what you can do with page (beyond its creators intentions)Â  to above actions. The real question than for me becomes:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;To whom does a browser belong to?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One reason why I love Greasemonkey is that it enabled me to fix and change pages that I find lacking. Not every page has navigation where it should be and lots of them display parts of text in illegibly small letters. It can also help me plug different services together. It is indeed geeky, as Brady Forrest observed, but useful implementation doesn&#8217;t need to be. I find <a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">Platypus extension</a> a good first step to how a browser could further empower its users in customizing pages even further to their needs.</p>
<p>I thought about downsides to this since Thursday and I&#8217;m failing to find anything substantial.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been writing less lately, which had little to do with summer laziness and more with me thinking about publishing on the web.</p>
<p>Many have said that Internet (or Web) is not a television, but neither is it a magazine or a book. Yet I find myself again and again leaning on preconceptions picked up from my favorite medium. So this summer has been spent exploring my preconceived notions and trying to find out which of them still make sense on the web and how to tackle those which don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And the result of this exploration? I still don&#8217;t like WordPress, so I might go about writing my own publishing platform which would offer me an opportunity to test some of newfound ideas. Or I won&#8217;t, recognizing vast amount of time needed and I&#8217;ll end up only writing an article or two. But what I&#8217;m certain I will do is write less.</p>
<p>In a world where every monkey can publish so almost every one of us eventually does restraint is a virtue. There were too many posts that neither benefited me nor those who came across them. Maybe I won&#8217;t change the signal-noise ratio, but I will put less crap out there in absolute terms.</p>
<p>Related to all these thinking is a recent announcement of <a href="http://hyperscope.org/">HyperScope</a>. Doug Engelbart&#8217;s vision of <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augment-132082.opml">Open Hyperdocument System</a> (link may not work in every browser) has been a source of many ideas this summer and it&#8217;s certainly nice to finally have available a system to test at least some of them.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p><em><strong>Update 6.8.2009:</strong> This post is old and somewhat obsolete, but has been kept alive by commentators. Hence I posted an updated version of the script in comments.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Fry</a> recently mentioned a TEXTAREA improvement he found. As you type your text in the box, it grows in length as needed to avoid having to deal with scroll bars.</p>
<p>I liked the idea and went to create my own version. Making it work in Internet Explorer and Firefox was literally a matter of seconds. All you really need to do is compare elements <em>clientHeight</em> with its <em>scrollHeight</em> on key presses and increment <em>rows</em> attribute when former is smaller than later.</p>
<p>But supporting Opera and Safari has proven to be an insurmountable task for now. They simply don&#8217;t seem to update any property that could reliably be used for measuring the height of the text (but would love to be proven wrong).</p>
<p>You can try a <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/examples/growtextarea/index.html">demo</a>, which also doubles as a test environment for reading interesting attributes on the fly (updates are done with mouse over input box).</p>
<p>Random bits of observation:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>scrollHeight</em> is always bigger than <em>clientHeight</em> in Opera. Hence the need to ignore it using its unique fingerprint.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t try to work out the length of the text by trying to count the number of lines (using <em>\n</em>) and the length of each of them. Proportional fonts prevent any such reasonable guess.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t try to limit the growth of the box to the boundaries of the screen. I find page scroll bars the least annoying when scroll bars can&#8217;t be avoided. It&#8217;s a personal choice though.</li>
</ul>
