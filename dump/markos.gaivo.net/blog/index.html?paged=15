			<div class="post-text">
				<p>This is why you should never promise a delivery date. Days promised in my previous post stretched to few weeks because of unexpected work. ?Still, here it is, a list of books I read last year together with my thoughts on them. Since this is the second time I am doing this, I can say it is an annual event that you can, but won&#8217;t, look forward to.</p>
<p>I was wrong thinking my plan was to read 30 books. I actually planned to read 25 and while I did this, it is obvious I haven&#8217;t actually met my goal. I expected a low count on account of thick books I planned to read and yet a cursory glance over my list shows that A LOT of them were very short (which mind you doesn&#8217;t mean short on value).</p>
<p>Like last year I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. Alas bold is nowhere to be seen. Changing typeface of my blog robbed me of its bold font (for now). So do buy <em>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, The Crusades through Arab Eyes, The Absence of War, Too Loud a Solitude</em> and <em>The Pursuit of Glory</em>. Your soul will thank you for this.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of another book.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483">Coders At Work</a> by Peter Seibel. Fascinating look into titans of programming, but you probably have to be a programmer to enjoy reading it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802715354?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802715354">The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher</a> by Kate Summerscale</strong>. Amazing book. An intriguing never solved crime gets well researched to the point where it can present a plausible explanation of what happened. Also well written, so it&#8217;s hard to imagine being bored.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714838128?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0714838128">A Smile in the Mind</a> by Beryl McAlhone, David Stuart. A compendium of different ways in which design can delight us. It&#8217;s a topic that can&#8217;t be distilled in a how-to, but it does come close.</li>
<li>Fixed to Flexible: Four Simple Lessons about Cost, Price, Margin and The Options Available to The 21st Century Business by Todd Sattersten. An ebook I forgotten and hence can&#8217;t judge.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292">Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems</a> by Steve Krug. His first book is legendary. Second probably won&#8217;t be, but it&#8217;s still a very good (and quick) read if you want to learn effective usability testing on cheap.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0907259235?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0907259235">Designing books: practice and theory</a> by Jost Hochuli, Robin Kinross. A book about book design from a long time practitioner. Great read for us who are into that sort of thing and don&#8217;t disdain swiss design, but it&#8217;s likely boring to everyone else.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321643380?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321643380">Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design</a> by Dan Cederholm. Dan shows how you can use CSS3 today to progressively improve pages. Not quite the same approach as Andy Clarke&#8217;s (missing because I read it this year), but they both persuasively teach you to do more today.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805208984?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805208984">The Crusades through Arab Eyes</a> by Amin Maalouf</strong>. Title really says all. I started reading this one together with comprehensive tome from western PoV (which I plan to finish in 2011). I can recommend it even to those, who don&#8217;t have a particular interest in crusades.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596518579?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596518579">The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources</a> by John Allspaw. A great first step into domain of capacity planning. Get it even if you only suspect you might need this knowledge.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0571197515">Arcadia</a> by <a class="zem_slink" title="Tom Stoppard" rel="myspaceeverything" href="http://www.myspace.com/everything/tom-stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>. This and next 4 plays were actually in one book and I&#8217;ve seen a few of them on stage. Loved every one of them, each of them being a delight for mind.</li>

<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-098-street-fighting-mathematics-january-iap-2008/readings/sf_math.pdf">Street Fighting Mathematics</a> by Sanjoy Mahajan. More involved, but also more general approaches to getting fairly accurate estimates than in Mind Performance Hacks</li>
<li>Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto. Don&#8217;t know what to think of it, except that translation seems dubious.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571170714?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0571170714">The Absence of War</a> by David Hare</strong>. Great political drama that is still relevant.</li>

Liked it a lot, but still having a feeling that I missed a lot by not understanding untranslated Spanish parts.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061433047?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061433047">I Shall Wear Midnight</a> by Terry Pratchett. Liked it, but I might have liked it more (or less) if I wasn&#8217;t a fan who read almost everything written by Terry.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156904586?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0156904586">Too Loud a Solitude</a> by Bohumil Hrabal</strong>. Everything reviewers said: short, eccentric, playful and&#8230;a must read.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387356?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307387356">Master of Shadows: The Secret Diplomatic Career of the Painter Peter Paul Rubens</a> by Mark Lamster. Insightful and often surprising even for us who knew about his second career.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF4APO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001LF4APO">The Pursuit of Glory</a> by Tim Blanning</strong>. Could be the best history book I&#8217;ve ever read and its lingering effect on me might make it also one of most?influential.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883513006?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1883513006">Costa Rica: A Traveler&#8217;s Literary Companion</a> edited by Barbara Ras. I planned to read this while we travelled around Costa Rica, but failed. I read most of it during our last days on the trip and on our way home. Uneven, with some stories quite good while others resulting in &#8220;huh?&#8221;, but you do see country differently and I would recommend it to all who plan to travel there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also discovered <a href="http://www.granta.com/">Granta</a>, a really great literary magazine through which you can discover new authors or simply authors you don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p>At the end I would like to mention a book I read this year, so it&#8217;s not on the list, but which I find too important to ignore for a year. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069884">Eating Animals</a> by Jonathan Safran Foer. If you care what you eat and especially if that involves meat, you ought to read it. It&#8217;s well researched and even better written book that will inform you what &#8220;western&#8221; meat production means these days. I don&#8217;t think I can recommend it enough.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I returned from <a class="zem_slink" title="Costa Rica" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a> two days ago after a month spent there. It&#8217;s probably one of few places where you can have an amazing time even though it rains on you regularly and I wish I wasn&#8217;t back yet. I expected lots of nature and friendly people (got plenty of both), but I had no idea you can be cold for so long just 9 degrees from equator ? a combination of exceptionally cold weather and spending lots of time at high altitude places instead of a beach.</p>
<p>But this is not a travel post. A year ago I wrote <a title="Last year's review" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=534">my yearly review</a> and it&#8217;s time to write a new one. Looking back at this year I feel disappointed. It wasn&#8217;t really a bad year, even less so if looking at it objectively, but the feeling is here nevertheless.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s been a year of good intentions going wrong. I eat almost exclusively plant based diet, but I contracted salmonella while making a cake for family and suffered through most unpleasant week in recent memory. My stint as <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>&#8216;s product guy ended after several months and I still have mixed feelings about the whole thing. I haven&#8217;t finished much of what I started, exception being <a title="HTML Lint homepage" href="http://lint.brihten.com/html/">HTML Lint</a>, which was mostly <a title="Fry's homepage" href="http://fry.si/outbreak/">Fry&#8217;s</a> work anyway.</p>
<p>I also learned and read less than I thought I would. Year hasn&#8217;t ended yet, but self-imposed goal of 30 books won&#8217;t be quite achieved. I did however managed to emit less CO<sub>2</sub> while travelling than last year.</p>
<p>I am more optimistic about next year. <a class="zem_slink" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">COP16</a> wasn&#8217;t utter failure like the previous one was. I think a public goal of 30 books read will be met. There are good reasons to be optimistic about personal projects and I&#8217;ll try to raise my chances by not announcing them just yet.</p>
<p>This is it. At the end a bit late, but not any less heartfelt happy holidays to everyone.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=615" rel="bookmark">Reading and travels</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>There is never enough time for hobbies, but I really wish I could read and travel more. I <a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=608">plan</a> to do both, but that in itself poses a problem.</p>
<p>It is hard enough to take the right books and enough of them on a month long trip, but being on the road for months if not years&#8230;Well, it might not break proverbial camel?s back, but it would probably break mine.</p>
<p>It would be easier if my relationship to books was more rational. I love physical books and I tend to read those I want to keep so I can reread whole or just parts of them later. No computer interface comes close to pleasure I get from browsing my library. ?Every copy I have can be lend and many are.</p>
<p>I also buy electronic computer related ?books, which I used to read on Nokia tablet, but have recently switched to an iPad. I buy electronic versions mainly because there is no reason to kill a tree for content that gets obsolete so quickly. Reading on iPad is not fun, but that?s all right since I am not reading those books to have it.</p>
<p>I can?t tell what bothers me, but I suspect it is either the glowing screen, its low pixel density or both. But highlighting passages of text, multiple bookmarks and having a ton of books with you at the same time has its benefits too. Especially if you are a student with tons of textbooks to handle (which I am not). iPad also has a great ratio between what you can do with it and its physicality ? you really appreciate small size and weight after you?ve carried your backpack for days).</p>
<p>I also tested Kindle and while reading on it indeed feels nicer (so maybe glow is to blame), it brings its own set of problems with it. I wanted to read a book about the ?<a class="zem_slink" title="The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0307353133">4 hour work week</a>, which seemed interesting enough to read, but not something I want to own. ?Yet Amazon?s DRM infested Kindle shops are territorially segregating me, even though I could get a physical copy shipped anywhere without problems. Knowing why that is doesn?t make it tolerable.</p>
<p>I could live with such e-crap if buying paper and electronic copies together would not cost significantly more than just buying one. Say 3 to 5 dollars. However it does ?and imagining why <sup>[<a href="#book-1">1</a>]</sup> again draws no sympathy from me.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.What do I want?</p>
<p>I?m not sure. Paper wouldn?t get us far. I would like to take less silicon with us, but two bookworms can?t be fed on one book. Maybe when we are far enough with our plans, a company like <a class="zem_slink" title="Pixel Qi" rel="homepage" href="http://www.pixelqi.com/">Pixel Qi</a> will perfected their screens to the point where we can get best of iPad and Kindle in one device and Amazon will start selling accessible bundles. I also wish my whole wish list would be accessible in electronic form, not less than half of it.</p>
<p>However I look at it, compromises will have to be made which means gadgets will eventually get bought. Hopefully by that time I?ll actually like reading on them.</p>
<ol style="margin-top:3em">
<li id="book-1">You could sell a copy that you got discounted and with that reduce publisher?s profit. ?I?m willing to ?bet though that ?those lost 5 dollars amount to more money than such paranoia saves.</li>
