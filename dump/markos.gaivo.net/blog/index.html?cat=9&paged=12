			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I used to be a part-time system administrator and have a few colleagues who still are. So I&#8217;m fairly used to regular complaints about (l)users and a delusional sense of self-importance. Yet, it&#8217;s still a rare week in which I&#8217;d read a bunch of articles (with comments) like <a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html">this one</a>  and had so many discussions about what and how should our users behave.</p>
<p>I think most comments were simply rubbish. You have no reason to complain as long as they are polite and not intentionally obstructive.</p>
<p>The thing I always admired about <a href="http://www.mobitel.si">Mobitel</a> is the way they treat their customers. It doesn&#8217;t matter how little do they know about phones, phone plans or even their own needs and desires, you can be sure that Mobitel&#8217;s personnel will take the time and energy necessary to explain, show and resolve whatever is needed. They certainly don&#8217;t expect me to come loaded with information and spend more of my time to save theirs.</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about plumbing and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a fact well known and obvious to every plumber I&#8217;ve met. But did they ever treat me like an idiot? No, because it&#8217;s understood that they have to know so I don&#8217;t have to. I simply can&#8217;t know everything and wouldn&#8217;t want to, because there are other, more important things that I should be doing. I might help with my answers to their questions, but it&#8217;s not really expected of me to do anything more than to show the problem.</p>
<p>I understand frustrations when dealing with too many problems and too little time. I also know that there&#8217;s always a small percentage of users who simply are assholes. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s ever acceptable to be impolite, but I understand it sometimes happens.</p>
<p>Life can be hard, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that our task is to provide a service, to serve our users and not the other way around. And if we have a problem doing this, it&#8217;s us who must resolve it not them. In fact, without them  &#8220;pests&#8221; there&#8217;s little need for what we provide. After all a perfectly configured and RFC compliant mail server is just a box of toxic waste without someone sending emails through it.</p>
<p>Some professions get this. As Woody Allen rightly pointed out, it really is a bitch to get a plumber (on Sunday).</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>When we designed <a href="http://www.marela.si">Marela</a>, we obviously wanted to make it as close to perfect as possible, but we paid even more attention than usual to words and language used, since I find bad copy consistently the most annoying element of web site design.</p>
<p>This might look odd coming from me. But not being a chef doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t enjoy or respect good cooking. So I read articles like <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/resurrect_your_writing_redeem_your_soul/">this one</a>, hope that more people would do the same and try to do my best. I think we&#8217;re doing alright so far; no doubt largely because there are enough capable and caring souls fixing after me my stupidity and sloppiness.</p>
<p>If the tone and words used influence how we feel and percept others in our daily communications, why is it so difficult to imagine that this is equaly true when communicating through a web site or user interface? It&#8217;s still communication.</p>
<p>And to make this post at least moderately useful, I give you a short and far from complete list of words used in tech industry and what they actually mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>technology:</strong> stuff that doesn&#8217;t quite work yet</li>
<li><strong>open:</strong> works with our stuff</li>
<li><strong>robust:</strong>  works with our stuff, will break with almost anything else</li>
<li><strong>quality:</strong> works most of the time</li>
<li><strong>dynamic:</strong> you have to be flexible</li>
<li><strong>proactive:</strong> active</li>
<li><strong>end user:</strong> user</li>
<li><strong>innovative:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>world class:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>leading:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>cheap:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>partnership:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>professional:</strong> give us lots of money</li>
<li><strong>any 3 or 4 letter acronym:</strong> we are smart &#38; give us lots of money</li>
</ul>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Learning to read was really a big deal for me. One of the things I discovered was that people have a great difficulty writing my name correctly. I&#8217;ve experienced it so many times by now that I find it neither surprising nor annoying.</p>
<p>This week was a bit special with higher frequency of errors than usual on account of my talk. First I became Marko Semastur. Then a day or so later Makro Samastur was in vogue, which it&#8217;ll remain to be until the subtitles on footage are changed. I find the tech <a href="http://www.insultmonger.com/swearing/mauritius.htm">pimp</a> connotation of Makro highly amusing, but not quite a T-shirt material.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend yesterday who&#8217;d like to put up a website displaying his work and sadly discovered that domain with his name is already taken. I suggested a use of simple to remember name, but I can&#8217;t say I persuaded even myself.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to know is how important do you think is your name or the name you choose for a company for your recognition and success?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going back and forth over this and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m any wiser.</p>
