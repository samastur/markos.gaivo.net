			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I spent a good part of last year studying things like marketing, pricing and so on, which are completely untechnical in nature, but very much essential for a success of any company. I&#8217;m far from being an expert in any of these fields, but every now and then I come across an example, that leaves me dumbfounded in its amazing stupidity. It seems like incompetence is limitless and some people receive quite a lot of money to show off theirs.</p>
<p>Practically every textbook I&#8217;ve read taught me that the basic approach to marketing is to have a clear message of what you&#8217;re offering and why this is beneficial to people you&#8217;re selling to. With enough repetition you might have a chance of making them remember you. I certainly don&#8217;t think this is the only way to do it, but it&#8217;s probably the most tried and tested method out there.</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a new fashion in Slovenia. Create ads that don&#8217;t tell you anything. I&#8217;m not thinking of weird ads that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a company or product they&#8217;re pushing. No, I mean ads with literally nothing on except a word like <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">IZI</a> (bastardized easy) or <a href="http://www.t-2.net">T-2</a>. I guess it might have been intriguing if it wasn&#8217;t so overused.</p>
<p>However, last example with izi really takes the cake. First there were ads showing either just izi or if you were lucky, also a link to <a href="http://www.naizi.si">naizi.si</a>. As already mentioned, they were ads for <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">izimobil</a>. Now, go look at the  <a href="http://www.naizi.si">site</a> and find anything that could point a visitor to <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">izimobil.si</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll buy you a beer, if you can do it in next 24 hours. Or any other beverage of your choice.</p>
<p>Back? I couldn&#8217;t do it either. It&#8217;s hard to imagine there isn&#8217;t one, but it&#8217;s certainly well hidden. &#8217;cause you know, people really want to dig around the site looking for what you&#8217;re about, right?</p>
<p>Their ad campaign has been expanded in last day or so as they came out with jumbo ads promoting izimobil more directly and they&#8217;re trying to do so with a slogan:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Prvi slovenski virtualni operater mobilne telefonije.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Or in English: <strong>&#8220;First slovenian virtual mobile operator.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p>Was that supposed to persuade me to do something? Does virtual mean they&#8217;re not real? Which part should register as something positive with me?</p>
<p>Apart from being almost meaningless, it&#8217;s also wrong, if being virtual alludes to using some <a href="http://www.mobitel.si">other company&#8217;s</a> mobile network. <a href="http://www.debitel.si/">Debitel</a> did it first, although not as a prepaid operator and I know of no one, who would find that fact alone appealing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying their ad campaign won&#8217;t have positive effects. Hell, you can get them by showing dancing bananas and pie fights, as long as you&#8217;re willing to spend enough money on it. But somehow I doubt it&#8217;s an economical way to market your product.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>After a bit less than a month, but enough traffic to give me an idea what to expect, I decided to remove Google ads. I earned a dollar. Well, almost anyway.</p>
<p>My decision to end it was made easier when I discovered this, where ads were supposed to be:<br />
<a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" title="Full size screenshot of search ads"><img src="http://markos.gaivo.net/images/searchads-small.gif" alt="Search ads?" width="370" height="65"  style="border: thin solid #666; margin: 5px;" /></a></p>
<p>Wtf?</p>
<p>I tried to follow Google&#8217;s advice. I picked the most successful formats (but also experimented with others), put them at premium places and choose colors that blend in. Result was a buck and a revelation that on my site even old-fashion banners would be more profitable.</p>
<p>I have no real explanation for disappointing results. Since I&#8217;m not fond of ads either, I stayed with number of ad boxes I felt most comfortable with (usually just one) and used only text ads. It&#8217;s possible that I&#8217;d have more luck with image ads, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter, since I dislike them enough that they wouldn&#8217;t be acceptable anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible and even probable, that the problem was with content of pages. I&#8217;ve certainly noticed what often seemed at best a poor match between displayed content and ads.</p>
<p>Sadly there weren&#8217;t enough clicks to merit a more involved analysis. Maybe some other time, when I have a new idea worth exploring and get better results.</p>
<p>What has been your experience with AdSense?</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>One of the downsides of running your own company is that you have to get familiar with things you could never care for and amazingly often make sense only to really twisted bureaucratic minds.</p>
<p>In Slovenia, if you collect personal information of any kind, you have to register such database 15 days before its first use with <a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/index.php?id=2243&amp;L=1">Inspectorate for Personal Data Protection</a>. I&#8217;m all in favor of laws protecting personal information and in general I think Slovenian laws are not too bad in that regard. But if inspectorate by their <a href="http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/porocila/poroc_ivop_2004.pdf">own words</a> rarely inspects cases that weren&#8217;t reported to them and all such inspections seem to be limited to state institutions, what good is such register than anyway? How does it protect anyone?</p>
<p>You can read online <a href="http://www2.gov.si/mp/katalogz.nsf/(wwwUpravljavci)?OpenView&amp;Count=30" title="Online register">a list</a> of companies that registered their databases together with a short summary of what kind of data they collect and what for. I&#8217;ve checked a company where I administered such database for two and a half years (never experienced an inspection of any kind) and it&#8217;s quite clear that no one actually checks if provided information is true or complete.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re left with is another meaningless obligation you have to fulfill. Preferably by sending them email with data AND a printed form (email only is not allowed). Nice. You can do more work so they don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>E-government Slovenian style.</p>
