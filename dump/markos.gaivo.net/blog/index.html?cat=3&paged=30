			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I was reading Roger Johansson&#8217;s blog and came to a <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/">post</a> about message quoting. It reminded me of something I wrote last time I observed a flamewar between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">top-posting</a> and inline-replies proponents. This is a rough translation from Slovene:</p>
<blockquote><p>
> Because it messes up the flow of reading.<br />
> > Why is replying about quotations annoying?</p>
<p>Could you please stop with that? I don&#8217;t mean just the author of this message, but the general attitude of forcing people to use one, true way of quoting.</p>
<p>Both approaches, a reply under a short quotation or a whole message about the previous one, have their place and choice should be based on current need. So it&#8217;s good to be aware of their consequences on resulting dialog.</p>
<p>Short quotations followed by replies are meaningful when lost context from clipped text doesn&#8217;t hurt understanding too much. This means they are useful mainly for short, fact-oriented answers to concrete questions.</p>
<p>They are more or less inappropriate for longer, more involved dialog because they transfer focus from whole text to particular sentences. Lost context just raises probability of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Endless threads, quarreling about insignificant issues, off-topic threads etc. are a normal and expected byproduct of such discussion. Even a cursory glance over
<list> archives proves this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much better for a dialog, if reply is placed above the message, but ONLY when it&#8217;s self-contained and meaningful even without the original message. Attached original is therefore at most a friendly reminder for forgetful minds.</p>
<p>Picking right form is a matter of personal judgment and hence a source of mistakes. But this certainly can&#8217;t be a reason to howl down somebody.
</list></blockquote>
<p>I still believe this is true. I find myself using inline replies more often than not, but I do use top-posting when occasions calls for it and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a lesser being for it.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I thought Harold Evans&#8217; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language">last column</a> was quite good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no shocking revelation that I&#8217;m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I&#8217;d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I&#8217;ve used for more than three decades.</p>
<p>However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I&#8217;m sure I still make mistakes like this.</p>
<p>I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there&#8217;s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you&#8217;re talking about and not well enough to actually do.</p>
<p>So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve changed a lot and a lot has changed for me, since I started my company. Among other I&#8217;ve became much more aware of the way businesses deal with me as a customer. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but it usually sucks beyond belief.</p>
<p>Customer relationship management.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard anyone with a successful marriage describing living his relationship as managing it. If you give it a name like this, you&#8217;re off in a wrong direction already. No wonder dealing with most companies for me has an appeal of a full-body wax depilation.</p>
<p>There are rare exceptions. One of them is Tomaž, a computer hardware dealer who can get you practically anything you need. All it takes is an email with a short description of what I&#8217;m looking for and in shortest time possible I get it delivered personally to my doorstep. There&#8217;s no unnecessary bureaucracy, no trying to sell me something I didn&#8217;t ask for and I get a good price. In short, it&#8217;s a great service that leaves me to focus on really important stuff. And Tomaž gets more business from me than he would probably otherwise.</p>
<p>Why is this so hard for others to learn?</p>
<p>By the way, if you need to buy computer hardware and you want to get a good price with as little fuss as possible, please let me know and I&#8217;ll send you his email address.</p>
