			<div class="post-text">
				<p>We visited a wonderful exhibition a few days ago about two failed Antarctica expeditions led by <a title="Robert Scott at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott">Scott</a> and <a title="Ernest Shackleton at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton">Shackleton</a>. I learned a lot, but what I keep thinking of are Frank Hurley&#8217;s glass plates.</p>
<p><a title="Frank Hurley at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hurley">Frank Hurley</a> was the official photographer on Shackleton&#8217;s <a title="More at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition">Trans-Antarctic expedition</a> (1914-1917). Shackleton and his crew encountered ice farther to the north then they expected and eventually got stuck in it. It is impossible to imagine how they felt when their efforts to free their ship Endurance proved unfruitful and had to spent arctic winter on it. Ship had to be abandoned by the end of October 1915 before surrounding ice crushed it. Crew then spent next few months on floating ice. They decided to seek safety on land which meant hauling what they needed by themselves and leaving everything else behind. Which brings us to Hurley&#8217;s plates.</p>
<p>These were early days of photography and equipment was larger than it is now, but even today&#8217;s gear for taking large format photographs is pretty big and heavy as are prints made with it. Hurley had two cameras, a large format one capturing images on glass plates and a smaller portable Kodak using film <sup><a id="glass-plates-1" href="#glass-plates-note-1">[1]</a></sup>. He made more than 500 images on plates which were too heavy to carry them all, but he managed to persuade Shackleton to pick and keep 120 or 150, depending on source <sup><a id="glass-plates-2" href="#glass-plates-note-2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Then he broke the rest.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find an explanation for his action in one of the most inhospitable places on earth where environment should soon enough destroy those plates without his help, but I think I know why he did it.</p>
<p>Expeditions were expensive and selling publishing rights for images made during trip was an important source of funding. Breaking plates ensured them that their images would be the only ones that could be printed. Breaking them was in essence an enforcement of copyright.</p>
<p>There is no moral to this story. It was doubtless a difficult decision in even more difficult situation. But it is hard to look at remaining images and not feel a real sense of loss. Such a waste!</p>
<p>If you are in London these days, then go and see this exhibition which you can find at <a href="http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/">Queen&#8217;s gallery</a> just next to Buckingham&#8217;s palace until April 14th. I bet you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Exhibition closed and my theory is wrong. As visitor pointed out (with Frank&#8217;s own words) plates were broken to remove temptation to return for them.</p>
<ol>
<li id="glass-plates-note-1">Kodak, one of pioneers of photography, recently abandoned making cameras to solely focus on their soon to be dead image printing business.<a href="#glass-plates-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="glass-plates-note-2">Hurley continued documenting their ordeal with Kodak. Resulting images are more grainy and less sharp, but equally fascinating document of what they all went through.<a href="#glass-plates-2">↩</a></li>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=918" rel="bookmark">On Tumblr</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p><strong>Warning: </strong>this whole post is not much else than a series of speculations and amateur psychoanalysis. If you can’t find fun in that, well, then start reading something else.</p>
<p>I started using <a title="Description of IRC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> almost two decades ago, soon after I came on Internet. I still do, but it’s now a very different experience mainly because today almost everyone is connected. When everyone is around, you tend to hang out largely with people you already know. Back then I chatted with faceless handles and what I found especially interesting were strong feelings and a sense of familiarity that developed between people who would never meet.</p>
<p>I thought of this recently again while discussing appeal of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and a <a title="Definition of neologism" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism">neologism</a> that I like — tumblrcrush. It wasn’t explained, but I understand it as having a crush like feeling provoked by a Tumblr blog.</p>
<p>I never heard of something like that related to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> although I am sure it happens. But I feel safe in hypothesizing that such visceral affection for a blog and by proxy for its creator happens more often on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Now, this is surprising on surface because so many Tumblr blogs look like nothing more than collages of other people’s stuff whereas old school blogs often have more what is disgustingly called original content and are more verbose — just like this one. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that writing at length about things that interest me would reveal more about who I am then things I collect. After all I am more likely to divulge facts about me through my own writing than through other people’s work.</p>
<p>However when I write, it’s not really me who does it. Writing, even when trying to avoid self-censorship (unsuccessfully), engages a different part of a brain than responding to an image or a passage of text. I write so I can think, but even when not, I don’t just type a <a title="Ulysses - an example of such work" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29">Joyce-like stream of consciousness</a>. I form sentences I would prefer to utter, but usually don’t.</p>
<p>The genius of Tumblr (even with some serious interface screw-ups) is that it makes it easy to republish found stuff <em>and</em> really inviting to do it. Those pieces shared and reshared are revealing exactly because they were created by others. They never had time to be distilled and redacted closer to our self-image because they weren’t selected to represent us. Instead they are mostly curated by finder’s emotional response and its those emotions, part of finder’s subconscious (soul), that sometimes touches us.</p>
<p>Because what does it really mean to know someone? We may admire intellect, but we relate to the person. We don’t know a person until we empathize with her and those small shared bits are conduits for feelings, not information.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t write long, elaborate posts on Tumblr. Many indeed do. Just like many use WordPress to post stuff they found in some web back-alley. But it is Tumblr’s whole fun (and) social experience — unlike a serious, CMS-like sterility of WordPress — that nudges you into a different behavior. In creating we are guided by our tools with what they suggest, not what they make possible.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=912" rel="bookmark">The books I read in 2011</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many years are necessary to call something annual, but three are probably enough. So here&#8217;s my annual list of books I read in 2011. I typed &#8220;this year&#8221; first. Obviously celebrating new year is not enough for my mind to completely switch and I&#8217;ll probably be in danger of writing 2011 where I shouldn&#8217;t for another fortnight or so.</p>
<p>This year I <a title="Why I stopped" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=664">stopped striving</a> to read a certain number of books and I&#8217;m happier for it. Looking at the list I am mostly happy with my choice of fiction and seriously question my choice of books related to my career. It&#8217;s not that books themselves would be that bad (most weren&#8217;t), but why on earth did I spent so much time reading things tangentially related to what I do?</p>
<p>I linked every book I liked and bolded those I heartily recommend. To safeguard from my tweaking of this blog&#8217;s theme, here are recommended spelled out: <em>Eating Animals, Herztier, Skylight </em>and<em> The Unfolding of Language</em>. I also want to specifically mention <em>Copper</em> and <em>Atlas of Remote Islands</em> both great in their own way which are not bolded but maybe they should be.</p>
<p>Last year’s disclaimer is also still valid. Most links point to Amazon  and include my affiliate ID meaning if you buy them after following  these links, I get few cents that might eventually lead to purchase of  another book. It was easier to copy this paragraph than fix my scripts that generate links to books, but I should probably do later. I promise to fix it for next year&#8217;s list, especially since I&#8217;ve never earned enough to buy even one book.</p>
<p>Without further ado here is the list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069884?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069884">Eating Animals</a> by Jonathan Safran Foer</strong>. Great book that you should read even if you have no plans to become a vegetarian (or vegan).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802119298?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802119298">The Cello Suites: J. S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a Baroque Masterpiece</a> by Eric Siblin. Who knew there is such a fascinating story behind cello suites and Eric tells it very well.</li>
<li><a href="http://fivesimplesteps.com/books/hardboiled-web-design">Hardboiled Web Design</a> by Andy Clarke. I wish I didn&#8217;t have to read word hardboiled so many times, but otherwise a must-own book for every web front-end developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060878134?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060878134">The Yacoubian Building</a> by Alaa Al Aswany. I read this at the end of January, when Egypt was engulfed in protests against regime and it provided an excellent background to why protests were happening. A truly captivating look at modern Egypt society.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060575557?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060575557">Buying a Fishing Rod for my Grandfather</a> by Gao Xingjian. Six beautiful vignettes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375713247?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0375713247">Epitaph for a Spy</a> by Eric Ambler. I don&#8217;t read many mystery books, but I read this one with pleasure. It aged remarkably well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321687299?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321687299">Introducing HTML5</a> by Bruce Lawson, Remy Sharp. A good, hands-on introduction to HTML5 and related technologies that occasionally forgets to mention browser support and is already somewhat out of date. Luckily second edition is out (or should be soon).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014311820X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=014311820X">Atlas of Remote Islands</a> by Judith Schalansky. A beautiful book. A delightful way to spend a day reading about mostly unknown islands.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806027?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596806027">HTML5: Up and Running</a> by Mark Pilgrim. I read this one almost back to back with Introducing HTML5 and there is surprisingly little overlap between them. It can feel too geeky and repetitive in places, but it has best treatment of data-* I&#8217;ve seen so far.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144953662X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=144953662X">Life Nomadic</a> by Tynan. A book of anecdotes and lots of practical advices aimed at digital nomads, which has surprisingly large amount of useful tips for us who don&#8217;t travel as light or for as long.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810115972?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0810115972">Herztier</a> by Herta Mueller</strong>. Without a doubt one of the best books I read in years and also one of the most heart wrenching. Literature at its best.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571176127?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0571176127">Skylight</a> by David Hare</strong>. Great drama with amazing amount of substance. Probably not for you if you are politically right (wrong) leaning.</li>
<li><a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy">The Elements of Content Strategy</a> by Erin Kissane. Good overview which confirmed it&#8217;s not a problem I&#8217;d have. Or career I&#8217;d choose.</li>
<li>EffectiveUI by EffectiveUI. Overview with some concrete propositions written for audience that doesn&#8217;t include me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596809484/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596809484">97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</a> by Kevlin Henney. Mostly uncontroversial and insightful often enough to be worth at least a quick browse.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652269X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=059652269X">97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know</a> by Richard Monson-Haefel. Kind of like the previous one, only for software architects.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596801998/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596801998">Confessions of a Public Speaker</a> by Scott Berkun. A fun book with lots of good tips which still can&#8217;t make you a good speaker without practice.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449307116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449307116">Think Stats</a> by Allen B. Downey. I read this book too soon, before it was published. Content was promising, but code was sloppy and buggy. Most useful to (Python) programmers who want to learn basic statistics.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AH7GO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0056AH7GO">Dry Side Up</a> by Martin Ony. I know Martin so I may be biased, but I also don&#8217;t like travel literature. This is the book I would get if I wanted to know how it FEELS like to raft through Grand Canyon. Fun to read even if you don&#8217;t have such plans.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062011847/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062011847">Snuff</a> by Terry Pratchett. Felt a bit sentimental and certainly not among his best, but I nevertheless enjoyed it as I&#8217;m sure most fans will.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O8MVGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000O8MVGY">The Chains of Heaven: An Ethiopian Romance</a> by Philip Marsden. Interesting, insightful, fluid, but still travel literature. I liked it as much as I can like travel literature.</li>
<li>The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai. A rather uneven book that doesn&#8217;t quite live up to praise it received. Sometimes brilliant, often not, but almost always tragic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545098939/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0545098939">Copper</a> by Kazu Kibuishi. A melancholic comic about a boy and his dog that fits my temperament perfectly. Most, but not all, cartoons can be found on web, yet book is still worth buying.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805079076/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805079076">The Unfolding of Language</a> by Guy Deutscher</strong>. Fascinating and well-written book about how human languages did and might have developed. Can&#8217;t recommend highly enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608191664/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=devel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=160819166">23 Things They Don&#8217;t Tell You about Capitalism</a> by Ha-Joon Chang. A must read for free-market proponents and less so for well-read people. It contains some surprising information for everyone and is easy to read. I wish though there were more links to data in notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This year I plan to finish a few tomes I already started but for one reason or another put off. I find I read too much from &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; authors so I want to read even more books from, at least to me, less known places and cultures. Also more directly work-related books would be great too. Any recommendations of books you liked are most welcome.</p>
