				<p>I thought Harold Evans&#8217; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4252520.stm" title="Harold Evans talks about English language">last column</a> was quite good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no shocking revelation that I&#8217;m not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Slovenian; a fairly difficult language to master even for willing. Although my (mis)use of it leaves much to be desired, I&#8217;d like to think I have a better grasp of it than of English.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I happen to get into trouble because of a misunderstanding that is sometimes caused by as little as a subtly different perception of a word. Usually such problems can be easily spotted and rectified since nuances are much clearer to me in a language I&#8217;ve used for more than three decades.</p>
<p>However, I was less lucky when dealing with different cultures using English. One such occasion was using word hate improperly, as you might use it in Slovenian by implying a stronger disliking of something, but not an actual hate. I try not to transplant use of a word or a phrase between languages, but I&#8217;m sure I still make mistakes like this.</p>
<p>I also lost international friendships through years. Most of them probably because of my cultural ignorance and sometimes it seems the language we used came between us. I came to believe there&#8217;s a risk in knowing language well enough for people to assume you know what you&#8217;re talking about and not well enough to actually do.</p>
<p>So, does anybody have any personal language related horror stories to share?</p>

						<p>Hi Marcos</p>
<p>I struggle with the anglish language, I was born in Senneterre Quebec. I&#8217;m pure french as the english people say, I came to live in Ontario I was three years old and did not speak english at all.</p>
<p>When I was growing up we could not speak english inside our home but outside the home my parents didn&#8217;t mind. Why they did that is for us not to forget our birth language, we learned the english language by playing outside with kids in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>Throughout my years I gotten myself in many situations where my french interfered with properly speaking anglish. I think french for some reason&#8230; not known why then translate what I want to say in English, which does not translate the way it should be said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told all through my lifetime that I do not say sentences right, people tell me so and say what it should of been said, or wonder why I said that, most of the times people burst out into laughter.</p>
<p>Also it interferes with verbs so it does become a problem for the ones that don&#8217;t know me. People that knows me they re-phrase what the sentence to what it should of been and laugh at what I said.</p>
<p>I still struggling with the english language which is the prefered language to speak but still speak french fluently up to this day&#8230; so I can relay to you Marcos!!!</p>
<p>Have a great day</p>
