		<description>My two cents, just give up. Just like junk mail, spam is inevitable, and unfortunately a part of life :(

If you want to make things more difficult though, you could have a contact page, and a very easy machine-human test in order to get to the page with your email aggress, something like &quot;Click the green square to send me a message&quot; which could link to a perl script to either redirect to a mailto: link or a &quot;Try again&quot; page. If this were done with an old-school img map, the robot would need to hit the correct coordinates to spider the contact page... Just thoughts.</description>

		<description>Separate contacts page isn&#039;t always a solution and even when it is, it&#039;s not really a nice one, since at best it means nothing will get indexed.

You can see a weird, but readable representation of my email address (on my homepage) if you turn off Javascript. I use Javascript because the difficulty of emailing someone is inversely proportional to the number of people who&#039;ll do so.</description>

		<description>separate contacts page seems to be THE solution, but there are many spiders who don&#039;t use (ignore) robots.txt.

You could appeal to human intelligence and wrote your email in some weird way still readable to human willing to contact you:

your.name # domaain tld
or
your DOT name AT NOSPAM DOT domain DOT tld...</description>
