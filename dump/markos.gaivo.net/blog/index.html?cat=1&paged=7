				<p>Has anyone succeeded in getting a flash file to execute inside of (any) WYSIWYG in-browser editor?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t work for me and I can think of at least one reason why it shouldn&#8217;t (security leak), but has anyone done it anyway?</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=227" rel="bookmark">Google Gears Goodies</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>It&#8217;s an expected fact of a geek life that interesting technologies and gadgets appear when you don&#8217;t have either means or time to play with them. No surprise then that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html">Google Gears</a> was announced exactly at such a time for me. As you&#8217;ve probably read elsewhere, Google Gears is a browser extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer (with Safari coming up) which lets developers create web applications that can also run offline on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t the first company doing something like this. Adobe has Apollo, Microsoft is working on its own thing, Mozilla added support for offline storage in version 2 of the fox and there are some less well known attempts like Dojo&#8217;s. What makes it special are few things.</p>
<p>First, unlike Apollo or Firefox, it&#8217;s not a special environment and it&#8217;s as cross-browser and cross-platform as it gets these days. Google is also trying to build an industry support for this and Adobe already <a href="http://shebanation.com/2007/05/30/google-gears/">announced</a> it will support Gears API in Apollo. Same has <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/audible-ajax-episode-21-dojo-offline-on-google-gears">already been done</a> by Dojo Toolkit. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/05/30/19.06.10/#comments">an intention</a> to make it an open standard by submitting proposal to WHATWG/W3C (and hopefully them accepting it).</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t wait to play with WorkerPool API (which seems to be overlooked in all the excitement). Having a possibility of running time-intensive operations in a background without the fear of triggering &#8220;unresponsive script&#8221; dialog is a wish come true. Even though you can&#8217;t access objects <em>document</em> and <em>window</em> (and hence any part of the DOM). Reason for this is that background scripts don&#8217;t share any execution state and hence can&#8217;t all access unique objects like aforementioned ones.</p>
<p>This might limit usefulness of the API somewhat, but there are still plenty of uses that come to my mind. What also comes to my mind is a problem, that isn&#8217;t really technological. Web applications gave impression to public of being fairly safe to use even on public computers (which isn&#8217;t really true) and I fear many won&#8217;t understand that new tools may now store private data where they don&#8217;t expect or want them to.</p>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>People make mistakes and that&#8217;s why we log every error that happens on <a href="http://www.marela.si" title="Photo-sharing website">Marela</a> pages or its API. I imagine most services that care about quality do more or less the same, since it is a great way to find yet undiscovered bugs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an additional benefit when it comes to an API. You can also get an insight in what developers would like to do and how they go about doing it. With a bit of care you may even correct badly designed calls before they get too widely adopted.</p>
<p>What may not be as obvious is that not all calls are equal and some of them probably need more careful reporting. A good example would be failed authentication attempts.</p>
<p>Marela is one of services supported by <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3945">Fotofox</a>, a popular photo sharing Firefox add-on, which is great. However support for multiple different services invariably leads to a problem, where users send their usernames and passwords to the wrong site. We weren&#8217;t prepared for this and our first reaction was to simply religiously delete all such reports from our logs to prevent any possibility of an abuse.</p>
<p>I think this was wrong, so we changed it. Probably the best way is to record failed authentication attempts the way Unix systems do, by logging just username that was used in an attempt and its success, while ignoring provided password completely. This way we still obtain valuable information while protecting data that we clearly shouldn&#8217;t have access to.</p>
<p>This is of course just an example. My main point is that a sufficiently large API will have calls with different privacy needs and API designers should think carefully about what needs to be recorded in service logs and what mustn&#8217;t.</p>
