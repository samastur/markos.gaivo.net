				<p>It&#8217;s getting more and more horrible to travel around with planes. Senseless airport rules or those which benefit only airport employees can still get me angry even days after return home. These days I wouldn&#8217;t dare to change planes at Heathrow unless I had at least two hours to do so and would need at least 3 hours not to be nervous about it. Still, there&#8217;s a positive side to it. It makes coming through the home door a happier event.</p>
<p>Somehow I don&#8217;t mind the actual waiting at the airport. On our last trip we, my wife and I, waited several hours for our next flight which gave us ample time to sit in cafeterias and observe functioning of an airport.</p>
<p>We watched couple of men loading luggage on a plane and unsurprisingly they didn&#8217;t handle suitcases gently. Our fairly new samsonite is a witness that this is quite common and I don&#8217;t expect it to last for more than a few more years unless we reduce amount of traveling we do. Still, I was astonished to see how far they can throw big heavy suitcases. It certanly can&#8217;t be good for their backs.</p>
<p>Looking at flying luggage got me thinking. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if the whole process of loading and unloading bags could be mostly if not completely automated?</p>
<p>It could be done the same way as it was done with ship containers. Just standardize a few sizes in which all suitcases would come and build airplane cargo areas that take those sizes into an account. I believe you could handle most luggage completely automatically and use human gorillas only for pieces that don&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>You could also stimulate adoption with appropriate weight or pricing benefits for those who would use such luggage. This way we&#8217;d all win. Or is there something I&#8217;m missing?</p>

						<p>Even more people would loose their jobs?</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s bad argument, but still it is something that would come up in public debate around this.</p>

						<p>True, they would lose. But public debate involves people who get aggravated by those same procedures.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d expect they would get even less sympathy than police.</p>

						<p>Since I sell luggage for a living this caught my eye. Actually, most luggage does fall into fairly standardized sizes based on either weight or dimensions. It&#8217;s the devil in the details that causes problems, and passengers or airlines who try to take advantage of The System. What amazes me is how well The System actually does work, at least most of the time. Once again the great majority of bags do get to where they&#8217;re supposed to be going and in relatively good condition. The problem is the horror stories are repeated so often that they appear far larger than they are. The bottom line is simple.<br />
If passengers would read the rules and directions before they start packing or traveling, they wouldn&#8217;t have problems. But they don&#8217;t, so they do. Sigh&#8230;.</p>
