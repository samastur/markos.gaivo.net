			<div class="post-text">
				<p>December is running out of days fast and I still haven&#8217;t written my annual review of things I planned or did, intentionally or otherwise. I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a while, but couldn&#8217;t find words to express myself. Finally I gave up. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll succeed now, but I doubt more time would help.</p>
<p>For me this year has been absolutely wonderful. Coming to <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> meant I could work on interesting problems to improve a tool I use myself while collaborating with people I like and respect. I traveled to more conferences than ever before and generally learned a lot. I&#8217;m proud of my team&#8217;s achievements and of what we did as a company. It is indeed a privilege to have a gig like this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started a private project with a friend, which is coming along nicely. It shouldn&#8217;t be too long before we can show it to, well, everyone interested. Hopefully that means to many.</p>
<p>In all, 2008 was great for me and I don&#8217;t think 2009 will be worse.</p>
<p>Yet of late I&#8217;ve been feeling increasingly gloomy. This has remarkably little to do with economic crisis, influence of which we can already feel even if it&#8217;s yet to hit with full force. I won&#8217;t be traveling as much next year, but I planned to do less of it even before I knew there might be economic reasons to do so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been worrying about the state of our planet for years. Things weren&#8217;t getting better as quickly as I thought they should. In fact, they aren&#8217;t getting better at all, but I hoped we would turn and do what needs to be done when given last chance.</p>
<p>There are many things that are deeply wrong in this world. Slavery <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/slavery-worse-than-ever">is more widespread</a> than probably ever. We know we should reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in atmosphere, yet <a href="http://www.mnp.nl/en/publications/2008/GlobalCO2emissionsthrough2007.html">we do opposite</a>. Fisheries around world are rapidly <a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0918-hance_fish.html">collapsing</a> taking whole ecosystems with them. Glaciers <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/10/poznan-brazil-climate-change-environment">are receding</a> with probably disastrous effect on water supplies for millions of people. Rising world population will continue to negate any progress we may have. I <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7780040.stm">could go on</a>, but this list is depressing enough.</p>
<p>After all it&#8217;s not the scale or number of challenges that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7786910.stm">is dispiriting</a>. It&#8217;s our <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/12/greenpolitics-poznan">inability to act</a> decisively. We prefer compromises that set targets too low and then <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/richardblack/2008/12/when_targets_miss_the_point.html">fail to meet</a> them. There are 6.5 billion of us, but we are still unable to face real probability that this may be too many. I sometimes wonder how lives looked like in last days of civilizations long gone, most of them disappearing precisely because they taxed their environment too much. I hope I&#8217;m wrong and never find out.</p>
<p>I wished to end this post on a positive note, but I&#8217;m clearly failing. I do sincerely wish everyone happy holidays and the best of luck in next year. I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll need it.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=305" rel="bookmark">View unread in Gmail and move documents in Google Docs</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I use <a class="zem_slink" title="Gmail" rel="homepage" href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> mainly for reading mailing lists. I&#8217;m old-fashioned and prefer to have my email where I can control it, but otherwise I can&#8217;t fault Gmail much. I wish search worked better and until today I wished to have a folder with unread messages.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way around second problem for those, who can turn on Gmail lab features (which hosted domains can&#8217;t). Go to the Lab tab in settings and turn on Quicklinks. After that return to Inbox, type is:unread in search box and confirm.</p>
<p>When you get results view, just press Add Quick Link in Quick Links widget, pick a name you like and voila, you have a view which lists unread messages. It&#8217;s not perfect though. It won&#8217;t show you how many messages are unread and you can&#8217;t subscribe to it through <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Message Access Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a>.</p>
<p>The other thing that is not perfect is <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Docs" rel="homepage" href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, which I quite like. I did encounter a problem with it that is not important right now, but I imagine it might be in not too distant future.</p>
<p>How do you move documents between accounts?</p>
<p>What you can do is share the document with account you want it moved to and then delete it. If you are owner of this document, you will get a pop-up with a choice to transfer ownership before deletion. Again, it seems I can&#8217;t transfer it to a hosted domain account, so this trick is not only not obvious, but also doesn&#8217;t work all the time.</p>
<p>If there are better ways to accomplish above two things, then I would love to hear them.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems part of my post <a title="Labs for Google Apps" href="http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2008/12/labs-love-at-last">became untrue</a> even faster than usual.</p>
