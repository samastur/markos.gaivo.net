		<description>Hi Marcos

I struggle with the anglish language, I was born in Senneterre Quebec. I&#039;m pure french as the english people say, I came to live in Ontario I was three years old and did not speak english at all.

When I was growing up we could not speak english inside our home but outside the home my parents didn&#039;t mind. Why they did that is for us not to forget our birth language, we learned the english language by playing outside with kids in my neighborhood.

Throughout my years I gotten myself in many situations where my french interfered with properly speaking anglish. I think french for some reason... not known why then translate what I want to say in English, which does not translate the way it should be said.

I&#039;ve been told all through my lifetime that I do not say sentences right, people tell me so and say what it should of been said, or wonder why I said that, most of the times people burst out into laughter.

Also it interferes with verbs so it does become a problem for the ones that don&#039;t know me. People that knows me they re-phrase what the sentence to what it should of been and laugh at what I said.

I still struggling with the english language which is the prefered language to speak but still speak french fluently up to this day... so I can relay to you Marcos!!!

Have a great day</description>
