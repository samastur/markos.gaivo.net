		<description>Email.si: system admins who can&#039;t handle network administration, programmers who don&#039;t know anything about graphics design and marketing department is a mail alias. Hello!

We had a designer for the first redesign, what... 5 years ago. The other &quot;designer&quot; just quit. I think that he designed a New Years greeting card and that was it. Heh.

Marko, obviously I&#039;m well aware of the current shortcomings of the design, but sometimes things just need to get done and &quot;clean Web 2.0&quot; way isn&#039;t a timely option for me. Yeah, it&#039;s just me, no one else.

I&#039;ll have to blog about our current status. But mostly: it sucks and we, programmers and admins, are trying to do something about it.</description>

		<description>Well, I have no doubts about your backend prowess, but the same can&#039;t be said about frontend stuff.

True, it&#039;s not as bad as above example or many other pages on slovenian web, but it&#039;s not good either. Nonsemantic use of tags, table-based layout, presentation not separated from content and so on are just a few of blemishes on them.

You should come to our meetings more often ;-)</description>
