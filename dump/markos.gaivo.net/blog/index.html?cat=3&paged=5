			<div class="post-text">
				<p>As a person with a somewhat unusual fondness for measuring and modelling my own behavior I should be a happy buyer of <a title="Jawbone's UP" href="https://jawbone.com/up">gadgets</a> for <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/one">collecting data</a> about myself and my environment. Yet so far I bought none, because they don&#8217;t seem to work <em>well</em> without (occasional) data sync with producer&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>I really shouldn&#8217;t have to explain privacy standpoint of this. Describing my life and immediate environment in detail to a bunch of people I have never met, some of whom don&#8217;t even work for the company yet and trusting all of them that they will not compromise it for as long as they will keep it is to me self-evidently moronic.</p>
<p>But I also avoid such hardware even when data in question might not be particularly sensitive. If I am paying for something to be manufactured, then I expect to own it. If a gadget depends on an external service to be useful, then I am really only leasing it. Services disappear for many reasons and it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to rely on their availability unless you can host them yourself. I loath ads, but paying for a service is not a guarantee for its continuing presence either.</p>
<p>I am not against functionality that reasonably requires at least occasional connection to grid. Most social features probably do. Products like phones don&#8217;t even make sense without network. Web interfaces certainly do make these devices cheaper and more quickly evolving. So there are certainly good reasons beyond roping you in to make them partially off-loaded on web.</p>
<p>However I don&#8217;t want to use those features and I certainly don&#8217;t want to give up data I care about for features I don&#8217;t. What I expect from devices I buy is my control of data and purchased functionality without others meddling or peeking over my shoulders.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=1022" rel="bookmark">On ubiquitousness of 3D printing</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>As a proponent of a view that 3D printing will radically change our society I read with great interest <a title=" The Future of 3D Printing: Mere Misnomer or Something More?" href="http://www.core77.com/blog/digital_fabrication/the_future_of_3d_printing_mere_misnomer_or_something_more_23835.asp">a bunch</a> <a title="3D Printers Are Not Like 2D Printers: A Rant" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other/">of articles</a> <a title="3D Printing — Then, Now and in the Future" href="http://www.prsnlz.me/blogs/guestblog/3d-printing-then-now-and-in-the-future/">with a less </a><a title="erspective on 3D printers from a mechanical designer" href="http://graehamdouglas.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/3d-printers-are-not-the-future-of-manufacturing/">enthusiastic outlook</a> written by people who obviously have more relevant experience and knowledge than me. They don&#8217;t quite reach a consensus, but have a fairly uniform sentiment I would like to address. While I do agree with most of their arguments and conclusions, I don&#8217;t with all and more importantly I think they are kind of missing the point.</p>
<p>The above linked articles are really worth reading, but hopefully I won&#8217;t do them too much of disservice if I sum them up with: 3D printing will be too costly, too difficult, not useful enough and of too low general quality to have the same pattern of adoption as 2D printers which means they won&#8217;t end up in every home (with some type of computer).</p>
<p>Each of these points is true right now. It costs more to print an otherwise mass produced item (especially if you need to also buy a 3D printer). Of course this becomes less relevant if you want to create things that are not mass produced (<a title="My 3D print fix for a design problem" href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=827">or at all</a>), but even then you would be better off using an existing printing service (as I did). However cost of printers and materials have come down tremendously in last few years and it&#8217;s not difficult for me to imagine that at some point they will become accessible enough to become an impulsive buy. If we only bought stuff we need when it makes rational economic sense, we would own far fewer things than we do. Often they just have to become cheap enough and as cars attest that doesn&#8217;t even mean cheap.</p>
<p>It is also true that preparing models for printing is not easy. However it is much easier than it used to be and I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t become even more so in the same way as have tools for other once specialist tasks (like photo editing). I am old enough to remember word processing of mid 80-ies and as much as  incanting commands was unappealing then, you don&#8217;t see many people needing to struggle with this today. And there could be even more help in form of existing downloadable designs or 3D scanners which could reduce burden of design from scratch to making small corrections instead.</p>
<p>Will we need printers often enough? No idea. I print on paper only before traveling and would likely use 3D printer more often, but I suspect I represent mostly me. I don&#8217;t know why anyone would still need a printer, but enough of them do that there is no shortage of models aimed at home owners. I did notice how my brush with 3D printing changed the way I perceive plasticity of my environment and while it is hard to tell how my view and use would be shaped if printing was even more accessible (I expect more things would get fixed instead of replaced), it is even harder to imagine that they wouldn&#8217;t. I am sure this would be even more true for kids growing in environment which is more pliable than today&#8217;s.</p>
<p>An often repeated argument is that quality of printed stuff is not high enough. This may well be in most cases, but I expect will be less so over time. I don&#8217;t expect cheap printers or materials to catch up with expensive brethren or other options anytime soon if ever, but they may not need to. <a title="Description on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript">Illuminated manuscripts</a> were supplanted by printed books even though they <strong>never</strong> achieved their quality. Books simply became good enough. As millions of Instagram photos prove deficiencies can also lead to its own esthetic (but I wouldn&#8217;t count on this).</p>
<p>It is difficult if not foolish to predict future of a particular technology, but when I do attempt it, I try to do two things. One is to list all its current limitations and try to imagine a future without them. If technology is not interesting enough without them, then it&#8217;s really hopeless. The other thing I do is to look at development so far and try to extrapolate what will happen to those limitations and how soon from technological and wider social context stand point.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect 3D printing to follow an adoption curve of some other technology as this rarely happens. There is indeed a fundamental difference best captured by <a title="Check fourth paragraph" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other/">Jon Evans&#8217; observation</a> that we print on paper to convey information and use 3D printers to produce stuff. I do believe home 3D printers will eventually be at least as prevalent as paper printers if for no other reason because our appetite for stuff won&#8217;t go away as much as our need to use paper as a transport medium. However I also expect them to be present in houses void of geeks.</p>
<p>But my real point is that this doesn&#8217;t really matter. It seems there is an agreement that this technology together with others will radically transform our society and that bespoke manufacturing for individuals will again become more prevalent. Unless your business model absolutely depends on pushing millions of these printers in every home, does it really matter if I will print my designs on my printer or at a nearby corner shop?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it does as I don&#8217;t care if additive approach of printers wins over subtractive one of mills (however I find grinding inherently less appealing). In any case I do expect personal manufacturing to influence but not eradicate manufacturing industry and it will be interesting to see how much of it will see it as a threat needed to be countered.</p>

			<h1 class="storytitle"><a href="http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=971" rel="bookmark">Bolivia &#8211; land of llamas, mines and amazing beauty</a></h1>

			<div class="post-text">
				<p>It&#8217;s been a month since we returned from our  traveling around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. It was the most exhausting trip I have ever done and I ended up so weak that what ought to be a minor cold landed me in bed for few days. Luckily this happened only <em>after</em> our return, but still I didn&#8217;t get to write this post then and I&#8217;ve been struggling to find time for it every since.</p>
<p><a class="imageR" title="Photos from Bolivia" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/sets/72157630657887612/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/7606099564_1cc119998a_n.jpg" alt="Red hills" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>I am not sure why I was so tired. We did spend quite a lot of time trekking, but not really more than we are used to. I suspect it had something to do with high altitude and sheer amount of information my brains tried to digest. A month of travel may sound long<sup><a id="bolivia-1" href="#bolivia-note-1">[1]</a></sup>, but it&#8217;s really too short to get to know a country especially one so big and unfamiliar as Bolivia. Best you can hope for is to learn enough to give your ignorance a bit of  a shape.</p>
<p>It is also too short because you will need more time than you expect. One advice you hear often is that something will go wrong. It happened to us too and though you can be disappointed at times, you&#8217;ll mostly have fun, be amazed<sup><a id="bolivia-2" href="#bolivia-note-2">[2]</a></sup> and sometimes even shocked. Our schedule was packed and it will take me months to process all that we have seen and experienced, but I hope we can return soon.</p>
<p>Finding reasons to visit Bolivia is easy. Finding help for organizing this trip may prove more difficult. Pick an agency and search will turn up somebody who had a horrible experience with them. Not us though. We met amazing people who really worked hard to make our trip unforgettable which leads me to real reason for writing this post.</p>
<p>If you intend to go and would like some local help, here are our recommendations.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of hotels in La Paz and mid range <a href="http://www.hotelrosario.com/la-paz/">hotel Rosario</a> has deservedly consistently high reviews. It has great front desk staff (especially Ximenia), nice rooms and location. Dinners are consistently great too, but I would avoid lunch. Same kitchen but apparently different team and what you get might not be <em>exactly</em> what you ordered.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.america-ecotours.com/">America Tours</a> is a travel agency recommended by Lonely Planet which can help you organize your way around country. Speed with which they were able to organize alternatives to our cancelled our trip to Madidi (thanks Amazsonas for nothing) was simply amazing.</p>
<p>Most people who visit Potosi stay in town. It&#8217;s certainly cheaper than alternatives, but if you can afford it, then a good place to stay is at <a href="http://www.hotelmuseocayara.com/">hotel museo Cayara</a> that is about half an hour drive away. Museum and a chance to talk to Arturo alone are worth it. Hacienda that has been there since 1557 is in the middle of beautiful nature and away of polluted surroundings of Potosi and is a popular destination for daily trips organized by travel agencies in Potosi (a good alternative for those on small budgets).</p>
<p>Usual way of seeing the largest salt flat in world is to travel to Uyuni and take a trip with one of many unreliable operators who are often hostages to their prone-to-drinking drivers. I believe it is better to travel to Tupiza (if you have time) and take a slightly longer tour. We had really good experience with <a href="http://www.tupizatours.com/index.php">Tupiza Tours</a>, but my advice to those who prefer email for arranging their trips, is to start at least a couple of weeks before they go because girls at Tupiza Tours seem to be swamped in work. Or call them if you can. If you pick them, then ask for Hernan Cordova, the best off-road driver we have ever met (and Spanish speaking guide), and Jeaneth Menchaca Condori if you need an English speaking guide. They went above and beyond their duty, really made every effort to anticipate our wishes and needs and had an unlimited amount of patience.</p>
<p>There are many agencies in La Paz that will take you trekking and prices vary significantly. <a href="http://www.andeansummits.com/">Andean Summits</a> is certainly not among the cheapest, but they are very professional and accommodating (like with our last minute request to change dates of our trek). Ask also for Gustavo Miranda Hulliri, who apart from being a great cook and camp manager also seems to know every path there is. This can be really useful if you, say, get really weak because you were throwing up all previous day.</p>
<p>Tourist guides in Bolivia have to be certified. Most of them studied tourism and are very good. Still we were especially impressed by Julia Catunta Janco who consistently surprised us with showing us things we wouldn&#8217;t even think of asking. She would be our first choice unless you go climbing. Contact me if you need her email address.</p>
<p>One sure sign that your guide was really good is that saying goodbye feels like leaving a good friend. It is a feeling we didn&#8217;t expect before, but felt repeatedly once we were there. Life is too short to visit every place we would like to see, but I still have no doubt that we will return. I hope this post has been of some help to those of you who might be thinking of visiting Bolivia.</p>

<li id="bolivia-note-1">Popular stereotype of a Japanese tourist used to be someone who took pictures non-stop. Someone explained to me once that this is a necessary memory aid for short vacations with packed schedule because it can help you recall and organize memories later when you&#8217;re back. I don&#8217;t know if this is true for Japanese, but it is certainly true for me.<a href="#bolivia-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="bolivia-note-2">I knew Bolivia was rich in minerals, but I had no idea that there were so many mines which often exist in the most inhospitable places. Even big scale mining (such as for silver around Potosi) is usually done individually and this is even more true for small mines where there may be only 10 or so miners risking their life. It&#8217;s very hard and often short way to live that can still be better than alternatives.<a href="#bolivia-1">↩</a></li>
