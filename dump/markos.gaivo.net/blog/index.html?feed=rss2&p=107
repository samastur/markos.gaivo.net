		<description>Sure it is.

It might be less angst-ridden than most and hopefully there are not all that many posts that fit look-at-stupid-people-who-don&#039;t-think-like-me category, but it&#039;s still a blog.

This blog is not literature that it would somehow have to stay &quot;real&quot;. It&#039;s a place where I try to share what I know and express what I think and it won&#039;t stop being that even if I listen to what others have to say about it and change a thing or two. I&#039;d ascribe it to personal growth.

Thank you both for your comments.</description>

		<description>What would readers like to see? Hm ... I thought that blogging is about writing about things you feel necessary to write about ... and then readers deceide if they&#039;re interesting to them or not. If you write your &quot;blog&quot; to please your readers, is it still a blog?</description>

		<description>I think your posting frequency was just fine, so I think you should just keep writing like you did in 2005 :)</description>
