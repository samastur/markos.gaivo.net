  <dt>CAESAR.</dt> <dd>I could be well moved, if I were as you;<br />
    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;<br />
    But I am constant as the northern star,<br />
    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality<br />
    There is no fellow in the firmament.<br />
    The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks; <br />
    They are all fire and every one doth shine;<br />
    But there's but one in all doth hold his place.<br />
    So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,<br />
    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;<br />
    Yet in the number I do know but one<br />
    That unassailable holds on his rank,<br />
    Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,<br />
    Let me a little show it, even in this;<br />
    That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,<br />
    And constant do remain to keep him so.</dd>
  <dt>CINNA.</dt> <dd>O Caesar-</dd>
  <dt>CAESAR.</dt> <dd>Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?</dd>
  <dt>DECIUS.</dt> <dd>Great Caesar-</dd>
  <dt>CAESAR.</dt> <dd>Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</dd>
  <dt>CASCA.</dt> <dd>Speak, hands, for me!<br />
                        Casca first, then the other Conspirators<br />
                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.</dd>
  <dt>CAESAR.</dt> <dd>Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.</dd>
  <dt>CINNA.</dt> <dd>Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!<br />
    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</dd>
