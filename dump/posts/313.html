			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I often find myself in a room with web developers and at least one of them proclaiming that IE6 sucks because it doesn&#8217;t support web standards while others nod in agreement.</p>
<p>This has bothered me enough to contemplate having a talk at <a href="http://www.barcamp.si/">BarCamp Ljubljana</a>. I didn&#8217;t, but this is what I would say.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 6" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</a> was released on 27th August 2001, when twin towers were still standing in NY.</p>
<p>7 years is a long time to remember, but what did we work with back then? There was no <a class="zem_slink" title="Safari (web browser)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and Firefox was still in its infacy, far from 1.0 release coming 3 years later. It was changing so often most developers simply ignored it. Opera was at version 5 (version 6 came out in November of that year) and I am sure I am not alone in remembering how awful it was at least until version 7 in 2003. <a class="zem_slink" title="Mozilla" rel="homepage" href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> was at version 0.6 and although showing great promise, IE6 definitely was the browser we hoped others would match.</p>
<p>Back then no browser supported CSS2 in a meaningful capacity. Opera had the best support for CSS until then, but IE6 surpassed it. It didn&#8217;t support DOM Level 2, which was standardized only 4 months before first beta of IE6. Good excuse not available anymore to <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet Explorer 7" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">IE7</a> and IE8. Apart from that it supported more or less everything web developer could want back then and then some. IE6 problem isn&#8217;t so much that it didn&#8217;t support standards of its time as it is that it doesn&#8217;t support standards of today.</p>
<p>So why the hostility?</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Lancia Delta" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta">Lancia Delta Integrale</a>, which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don&#8217;t hear them go around complaining how it doesn&#8217;t meet standards of todays cars.</p>
<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve said, 7 years is a long time and most web developers are not old gits like me, so the historic context isn&#8217;t there. We also have to live with its real shortcomings today. But I think there&#8217;s more to this.</p>
<p>Complaining about IE6 standards deficiencies is declaring who you are and where you stand. It&#8217;s a simple and very recognizable way of declaring you are a member of web-standards tribe. IE6 bitching has at least as much to do with proclaimer as with proclamation&#8217;s subject. Trashing IE6 isn&#8217;t so much talking about the browser as it is talking about you.</p>
<p>However it is not unreasonable to ask why IE6 doesn&#8217;t better support standards that were released or updated after its initial release.</p>
<p>Certainly more could be done through software updates, but are standards themselves forward looking in a way that would avoid updating browser internals with every new version of a particular standard?</p>
<p>I am quite certain that this isn&#8217;t always possible. I don&#8217;t see how you could add a video object from <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML 5" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5">HTML5</a> to a browser without explicit support from browser&#8217;s developers. But not all changes are such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5">John Allsopp</a> has recently pointed out.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about HTML5. It&#8217;s bringing much needed new capabilities and lots of goodies, but I also think <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/15/Grandiosity">Sam Ruby</a> has a point. New, simple, <a class="zem_slink" title="Document Type Declaration" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration">DOCTYPE</a> is reduced to a switch between standards and <a class="zem_slink" title="Quirks mode" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode">quirks mode</a> and unless it will become more complicated in later revisions, it won&#8217;t offer an easy way to distinguish between HTML5 documents and other HTML versions. This isn&#8217;t a particular problem if newer revisions will be backwards compatible with older, but this isn&#8217;t true even of HTML5. Why would we think this is the last version where we will make a major misstep that needs backwards-incompatible correction?</p>
<p>There are other things I don&#8217;t like about HTML5, but if I would have to pick one thing I would like to see changed, is to make it more extendable.</p>
<p>To sum it up, IE6 is indeed a problem in todays development, but it&#8217;s also at least at fault for this. It was an excellent browser when it came out and is remarkably solid one for software so old. There are many reasons, completely untouched in this post, why its users don&#8217;t migrate to something newer, but we, web developers, are also to blame, because we tend to standardize only current practice and leave few doors open for future development which invariably comes.</p>

						<p>A nice insight into state of the web (development) of those days &#8211; I never thought of IE6 as ground-breaking for it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Maybe that is one of the problems of youth that gets addressed with time &#8230;</p>

						<p>Seveda IE6 sam po sebi ni ni?? kriv, kompjuterji so vedno nedolžni &#8211;  krivi smo neumni in sebi??ni programerji. In ??eprav je lahko bil IE6 enkrat OK browser bi se pri MS vseeno lahko potrudili in povohali standarde že takrat &#8211; w3c obstaja od leta 94 &#8211; ampak problem je v tem, ker je MS hotel tudi tukaj monopol. Ki pa sploh ne bi bil problem, ??e bi ljudje zadeve updejtal.  Mislm da je bolj vprašanje tukaj &#8211; zakaj se to ne zgodi?</p>
<p>&#8220;web developers, are also to blame&#8221; &#8211; web developerji nimamo z razvojem standardov prakti??no ni??. Govora je o tem kakšne standarde omogo??ajo browserji, in torej kakšne smo web developerji sploh zmožni upoštevat.</p>
<p>In Lancia še vedno ustavi ob rde??em semaforju &#8211; IE6 je v tej primerjavi prej lokomotiva na paro kot pa old-timer.</p>

						<p>I bash IE6 on a regular basis although I&#8217;ve been around long enough to remember version 4. But you&#8217;re right &#8211; I&#8217;m not really bashing IE6. I&#8217;m bashing the fact that I still have to optimize for it in January 2009. IE7 was released in October 2006. That&#8217;s more than 5 years between 2 major versions of the world&#8217;s most popular browser! Those were the 5 years in which the whole Web 2.0 story happened, 5 years in which we changed the way we build and perceive web pages. Microsoft even managed to release a new major version of the Office suite in that time but not IE (can&#8217;t make money on it and, besides, it had no serious competition back then). IE6 was fine when it was released, I agree, but it should have been ancient history long time ago and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m bashing at: the fact that it did not occur to Microsoft for 5 years that they owe it to their customers to constantly improve the most important piece of software on their personal computers.</p>

						<p>&#8220;Lancia Delta Integrale, which dominated rally competitions in eighties, is today an obsolete car, but car aficionados still have a soft sport for it. You don’t hear them go around complaining how it doesn’t meet standards of todays cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, does the car bother the road makers? I think you missed it here, because we complain about IE6 because other people are &#8220;driving&#8221; it on &#8220;our&#8221; roads, and we need to make them compatible( or at least, needed to do ). So, IE6 was making extra work to modern devs, but this car does not make extra work for road maintainers. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no execuse for IE Team or whole Microsoft for the mess they have done.</p>
