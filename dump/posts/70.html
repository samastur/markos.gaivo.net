			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I spent a good part of last year studying things like marketing, pricing and so on, which are completely untechnical in nature, but very much essential for a success of any company. I&#8217;m far from being an expert in any of these fields, but every now and then I come across an example, that leaves me dumbfounded in its amazing stupidity. It seems like incompetence is limitless and some people receive quite a lot of money to show off theirs.</p>
<p>Practically every textbook I&#8217;ve read taught me that the basic approach to marketing is to have a clear message of what you&#8217;re offering and why this is beneficial to people you&#8217;re selling to. With enough repetition you might have a chance of making them remember you. I certainly don&#8217;t think this is the only way to do it, but it&#8217;s probably the most tried and tested method out there.</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a new fashion in Slovenia. Create ads that don&#8217;t tell you anything. I&#8217;m not thinking of weird ads that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a company or product they&#8217;re pushing. No, I mean ads with literally nothing on except a word like <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">IZI</a> (bastardized easy) or <a href="http://www.t-2.net">T-2</a>. I guess it might have been intriguing if it wasn&#8217;t so overused.</p>
<p>However, last example with izi really takes the cake. First there were ads showing either just izi or if you were lucky, also a link to <a href="http://www.naizi.si">naizi.si</a>. As already mentioned, they were ads for <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">izimobil</a>. Now, go look at the  <a href="http://www.naizi.si">site</a> and find anything that could point a visitor to <a href="http://www.izimobil.si">izimobil.si</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll buy you a beer, if you can do it in next 24 hours. Or any other beverage of your choice.</p>
<p>Back? I couldn&#8217;t do it either. It&#8217;s hard to imagine there isn&#8217;t one, but it&#8217;s certainly well hidden. &#8217;cause you know, people really want to dig around the site looking for what you&#8217;re about, right?</p>
<p>Their ad campaign has been expanded in last day or so as they came out with jumbo ads promoting izimobil more directly and they&#8217;re trying to do so with a slogan:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Prvi slovenski virtualni operater mobilne telefonije.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Or in English: <strong>&#8220;First slovenian virtual mobile operator.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p>Was that supposed to persuade me to do something? Does virtual mean they&#8217;re not real? Which part should register as something positive with me?</p>
<p>Apart from being almost meaningless, it&#8217;s also wrong, if being virtual alludes to using some <a href="http://www.mobitel.si">other company&#8217;s</a> mobile network. <a href="http://www.debitel.si/">Debitel</a> did it first, although not as a prepaid operator and I know of no one, who would find that fact alone appealing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying their ad campaign won&#8217;t have positive effects. Hell, you can get them by showing dancing bananas and pie fights, as long as you&#8217;re willing to spend enough money on it. But somehow I doubt it&#8217;s an economical way to market your product.</p>
