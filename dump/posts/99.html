				<p>I used to be a part-time system administrator and have a few colleagues who still are. So I&#8217;m fairly used to regular complaints about (l)users and a delusional sense of self-importance. Yet, it&#8217;s still a rare week in which I&#8217;d read a bunch of articles (with comments) like <a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html">this one</a>  and had so many discussions about what and how should our users behave.</p>
<p>I think most comments were simply rubbish. You have no reason to complain as long as they are polite and not intentionally obstructive.</p>
<p>The thing I always admired about <a href="http://www.mobitel.si">Mobitel</a> is the way they treat their customers. It doesn&#8217;t matter how little do they know about phones, phone plans or even their own needs and desires, you can be sure that Mobitel&#8217;s personnel will take the time and energy necessary to explain, show and resolve whatever is needed. They certainly don&#8217;t expect me to come loaded with information and spend more of my time to save theirs.</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about plumbing and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a fact well known and obvious to every plumber I&#8217;ve met. But did they ever treat me like an idiot? No, because it&#8217;s understood that they have to know so I don&#8217;t have to. I simply can&#8217;t know everything and wouldn&#8217;t want to, because there are other, more important things that I should be doing. I might help with my answers to their questions, but it&#8217;s not really expected of me to do anything more than to show the problem.</p>
<p>I understand frustrations when dealing with too many problems and too little time. I also know that there&#8217;s always a small percentage of users who simply are assholes. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s ever acceptable to be impolite, but I understand it sometimes happens.</p>
<p>Life can be hard, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that our task is to provide a service, to serve our users and not the other way around. And if we have a problem doing this, it&#8217;s us who must resolve it not them. In fact, without them  &#8220;pests&#8221; there&#8217;s little need for what we provide. After all a perfectly configured and RFC compliant mail server is just a box of toxic waste without someone sending emails through it.</p>
<p>Some professions get this. As Woody Allen rightly pointed out, it really is a bitch to get a plumber (on Sunday).</p>
