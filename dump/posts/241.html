			<div class="post-text">
				<p>I&#8217;ve recently read couple of posts that left an impression on me. First one was Brad Neuberg&#8217;s about <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2007/08/creating-personal-research-agenda.html">personal research agenda</a>. I haven&#8217;t completed list of my problems yet, but I came far enough to know I&#8217;m not working on any of them.</p>
<p>The other one was about <a href="http://www.entrepreneur2be.com/2007/08/26/idea-blog-socialnetworking-blog20/">Blog 2.0</a>. I&#8217;m more interested in content manipulation than social interactions as Pownce and Marela are only two social networking applications I use. Still, ideas contained are intriguing and couple of days before <a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/">Data Sharing Summit</a> is the right time to shamelessly pimp my views.</p>
<p>Build a social application and you will likely, sooner or later, encounter a dilemma in what your members will be building. Are their creations mainly personal, an expression of their creativity, or are they more of a place where people meet and engage?</p>
<p>Most websites don&#8217;t fall squarely into one or the other. My blog feels personal not only because I picked the look and topics, but also because my voice is elevated above others. I doubt I would feel the same if comments could look like my posts. I like my place and freedom it offers me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t care all that much about most networks and degrees of their openness. Really open social network would be interwoven into the fabric of web. I already have my page, I don&#8217;t need yet another one. If buddy list is desired, I can use FOAF. Sharing of my stuff? Feeds. Same answer for getting other people&#8217;s stuff. Starting a new network would mean creating a widget or a few that can be easily integrated in our sites, maybe some sort of a pinging service if expediency is important and offering a space for personal page for those, who don&#8217;t have it yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how little would need to be changed to implement ideas in Blog 2.0. Basic technology is already here, it&#8217;s just not used widely enough yet. Sure there are a few issues that need to be thought through, mainly to do with handling privacy correctly, but they are neither big nor really technological. And price for all this?</p>
<p>Maybe a bit less expediency in content propagation and a bit more work for network operators, who might need to learn to live with the same limitations that search engine developers do already. And I&#8217;m not even sure that is really necessary.</p>
<p><em>Update: </em>Thinking a bit more about this I would be happy enough if social network were just more inclusive. It&#8217;s fine that you can create an account and be busy on their platform, but it would be better if you could join and interact with a social network with your own node for as long as that met your needs.</p>
