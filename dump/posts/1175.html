				<p>Autumn was busy and I did not finish any of the posts I started. I won’t do that now either, but at least I can try to soothe my guilty conscience by getting my rougher than usual thoughts out with hope of updating and polishing them later.</p>
<p>I expect it doesn’t take much effort to dig up words younger me wrote full of misplaced certainty and eagerness to <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">set things right</a>. No doubt I can still display both of these “virtues”, but I try not to and to limit the damage I use few psychological tricks such as postponing reply when possible, concentrating first on non-contentious parts when it isn’t and asking questions to help me understand how probable it is that I am wrong and what is driving my response. I&#8217;ve been compiling questions and this is what I have so far:</p>
<p><em>Do I want to believe in the result or position? Does it benefit or suit me?</em><br />
You can always be wrong, but there’s better than usual chance of this when your beliefs coincide with your incentives whatever those are<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-1" href="#avoid-stupid-1-note">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>How do I feel about a problem if I replace the group A in it with some other group B?</em><br />
Do I feel or think differently about an issue if it involves a stranger instead of a friend or gays instead of women? If yes, then why? Are reasons substantial and substantiated or do they point to a prejudice?</p>
<p><em>Why am I trying to say this?</em><br />
Not what I am trying to say! It’s easy to have an opinion, but I avoid voicing most of them by being sufficiently busy. So when I do want to speak up I try to understand the motives driving me since they are also the source of biases.</p>
<p><em>Is it a matter of a principle or degree?</em><br />
I see this mistake most often when new technological developments are judged on assumptions that may (soon) not be true anymore, but the problem is general. When disagreeing with something I try to imagine conditions under which I wouldn’t and the likelihood of those conditions. Their likelihood not only tells me how fundamentally am I disagreeing with something, but also how likely I think it is, both of which can lead to new insight<sup><a id="avoid-stupid-2" href="#avoid-stupid-2-note">[2]</a>.</sup></p>
<p><em>Can I be persuaded?</em><br />
I can’t be on every issue and am suspicious of those who can be. If I can come up with a realistic set of conditions that would change my view, then I have something to test it against. If I can’t, then stop since I am not having a dialog.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always run through all these questions, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who wishes I did. This unordered list is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it over time. Suggestions are also welcome.</p>
