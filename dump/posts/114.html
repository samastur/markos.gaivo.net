			<div class="post-text">
				<p>When I was in Stockholm, I listened to a podcast of Bran Ferren&#8217;s talk at Web 2.0 conference. He made a case that knowledge workers need tools and user interfaces that put increased productivity as a goal above ease of use or learn. It&#8217;s well worth <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail852.html">listening to</a>, if you haven&#8217;t heard it yet.</p>
<p>The point is certainly valid even if mouse and other stuff Doug Engelbart invented were created with this same goal in mind. I disagree partially with iPod example, since I believe easy of use is what made iPod wildly popular instead of something like Creative Zen (which still can&#8217;t get real traction in the market), but there&#8217;s a need and opportunity for tools that make us more productive. I&#8217;d count Unix command line between them, which makes me more productive even if it&#8217;s not easy to use and even less to learn. There&#8217;s a problem though.</p>
<p>Nobody is a knowledge worker in every field.</p>
<p>Or as Alan Cooper <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672316498/ref=ase_codinghorror-20/102-1133436-5350547?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;tagActionCode=codinghorror-20">said</a>, we are perpetual intermediates who most of the time want to learn only as much as needed but not more. We can be experts only in very few things. We have neither the time nor inclination to become proficient with everything we do and do we have the tools to make other endeavors as painless as possible?</p>
<p>I think when talking about gadgets and computers the answer is generally no.</p>
<p>The problem lies not in keyboard and mouse. They are general purpose tools (like hammer) widely used mainly because computers are also general purpose tools and most of us use them as such. When specific needs become crystalized enough, we usually get input devices to match, like tablets for designers or joysticks for gamers. I&#8217;m sure more could be done and Bran seems to be the kind of person who will do it, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s where computers fail us.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the software, which should be either fun and easy to use or make us more productive, preferably both but by large does neither of those.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that iPods are rare and you&#8217;ll often find (as with Unix CLI) that you have to choose between making a more productive tool and making more fun one. But not being a beginner is not a permission to abuse me and most software would benefit if it dropped the pretense of being an expert tool and rather worked really hard on being easy to manipulate. As a rule of thumb, if you can&#8217;t charge at least 300$ for it, it&#8217;s not an expert tool.</p>
<p>So, this is what we are tying to do with <a href="http://www.marela.si">Marela</a>,  it&#8217;s our mission. We have and will continue to work on making life in digital age enjoyable. It&#8217;s big and ambitious enough goal to keep us busy for a while.</p>
<p>And I still think mouse was just a brilliant invention.</p>
