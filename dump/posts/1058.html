				<p>Happy and healthy new year!</p>
<p>Mine started as it ended, in bed with a nasty cold. We were in one of few places in Slovenia where there was snow, great weather and I got to experience it all mostly through windows. In a way it was a perfect sum of last year: missed opportunities and unexpected disappointments, but at the same time actually quite good if looked at from a different perspective. 2012 was a year full of health scares, not all of which were resolved happily (so far). I certainly hope this year will be better for my loved ones.</p>
<p>I learned last year that I don&#8217;t miss Twitter. Occasionally I read <a title="Marko's Twitter account" href="http://twitter.com/friedcell">Fry</a>&#8216;s stream, but otherwise end up there only by mistake. There&#8217;s still work to be done on how to manage empty distractions and I miss tools that would help me decide what to read and how much of it. Facebook account &#8212; also gone (I hope; who can really tell?). Rarely used, never missed and incompatible with my convictions.</p>
<p>Digital sabbath continues to be a great idea and I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. Setting too ambitious personal goals&#8230;to be avoided. Explicit goals can lead to worse results when it becomes clear they can&#8217;t be met, even more so if they morph from a metric to a substitute of original purpose. Knowing this I nevertheless managed to become a textbook case of a goal-induced failure and will need to spend quite a bit of effort to get in a better shape. Need to keep focusing on whys too.</p>
<p>Having a list of possible and finished projects on wall still frees my mind. I have just <a title="Image Diet - reduce size of images" href="https://github.com/samastur/image-diet">released one</a> of them, but it is obvious I haven&#8217;t really stayed the course this year, switching projects with predictable result of finishing few and losing a bet with <a title="Sebastjan's Twitter account" href="https://twitter.com/trepca">Sebastjan</a>. You could look at it as the most expensive dinner of my life (if valued by time spent) or a hell of a good investment in code I will use this year. I prefer the latter (and what kind of twat would object to paying friend&#8217;s dinner).</p>
<p>I actually did work on my personal research agenda in my spare time. I just don&#8217;t have enough of it and it is what I struggle with most. I found development proceeds more smoothly when done regularly, but to do that I need to maintain a very detailed to-do list which allows me to make a meaningful contribution even when there is only half an hour to spare. I have also added reminders to my calendar to regularly review (or re-awake) my work.</p>
<p>I decided to stop using these end of year posts for commenting on  external developments. So far mostly impotent protests in Slovenia left a  bittersweet taste. I am curious what this year will bring, but these  reviews tended to be bleak and I&#8217;m not becoming an optimist.</p>
<p>I am happier. It really is a privilege to, not just nominally, work with and for people from whole planet on stuff that matters. I learned a lot as person and a developer from <a title="Aptivate's team page" href="http://www.aptivate.org/en/about/team/">my colleagues</a> and I enjoy my work as much as when I started. However getting accustomed to our way of doing things and things we do can create a small worry of where I will be able to work, if I ever have to leave.</p>
<p>It was definitely a year of personal change. Not sure who to &#8220;blame&#8221; for rediscovering a radical streak in me, but I am less willing to be silent when encountering prejudice and small-mindedness. Silence condones and some troubles should be embraced.</p>
<p>This year I would like to finish <a title="All you ever wanted to learn about Slovenian Parliament" href="http://www.delajozate.si/">existing</a> <a title="Great upcoming personal photo sharing app" href="https://github.com/samastur/marela2">projects</a> that already have good foundations and to promote building web services for low-bandwidth environments (where low-bandwidth doesn&#8217;t mean just slow). That really should be enough. I expect it will be an interesting year.</p>
