				<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Joshua Porter" rel="blog" href="http://bokardo.com">Joshua Porter&#8217;s</a> workshop at recent UX London conference was great and a must see if you can, but there is something that&#8217;s been bugging me since. In discussion about difficulties of getting people to sign-up for service, Joshua mentioned how some companies see connecting with <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook Connect" rel="homepage" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> as Facebook &#8220;owning&#8221; their users.</p>
<p>They are right, but it doesn&#8217;t matter much. Relying on Facebook for authentication certainly makes Facebook sort of a gatekeeper. This does not matter because it can and should be a transitional phase in an evolving relationship.</p>
<p>My view is based on assumption that company wants to build a long lasting relationship with a customer. This may not be true, but then there really is no point in having a sign-up at all. Avoid friction of one, make a trade and move on.</p>
<p>I think most user lifecycle strategies look like trying to get laid by the end of evening while hoping to start a long-term relationship. It might work, but how likely?</p>
<p>There are two things relationships need. Continuing benefit to parties involved and mutual trust. And trust is built through actions over time.</p>
<p>Traditional UX life cycle can be seen as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Awareness -&gt; Sign-up -&gt; First-time use -&gt; Engagement -&gt; Referral</p></blockquote>
<p>Each step has to offer more benefits to person taking it as it requires more trust. Moving sign-up after first-time use changes dynamic by making service prove itself before asking same of its user.</p>
<p>Using Facebook Connect (or <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="OpenID Foundation" rel="homepage" href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>&#8230;) is just going further in mimicking natural relationship building. It&#8217;s asking of a smaller commitment at a fragile stage of relationship. You can ask for a bigger commitment with your own authentication later on, when you have already proven your worth and gain enough trust. You could even offer something available only to &#8220;full&#8221; members to make such commitment more enticing.</p>
<p>If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?</p>
<p>Hence sign-up should be thought of as a gradual process taken over time instead of one-time obstacle.</p>
<p>All this is just speculation at this point, but I hope to test it on two projects this year. If I do, I&#8217;ll let you know how it went.</p>

						<p>Hi Marko,</p>
<p>This is an interesting conundrum you raise. While Facebook integration does make it easy for people to &#8220;sign up&#8221; to certain websites, the website owner does not get that user&#8217;s registration details which is important in terms of keeping them informed of site updates, marketing messages etc.</p>
<p>You said: &#8220;If you are building years long relationship like I have with Amazon, does it really matter if you get me to fully sign-up after third month instead of first?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would probably argue that yes it does matter from an income point of view because then Amazon have lost out on potentially two months worth of marketing opportunities. If you are an avid customer of Amazon, they could have sold you a lot more products!</p>

						<p>Good point and thank you for comment.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is true only if value you gain from that marketing is greater than value you lose from people who left, but otherwise wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What Facebook Connect is for visitors is trust by proxy. I might not trust you enough, but I do Facebook to enter. Hence strong brands have less to gain from it than weaker.</p>
<p>I guess at the end, like with so many other things, it depends on particular case (website).</p>

						<p>@Markos &#8211; good point regarding the &#8216;Trust&#8217; aspect, I certainly agree with that as I too would be far more likely to go through Facebook rather than initially directly.</p>

						<p>I guess it can encourage more people to sign up. It is then up to us to build the deeper trust moving forward. Once that is achieve users are more likely to do further transactions.</p>

						<p>My personal opinion here is that facebook authentication is actually more intrusive at least for me &#8211; I don&#8217;t feel comfortable sharing my FB profile with just about everyone&#8230; there should be some segmentation created so that the user can manage who sees what. My 2 cents.</p>

						<p>Facebook should be recognized as an opportunity to reach the masses for one&#8217;s particular site however, I agree to make it more enticing to sign up for one&#8217;s site an incentive to become a &#8220;full member&#8221; is a step in the right direction. While it&#8217;s true that those on FB don&#8217;t particularly like signing up for all site&#8217;s that come their way, an incentive will make them look twice and at least consider it. Just a thought.</p>

						<p>Markos, I completely agree Facebook Connect allows for a smaller less established site to gain that all important &#8220;trust factor&#8221;.<br />
MNels, great point about giving an incentive to people who sign up for a full membership. I guess the trick is to offer an incentive so good it would make someone think twice before signing up through Facebook Connect.</p>
