			<div class="post-text">
				<p>Title says it. A month is enough time to get a better understanding of the device and to get asked repeatedly about my impressions. Many have wrote theirs, so I doubt I will be telling anything really new. Before I go on, a short disclaimer, since my writings on this blog stay around longer than might be sensible.</p>
<p>I wrote this post at the start of February 2010. I believe everything I write about technology to be hopelessly out of date after 6 months, but I expect this article will be obsolete even sooner. So by the time you got around reading this, most of my gripes might not even be true anymore.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Nokia N900" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900">Nokia N900</a> is an uncut diamond. A wonderful thing made by talented designers that has quite a few rough edges, not all of them in device. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to most people, but to some of you it might become your favorite computer. It goes with me almost anywhere.</p>
<p>If you want a rock solid phone, then this device is not for you. I was unlucky to be in minority of people who experienced constant reboots. By constant I mean few times every hour.? My <a class="zem_slink" title="Nokia" rel="homepage" href="http://nokia.com">Nokia</a> also lacked a 2GB partition, which meant I was constantly running out of space in which to install applications. Both of this problems have since been fixed. I still have a problem with <a class="zem_slink" title="GSM" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM">GSM</a> connection occasionally completely dying, which I can fix only by manual reboot. I&#8217;m personally not bothered since I don&#8217;t use it as phone.</p>
<p>On the other hand updates to software are regular, with one major firmware update already, that fixed some of my problems (reboot). Annoyances of today might literally be gone by tomorrow and thus my disclaimer.</p>
<p>I know how much effort goes in good software and don&#8217;t want to be too negative, but email really does suck for IMAP users. Not only doesn&#8217;t it cache headers, so if you have a slow connection and a big Inbox, get used to waiting. You also can&#8217;t set sent mail, drafts or trash folders which makes it useless to me for anything but reading email. Even worse, it creates its own folders (like <a class="zem_slink" title="IPod Touch" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch">iPod touch</a>) to make a mess in your account. I am all for simplicity and avoiding needless configuration options, but it could at least get a list of folders and compare Levenshtein&#8217;s distance to common names (Sent, Sent mail&#8230;).</p>
<p>Gecko (Mozilla) based browser though is great, in my opinion much better than iPod&#8217;s and I completely switched my mobile browsing to N900. I am biased since unlike many I never was fond of constant zooming in and out (with pinching). My opinion might have been different if my eye-sight was poorer and I needed to zoom more.</p>
<p>If you are a Linux user or appreciate freedom, then it&#8217;s difficult to find a better mobile device. N900 is a Linux machine which happens to also be a phone and you have complete access to everything. There is a store (Ovi) and app manager, but you can install and run anything willing to run without permission from anybody. Terminal is loaded by default together with tools needed to prod into the system and root is one package installation away.</p>
<p>I dislike fixed space of iPod. N900 is only slightly better. You can expand it with SD cards, but you have to open battery cover. It looks so fragile that I don&#8217;t intend to actually do this unless absolutely necessary. Speaking of storage, as a programmer I can understand why applications can use only 2GB of it, but as user it simply looks daft.</p>
<p>Pair of contact and conversations applications is absolutely brilliant. Instant messaging, Skype and SMS are superbly integrated and they also feed contact application with information about your buddies found on those networks.? Install Hermes and you can update it with data from Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Screen has higher resolution than iPod&#8217;s, but physically same (small) size, which means I&#8217;ll keep reading PDFs on my 770. Since it&#8217;s resistive instead of capacitive, it needs more pressure than iPod&#8217;s, but works better at -12 degrees centigrade (<a title="French Alps - photo taken by N900" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markos/4268784785/">this picture</a> was taken with my gloves on).</p>
<p>Maemo has a very active and generally supportive community, but some members can also be <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6334#c19">needlessly unfriendly</a>. Just because you know where everything is and have seen certain faux pas 100 times before, it doesn&#8217;t mean either is true for a new N900 owner with a problem.</p>
<p>N900 RUNS PYTHON, which was my main reason for preferring it over an <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> phone. Documentation is a bit all over the place, not always current and I still haven&#8217;t found information about how to control built in cameras, but I am an optimist that this will be sorted out soon and that documentation will improve as well.</p>
<p>I compared N900 with diamond, but maybe a better comparison would be a sports car. If you want a polished, sedated experience then N900 is certainly not for you (yet). But if you are a tinkerer who doesn&#8217;t mind rough edges in exchange for freedom to make it do almost anything, then you should give it a spin.</p>
<p>There is so much more that could be said, but big picture wouldn&#8217;t change much. I haven&#8217;t talked much about UI since I simply couldn&#8217;t do it justice in few sentences. On the whole it works fine and multitasking is really great even though I think iPhone/iPad&#8217;s switch-to-where-you-were model is in my experience rarely a problem and wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was here to stay.</p>
<p>If there is anything about it you would like to know, then please ask and I&#8217;ll try to respond to it promptly.</p>

						<p>Hard to say since it is very dependant on what you installed and how you use it.</p>
<p>Mine is always online, often both through wifi and gsm, but I never use it as a phone. I mostly use it for browsing and communication through skype IM and jabber.</p>
<p>Battery easily lasts through day unless I use it a lot. However I doubt it would last whole weekend.</p>

						<p>Hi,<br />
I&#8217;m really keen on getting a N900 too and was able to see a few in action at LCA2010. Your comment re. the constant reboots is a worry, though, and all the N900 owners I spoke to at LCA didn&#8217;t indicate any issues like this. Are you sure this hasn&#8217;t been resolved in the recent firmware updates?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Tim</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m sorry for not being clear enough. Last firmware completely removed unwanted reboots. As a computer it is now rock solid.</p>
<p>I did continue experiencing some other problems like repeated requests to enter SIM card&#8217;s PIN code, which disappeared only after I turned PIN checking off completely. This is a security trade off not everyone is willing to make.</p>
<p>I also noticed that Xchat fairly reliably kills my GSM connection, but I need to investigate this a bit further before filling a bug report.</p>
<p>I think at this point it is a great secondary device, but I would hesitate to recommend it as the only cell phone to own. Not the least because I don&#8217;t use it as such and can&#8217;t give a reasonable judgement.</p>

						<p>Great, thanks for the prompt response. Re. your XChat issues, the guys I spoke to who had an N900 said they use irssi for IRC.</p>

						<p>First, thank you for this review. I&#8217;m thinking about getting mine in a month or so (I still need to do a &#8220;hands-on&#8221; review).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s with the MMS support? As far as I know, there isn&#8217;t any.</p>
<p>And something a bit more technical, how would you resolve localization and word permutation problems using Levenshtein&#8217;s distance?</p>
<p>B</p>

						<p>MMS isn&#8217;t officially supported yet, but there is a package called fMMS (<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/FMMS">http://wiki.maemo.org/FMMS</a>) which seems to work fine. I haven&#8217;t tested it personally.</p>
<p>As to Levenshetein&#8230;I don&#8217;t think there is a solution that solves all cases and I am fine with that. Better to pick no folder than to stuff messages into wrong one.</p>
<p>When you set up N900, you pick where you are. You also get to pick language of interface, which is a more limited choice (e.g. region lists Slovenia, but there is no Slovenian interface). This gives you a strong hint which languages to check.</p>
<p>There are 3 interesting type of folders: sent mail, drafts and trash. For each type and language you could have a list of common names (Sent, Sent messages, Sent msg&#8230;) that you check with Levenshtein with IMAP folders. If the best match is close enough (say has a distance less than 2), then you pick it and or leave defaults otherwise.</p>
<p>This is not the speediest way to do this, but probably good enough since number of IMAP folders is usually relatively small, names relatively short, Levenshtein fast and you need to do it rarely or just once.</p>
